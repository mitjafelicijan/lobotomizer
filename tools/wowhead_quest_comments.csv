For those who don't have a coordinate add-on yet, or just want an extra hint, here's what worked for my lvl 5 warlock...enter the Defias area on the far right side by the river, where it meets the wall. 

Consider the area as a U shape.  Start here:
x
U

Follow the hillside as high up as you can get & you shouldn't attract much, if any, attention of those below.  At the bottom left of the U....xU..will be about as low as you will come to the Defias.  You may need to pause and wait until the current person on guard looks and walks away to continue your run.

As you continue on the bottom part of the U, you'll eventually find that the hillside contours up and that there is a path behind the hillside that will lead you to Garrick's shack at the bottom right side of the U...Ux.  Here you can pause to reflect, buff up or whatever, before you start your battle. Garrick is lvl 5 and his thugmate is lvl 3.  Both will participate in the fight.  I returned the same way I came without any problems.  Good luck! | Garrick Padfoot is located at (57,48) in Northshire Vineyard. He's a level 5, and will have at least one other level 5 with him. He's next to a little shack, which is next to the mountains. Just kill him and take his head!"

69,58 | Subject: ""How to find Tharil'zun""
Head south across bridge then left at road; dodge the spawn, alternately, swim ESE but there are 25e threshers there, once u get to keep, fight past bridge guards, go behind broken doors, and find two more guards, then a group of three directly across from them and finally the man with three buddies. Each of these mobs can be done without aggroing the other two, but the dying will run for help from these other mobs.

Take a hunter if possible to use human tracking, or a druid in panther mode prowling, much easier to find Tharil.

Just remember he is outside the keep but inside the walls at the SE corner.

When you get the quest ""Find the lost Guards"" swim or walk north along the river. You will get to a point where the river forks and where it forks is a tiny tiny little island (not to be mistaken with the huge island). When you get to the tiny island go to the northern most point of it and turn to the left (west). You should see the small waterfall. Swim past that small waterfall and go onto the main land. You should see a red thingy right in front of you once you get onto the main land, which is the first body you need to get. That will give you the quest to find Rolf's body around the Murlocs. So now go back in the river, swim to the east side of the river and go along until you find the first Murloc camp. If you swim to the end of the first camp, you will see 3 huts together and if you look a little past that, there are 2 huts together further away from the water. Look on the ground, to the right of these two huts and you should another red thingy, which is the second body. | Malakai - 72,60 (Corpse)

Hey thanks for the awesomely useless picture | Subject: ""correct location of the watch""
the correct location of the watch is 49,19 | Coordinate: 49,19

The pocket watch is inside a cupboard that you can interact with. The cupboard itself is inside a small house that has 2 guards. One is a level 12 and another is a level 15 named. They are connected to each other, meaning that if you pull either of them, you will pull both.

Be extra careful especially if you are below level 15. My advice would be to kill the lower level first and then run away and heal up. And then come again to kill the other one. | Subject: ""Coord and hints""
You can find the watch at:
49,19
[If you run on the road south away from the man you took the quest from, keep right.  It's the first farm to your right named Furlbrow's Pumpkin Patch.  You'll see a barn to the left and a house on the right, in front of all that is a large field.  The watch is inside the house, inside a dresser.]

There are two guards inside the building--level 12ish humanoids.

Rewards:
10x Freshly Baked Bread
10x Ice Cold Milk

Turn in (or take) the quest at:
60,19
[Without coords: Running from Elwynn Forest into Westfall, the guy greets you just after the bridge when you first enter Westfall.] | this quest is fairly easy, you can complete it without even killing anything, just go to the outside of the house and find where the pointer turns to gear. you should be able to pick the watch from the outside.(its the right wall as you face the door) | Subject: ""very easy""
you do not have to get in the house to finish the quest. when you're looking at the front door go to the left side of the building. get very close to the wall and you can open the locker through the wall. | Subject: ""cheat?""
You dont actually have to enter the house, just go to the left side of it (Side closest tot he barn) and approach the window. You can target the wardrobe from outside and get the watch"

I was bored and not in a fighting mood so I decided to test the theory that you could get all your Honey Ripple bottles from the crate by the waterfall in 5 trips and 25 minutes (respawn every 5 minutes) as suggested above.

The initial crate and the first respawn produced 1 bottle each plus food. The 3rd and 4th crates produced 3 bottles each plus more food. The 5th crate provided 3 more bottles (for 11 in total) and more food.

However, the average respawn rate of the crate was 10 to 12 minutes, so completing the quest this way will take about 50 minutes .

If your a fisherman this may be your idea of a good time...but you get less exp points in the process (not killing anything) and fewer drops etc...so you'll have to decide if this is the best way to complete this quest. | Relatively straight forward quest.

Here are the corr. 35,46 | I did this quest with my lvl 45 warrior last night - it is doable but you have to be careful. The bugs are lvl 47-50 and although the drop rate is high, it is not 100%. I was getting one drop out of three kills. I was killing lvl 47-48 bugs.

A word of caution:

The lvl 50 bug has a VERY small minion. You can mistake it for one of the critters Blizzard put in the game - it is not. Around the lvl 50 bug, look to the ground. It is very small. You might not even be able to click on it that easily, but it is a minion. Their walkpaths are not that similar either. Those two bugs might be far apart from each other. Do not aggro it since it will bring the big one running. | Subject: ""44""
im a 44 rogue and this quest is damn hard. i can take the lvl 47/48s but if theres more then one i have to vanish fo'sho | to find these Bugs, you go south of the pond where you finished the first part of the quest to the Noxious Lair (36,40 to 32,51 ish)

any of these bugs drops the carapace but it is not 100% drop chance.
i don't exactly remember, but i think the bugs lvls are 45 to 50. | After finishing, you can talk to Fizzledowser on the hill again to start a new quest line, https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=10 | This quest turns yellow really early, if you want to do it as early as you can then the best place is probably the south side of the nest as there are loads of 47-48 centipaar wasps there (the lowest level centipaar). As stated drop rate is fairly ugly so you might be there for a while. | Subject: ""Ugh""
This quest is a bit of a PIA with the drop rate and pesky horde (I'm on Sargeras).

Killed flying mobs up to level 49 with my 45 war with % to crit gear (cragfist armor, rockpounder, some others). The 49s tested me but besides them I never went below 50% on HP, and thats only because my rockpounder is so slow. I worked on the outside of the crater.

Anyway, drop rate is pretty miserable overall, what I notice even more is that it is difficult to get ANYTHING to drop from these guys. Many times I came up empty on drops.

Not sure about the crawlers - I did kill one and got 1 part from it. The rest from flying insects. The only reason I would go for crawlers is because one of them (I forget which) runs back for help. The rest do not.

Go in with rest XP, though, and its excellent grinding material. Overall I got about 12k XP between the quest that starts this one, the mobs, and this ending quest (including rest XP).

Unless your level 50, going in the middle is, to me, a suicide mission. The are pretty tightly packed in there. I suggest starting at the ramp as a camp and pulling back there, then working out from that. | If you dont go to far in and only attack the bugs on the edges you should be able to keep from aggroing to much i finshed as a lv 45 Hunter | Subject: ""XP & Rep""

That he stole the lost necklace

I killed legions of all the swine
For a simple pie
Because it seems when it's almost done
The drops just don't come
For the quest, of the boar, on the ground.

So take my carving knife
Just remember to always look twice.

He told me he dropped the jewelry, down by Fargodeep
A gold-toothed kobold just picked it up and ran down the mine
For the quest, in the mine, underground

Going deeper always scared me
Ever since I was a newb
Don't go around, killing grey mobs' loot.
When I descended in that cavern
To the smell of Kobold puke
I knew what I had to do
To bring the head of Goldtooth back to her..

Billy Maclure has got some trouble
He's just a kid, a kid who has to confess
That he stole the lost necklace
Yes, he's got to confess
That he stole that lost necklace

88,Princess Must Die!,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=88,"Subject: ""Princess""
cords are 69,78 | Subject: ""what a sense of humor...""
...the developers must have to make this such a pain in the butt. First of all, for all you guys above who said ""lol, so easy, soloed with my lvl 13 whatever"", soloing something you are 4 levels above doesn't give you bragging rights, okay? Jeez.
    I imagine that melee classes or pet classes wouldn't have much trouble doing this at the appropriate level; there are 3 mobs but they are all no more than lvl 9. I know as a rogue I could have done this easily.
However, with my mage, this was a pain, and I couldn't solo it until I hit lvl 12, even then I only managed to kill 2 of the mobs and barely managed to outrun the survivor.
So if you're a cloth wearer, take a friend or get some levels.
    Princess does serious damage, breaks Sheep easily, and her ""entourage"" have rogue-like Sprint ability, making it difficult to escape them...more often than not they will run you down and kill you. Sprint-enabled pigs? rofl. seriously.
  I did it by sheeping one of her escorts (as noted, Princess was able to break my Sheep really fast on an earlier try so didn't bother with her), then frost nova, backed up and then unloaded on princess. Then I ran like hell and came back later for the collar. I'm an alchemist, which was useful b/c i needed to use a health potion, the pigs all do pretty high damage and quickly. I found The Collector quest to be an easier solo although it is higher level. Conveniently, they're in the same location, so knock yourself out. | ""She"" is lvl 9, has 2 bodyguards lvl 7, always do this in group.

lots of lvl 18-20 murlocks so if ur a lower lvl watch out..u can probably swim around them but its just a warning | Subject: ""<Blank>""
If you open up your world map, the chest is located at the top of the letter ""L"" in the word Lake.  There are no murlocs if you access it from the south shore of the lake by the bridge guards. | Here's the best way to find the toolbox. First, stand on the bridge leading into Lakeshire. You'll see a patched, wooden part of the bridge*- stand on that and jump off into Lake Everstill below - jumping off the east side of the bridge into the water. Swim east and look underwater - beware of level 18 and 19 murlocs. As you swim east underwater, you'll come to a sunken rowboat. Keep swimming past it to the second sunken rowboat, and you'll see the chest on the bottom of the lake by the second sunken rowboat. So basically, jump east off the Lakeshire bridge and swim east, watching underwater for murlocs and the first then second sunken rowboat, and you'll find the sunken chest that contains Oslow's tools there on the bottom near the second sunken rowboat. Good luck!

*note - the wooden patched section of the Lake Everstill/Lakeshire bridge I am talking about is the small patch that's closest to the south end of the bridge & the Redridge Mountains- not the wide wooden section of the bridge closest to Lakeshire. Right when you're first starting to enter Lakeshire, coming in from Redridge Mountains, that southern end of the bridge has a small little wooden patch on its east side. That's where I'm talking about. | Subject: ""location""
To find the tools, jump straight off the end of the single dock on the east side of the bridge by town. Swim east underwater and you will see the wreckage of a small boat on the bottom of the lake. Continue east to another small boat wreckage by some rocks, the tools will be there inside a Sunken Chest. | Subject: ""Location""
I found the chest right beneath the letter "" L "" on the map beneath the word Lake in ""Lake Everstill"". | Subject: ""Tools""
This quest was easy. I'm L18 Mage. I found the chest at the bottom of the lake near where the letter ""L"" is on the map.

Yes, there are Murloc's around but I found that approaching from the south side of the lake was the easiest way in. There are a few Murloc's around the chest but they are patroling so if you time your entry right you can get in and get the tools and be out before the Murlocs come back into agro range."

For the roleplayers: it's about the children
For some of us: it's about REPUTATION!
-first 3 quests: 50 rep each for all [alliance/horde] factions.
-next 2 quests: 75 rep each for all [alliance/horde] factions.
-final turn in: 200 rep each for all [alliance/horde] factions. (assuming you dont chose the gold bag, which is supposed to decrease your rep)
-------------------------------
Total: 500 reputation with all of your team's factions.

Sure you can get the experience easier somewhere else, but where can you get the rep?  Also can be done prior to level 60 so for a low enough character even the experience can't be gotten easier. | Subject: ""Re: A Warden of the Alliance [171]""
Ok, this quest isn't all that difficult, at least not if you already have the flightpoints. During Children's Week, pick up your orphan from the matron in the Cathedral District of Stormwind. Place the whistle in an action bar and pull him out only when completing another leg of the quest, otherwise keep him tucked away. Fly from SW to Sentinel Hill and ride out to the lighthouse on an island just off of the beach. (Past Moonbrook. Same place you encountered the ghost captain many levels ago. Beyond Sark and Old Murk-Eye.) Pull your orphan out AFTER it tells you the quest is complete. (He doesn't need to be out to complete these SW orphan quests... tho he will have to be out for at least one leg of the Shatt orphan quests which are not related.) Talk to your orphan to finish it off and tuck him away again. Ride back to the bird in Sentinel and fly to Lock Modan. I believe the town is called Telenaar. (I'd ck and make certain but the server is down right now. Forgive the mispellings of these place-names.) Ride out due north from Telenaar to the Dam on the northern end of the lake. Then ride to the middle of the dam and complete that leg of the quest. Return to the bird in Telenaar and fly to Menethil Harbor. Take the boat from there to Auberdine. Make certain to take the correct boat, there are two. At Auberdine, take another boat to Rut'theran Village and go through the portal there to Darnassus. Take the boy to the bank, which is near the portal, so he can see the tree. Talk to him and he'll give you the next two quests (you've already completed three now). Fly to Theramore or reverse your steps and take the boat from Menethil Harbor to Theramore. (I recommend flying there from Darn. Sure it takes 10-12 minutes, but less work. Go make yourself a nice cup of tea.) Enter the castle in Theramore and go all the way to the top to get the autorgraph of Lady Proudmore for the young lad. Fly to Gadgetztan. Ride out from Gadget to the racetrack north of Gadget and buy him an icecream cone. (You acutally have to buy 5. Only way they come.) The guy who sells the icecream is hard to find. Keep looking. He's behind a building, but definitely outside, not inside. Then you take the young fellow back to the matron in SW and choose your reward. Pig, Turtle, and Rat pets are your choices (and a sack of 5g for those who don't want a pet). They all have their own unique traits... except the gold, it just sits thre. Go with your instincts on the reward. | Subject: ""Speedy FTW!""

Think again.

If you take the bag of gold you can never EVER get one of the pets anymore on that character.
They are unique pets and even have names.
You can always get 5 gold, but you can get this pet only once, so you're crazy to take the gold.

Maybe if it was 100g, you could take it in consideration.... But 5g is really a rip-off compared to a unique pet. | Subject: ""Re: A Warden of the Alliance [171]""

The lieutenant can be found by leaving town to the north and bearing right when you can (you will start back downhill and pass an empty mill). Bear left along the cliffbase until you start seeing gnolls. Fangore spawns just past the middle of the clearing (you can see a little valley off to the left leading to a cave... just past there). It seemed easiest to just cut thru the middle along the path... only had more than 1 add once (watch out for a group of 3 wanderers). Try to make your way back to the left cliff face where there are some safe spots. As a level 25 I could pick off 3 or 4 of the outer gnolls but could never pull Fangore without fewer than 3 of his buddies. I died maybe once figuring my way around and another 3 times getting swamped. The last time Fangore went down before I did and since our corpses were in a safe spot I had no trouble looting the paw after I got my body back. In retrospect I should have planned on dying from the start and led off with my pet attack rather than trying to get single pulls with my bow and getting the agro on me right away. 2250 exp iirc.
b | Subject: ""Dont try and pull Fangore""
Was doin this with me, a 25 druid, and a 24 warrior. Pulling fangore individually dosnt work. We tried to pull him when he was a good distance away from his 2 escorts (a good 15 yards) but they still rushed to defend him. Im not sure if fangore is aggro linked to his escorts, but his 2 escorts are definately linked to him.

So if u wanna solo him your best hope would be to take out his ecorts first.
Thanx for reading my comment.

Moonwind 25 Night Elf Druid on Crushridge | Subject: ""Going solo""
If you are going to do this quest solo, you should first pick off the 3-4 mobs in the vicinity of Fangore (I approached in stealth mode and positioned myself by the hills behind him).  That will leave you with Fangore and 3 mobs that are close to him, one of which wanders. Pick off the one wanderer too.  You'll then have to kill Fangore along with the two remaining mobs.  When Fangore gets close to death he will run off and come back with another mob so make sure you kill him before he does this.  My level 28 druid died while doing this but not before I successfully killed and looted him. | Fangore is not especially hard with a pal or two. You don't _need_ a full party however it makes it much easier. The biggest concern you'll have is moving through that region and handling the many wandering mobs that will join in."

PS: Just before i finish, DO NOT go inside the ruins u see, there is a mob of lvl 35 commando's inside, i just found out the hard way.

PPS: right so now i know what you mean, that the medicine man heals the jungle fighter, i will try to separate them to avoid them being rezzed. will let ya know if it worked.

There are at least three troll hangouts. They form a sort of triangular region in the central part of SV, east of the road.

1. the Ziata'jai Ruins (42,35) are along the road, to the east (right) of the road, between the Arena to the south and Lake to the north.  Here, the road runs almost straight and almost due north-south.  There is a Temple icon for these ruins on the Map.  This place is mostly populated with lvl 39-40 Axe Thrower and HeadSplitters.  I found only a couple Mystics or WDs nearby.

2. the Ruins of Zul'Mamwe (46,41) lies to the SE of Ziata'jai.  There is a Temple icon on the map for this location too.  As I hunter, I used Humanoids tracking to 'scout' the area and found near zero Mystics or WDs, but saw large groupings of Warriors and others.   

3. The most promising spot I found is north and east of Ziata'Jai in the Balia'Mah Ruins (43,41).  The are about where the letter 'o' in ogre for the Mosh'Ogg Ogre Mound appears on the map.  I found good numbers of Mystics around here.

It's worth noting that there are patrols, usually 3 of mixed types, patrolling the paths between these three sites.  You are warned.

I definitely found that most Troll types were dropping Tusks (for the other quest).  But, the Fetishes are only found on the WDs and Mystics

Overall, I found the drop rate to be okay.  :-|

This is a small straightfoward guide that doesn't use locs.

---
There are 4 tablets. These are interactable objects on the ground in the troll ruins. You get a gear when you pass over them even through walls so you will be able to tell when you're close.
- #1 is in Bal'lal Ruins which are just east of the basalisks on the coast and south of Zul'Kunda. The tablet is in the southwest corner of thse ruins. The easiest way here is just to clear your way to it as best you can.

- #2 is in the Vile Reef, filled with elite murlocks. Scary huh! Well, it's almost due west of Bal'lal. Swim out until you see a ruin. It'll be on the north edge of the northeast corner on the outside. Swim down from the outer edge and no murlocs will even notice you.

The 3rd & 4th Tablets are in the Ruins of Zul'Kunda in the northwest most corner of STV.

- #3 you can reach by going to the beach on the west side of the ruins and going up a path in the back. It is in the corner behind a wall from that angle. Going in through the front, it is in the SW most corner of Zul'Kunda. There are alot of closely-packed mobs near it so unless you're a powerhouse I'd bring friends.

- #4 is on the north side of Zul'Kunda. It is the hardest part to reach. I did it by clearing my way down the middle of the ruins, where it makes something like a road. You will reach a hairpin turn. Get up onto the divider and clear the mobs at the top of the second path where you're walking back towards the front of the ruins. After those are dead, you can walk along the top of the wall (northward) and get singles if you're careful. Walk to the end of this wall towards a pool and the 4th tablet is right at the corner of the wall and this pool.

I hope that helps people who don't like to use locs. | You can solo all of these if you're careful. I did it on my lvl 37 warrior.

The first two are easily done. With some thought you won't have any trouble at all.

The third one is the hardest to solo in my opinion. There are a lot of closely packed mobs around it (it's at the soutwest corner of the Zul'Kunda ruins, btw). Approaching from the south I was able to clear a path to the legend with some delicate pulls. Just take your time and don't be afraid to run off if you aggro too many mobs.

#4 can be gotten pretty easily if you know where to sneak. As you go into the Zul'kunda ruins from the east, go up the big hill to the right of the main entrance. Follow that hill north until it gets close enough to let you jump onto (not over) the outer wall. Hop on that wall and follow it all the way north. Then follow the wall west to the upper level of the waterfall. To your left you should see the legend. Pull the mobs closest to it carefull and you'll get it no problem. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
These aren't drops, lest there be confusion.  There are big stone tablets leaning up against the walls in the ruins, that you can interact with.  You right-click on 'em, and it gives you a loot box, and voila! :) | Subject: ""Solo at 33""
Soloed with a 33 Hunter. WooHoo! People who say this is tedious are wrong. It's a challenge and fun. The only really tricky tablets were the two in Zul'Kunda:

For all you Cosmos-haters (like me!):

One of tablets is at the southwest corner of Zul'Kunda. At this corner there is a fort, then just north of that is another fort. It is in this fort at its northwest corner where you find the tablet. You can take the mobs 1 or 2 at a time if you're patient and keep your eyes open.

The second one is tougher. You can approach the east entrance to Zul'Kunda, but don't go inside. Instead, climb up the hills and walk north along the wall until you reach the steep slopes. From here, you should be able to see a small water fall inside the ruin.

Get close to the wall and you will aggro 1-2 mobs  through the wall who will somehow chase you onto the hills. Kill them (of course). Then, you can run up the steep slope near the wall and if you time it right, jump onto the wall. From there you can walk west along a very narrow ledge over the water to the waterfall (as stated above - good post). The tablet is right next to the waterfall guarded by several mobs.

If you have a pet :), send them into the mobs and loot the tablet at your liesure.

Track Humanoids, Eagle Eye, and Feign Death were awesome for this mission. | Subject: ""horrible horrible quest""
i had a horrific time with this quest no thanks in part to the terrible directions listed on the preveious posts for the third tablet.

-- Finding 1st and 2nd are straightforward enough.

-- For the 3rd, it took me forever to find because using the coordiantes 22,11 and 22,12 is useless because they are just WAYYYYYYYY too broad and covers too much area to help. The easiest way to find the tablet is to climb the ridges on the southwestern part of the ruins (22,14), which leads to a small plateau with 3 trolls, then walk up a dirt road. It will rise quickly and lead you into a square walled encampment similar to the 1st tablet. Inside is the 3rd tablet.

-- For the 4th, just follow the wall trick instructions above.

This quest is a nightmare. AVOID if you havent started it yet.

Hope this saves someone the hour or two i wasted on this POS quest.

Coords from somebody above. Make it better story. :)
1st: 29,19 -> in Bal'lal Ruins
From east side, you can see tablet in the NW corner of the building.
You pull only mobs which is in you way. The one mob which is a bit near stone, you can mind soothe him.
First loot.

2nd:  25,23 -> Vile Reef, inside water. Swim until you see blue glowish stone below. Swim a bit more north, look behind the wall, outside the temple. You see tablet against the north wall. Swim carefully near tablet, so elite mobs don't aggro. Easy second loot.

3rd:  22,13 -> First part in Ruins of Zul'Kunda. Starts from west side/coast. Walk with care up the hill, turn immediately to left to west wall. You kill first mobs. Now walk a bit further against the wall (the stone is behind the wall). You shall cause first aggro. Walk now a bit back so you can see both mobs. Kill them. Now clean the area a bit and you can loot third loot.

4th:  24,8 -> You need here more trick. Leave the Ruins, and starts now from east side of same Ruins place (you walk around). Go climb up the hills you see at right side, starting near the entrance. Go to the fartest place where you can jump on the wall. Now walk more to right/north until you stick against another wall. You see a small path in the wall. Walk carefully to west. Go to the waterfall part you see there. Walk over the waterfall-wall. You see the table at other side. You must pull two mobs before you can loot. 4th loot!

Now you have all stones. Your choice: fight, walk back to small wall path, or heartstone to near place (Stormwind of Booty Bay). I can fight through the many mobs, but it's not easy. Remember they can drop a bit mageweave cloth. | You must complete Bad Medicine and The Second Rebellion first. | 2020

All you really want to know is about the Second one, out in the reef, that looks like its guarded by the elite Murlocs.

There is a tablet on BOTH sides of its location by the ruin wall.
Go to the one on the 'outside', opposite side of the Murlocs.

Worst.  Drop.  Rate.  Ever.

Not as frustrating as trying to collect things like ears and heads that rarely drop, which I'm pretty sure every mob one kills possesses

(Yeah, I know they all have tusks, but one can picture needing a certain ""quality"" of tusk to count as a quest item.)

(late edit below...)

All sarcasm aside...

I, too, found that the ""Ruins of Zul'Mamwe"" area was the best drop rate.  The drop rate is actually pretty darn good IF you concentrate on the WARRIORS, MYSTICS, and WITCH DOCTORS *inside* the gate and/or very near the ""main"" north-eastish gate.

The drop rate is *miserable* for HUNTERS, SCOUTS, and AXE THROWERS.

What sucks about the way the mobs spawn in this particular area is that, unlike other areas, if you kill, say, a WARRIOR at a given spawn point, at respawn, it may very well pop up as something else seemingly random (i.e. a HUNTER).  So, after a short time of picking out all the warriors, mystics, and witch doctors - leaving others alone - I found them to get rarer and rarer (sheer probability dictates this).  Your best situation is to be doing this quest while others are grinding in the area on the mobs with crap drops.  If you can find some moron killing hunters and such, you'll benefit.  (Or be a prick in a PUG doing this quest...try to make sure your mob when it's your turn in Group Loot is always one of the good ones...lol).

Concentrating on those particular mob types yielded a drop rate of 80%.

Obviously, lower level toons will not have the option of picking and choosing - especially with all of the patrols.  I was L47 when I did this (hey, still full XP/rep), so aggro was minimal.

I don't know if it was a recent patch, but it seems the concept of abandoning the quest and handing in the quest item is no longer valid.

I started the quest, ignoring the time, got the meat and returned to Stormwind. After I abandoned the quest, I found the quest item in my inventory missing.

As much as I’ve traveled that road in STV I never noticed the cold eye basilisks before.  For clarification, they are just north of Gurubashi arena on the road.

Traveling from booty Bay, just after you exit the arena on the road, you will see a basilisks on the right (wrong kind) and perhaps a tiger on the left. The next critter up the road will be your cold eye basilisks.
Without using my recalls I flew from SW to Booty Bay (6.5 minutes), road my mount and returned the same way. Completed the quest in 20 minutes (+ or – a few). 4700 xp at level 40.
Fun little quest. | So in Classic, the quest item disappear if you abandon the quest. BUT, you can retake the quest if it's failed, without abandoning it, and that way the quest item will still be in the inventory, and you can hand it in."

This quest is very easy. I completed it with my level 4 mage. I accidently stumbled across an easier way to complete it. As soon as you enter the cave, if you take the path to the right instead of the left, you will eventually come to a cliff. The level 5 guy is right below you, you are standing right above him. Don't bother trying to attack him from the cliff, i tried and every single shot was evaded. But if you jump down, you only have to fight him and 1 other troll. Focus on the level 5 first, and once he dies the other troll is easy to finish. My mage only had 87 health to begin with, i think i had a little under 20 health when i was done. Was very easy, make sure you have full health/mana before and after you do it. And then after just work your way to the exit, killing the trolls 1 by 1. Take the right side out to exit also.

This can be done at the same time as the ""Blackrock Bounty"" quest.

It's possible to pull the groups to him instead of waiting for him to blunder into them, cutting the fight to only 3 or 4 mobs at once.

it doesn't feel right that as a paladin, you have to go out and get the supplies to give to someone so you can get a cool hammer. When you could do this quest and get a cool sword while doing a good deed (though to start off the paladin quest, you save someone's life and farm. But still)

The weapons you get from both arn't too far off damage wise, and this has a cool proc (which as a SoC paladin, I like more than stats). The Hammer has 4 more max damage (same min) and is .1 faster than archeus, and it has 6 stam and some intelect (7?).

I don't know the level on the hammer, but I know the level on archeus is 35, meening you can enchant it with the new enchants that can be gotten from BC.

Re: Above comment by me.

So I redid this as a lvl42.

To get another power source, after wasting the first one, I had to go out and collect ten water pouches.

After 1 hour and 15 minutes hunting between Gadgetzan and Steamwheedle Port I had 8 acceptable hyena and scorpid samples, but only 2 basilisk samples. To finish the basi samples I went Southwest out of Gadgetzan, only a little ways and killed several. I had all samples by 1h 45m.

I'm no fan of low drop rate collection quests, but they seem to pay a lot. When I turned in the power source in Gadgetzan, I received 4050 xp. When I turned in the kit in the Apothecarium in the Undercity, I recieved 5050 xp, 1g 30s, and an item which sold to the vendor for 65s 10c.

That's 9100 xp and almost 2g all totalled.

If you are standing at the inn and looking out, it would be about 45 degrees to your right. Your mouse will change and you should get a tooltip of ""Yuriv's Tombstone"". | Subject: ""How To Do It""
Walk over to the tomb that has a carving of a man lying on his back with candles all around him. Click on the tomb to open it as if it was a box, DO NOT TRY TO USE THE PENDANT TO DO ANYTHING, IT WILL ACHIEVE NOTHING!
Once you've opened the tomb the rest is just basic. | exact cords 44,42 | Subject: ""i agree with wowholic""
For soem weird reason this has been one of my favorite quests yet. Really slow down and read the text at the end. Very cool.

Best way to get here is take a bat from UC then head to the main Sepulcher building. Grave is on your left."

I found at 52,69 i was able to attack the 3 men standing by Miran and Saean, and then at 63,66 I was ambushed by two others, all lvl 10. | Subject: ""Quest""
These guys are down at the south end of the lake that is just east of Town. When you get there, the ambush will go on and then you fight the dark irons off.

Then, and be quick about this, talk to Huldar and Miran. If you take too long and someone else is there, chances are Miran is going to get started up the way with them. When I got there, there was a line of folks waiting to escort him.

Miran will walk almost all the way up to the site, then get attacked by more irons. At least two pop, maybe 1 plus 1 for each person walking him, but as I did it alone it was no problem. I just sheeped the one that Miran didnt attack and we went at it.

If you dont catch him in time, or he isnt at the wagon when you get htere, dont worry. He walks up to the prospector, then despawns and reappears at the wagon again. So if he's not there, then just wait and he will be shortly. | Subject: ""Yeah :)""
I alos found them at the location 52,69 | Sorry to ruin the surprise, but if you're reading this you likely won't mind. As you approach the supply cart, you'll be surprised to find Saean begin attacking Miran with two other dwarves that appear. Jump in and save him!

The ambush starts when you get within proximity (not when you talk to anyone). Make sure you're healed up and ready to deal damage prior to approaching the cart. Otherwise this isn't very hard."

Looking at this from somewhat of an RP perspective (I'm on Silver Hand), the end rewards are disappointing. If any class is going to help 'preserve the balance', it'll be druids and hunters, yet the items doled out from this end quest are almost entirely useless to either class.

Admittedly, the xp reward is pretty nice.

The crate is at the first village (where you killed merlocs nearest the road). The barrel is at the 3rd (of 4) villiages as you proceed up the coast. The 4th villiage is full of the warriors and oracles. Be wary if you want to kill there as they are tightly packed and higher level w/ healers.

--Getting There--
Walk the long way to the middle of Iceflow lake (33,42) and kill all normal animals you may encounter. Once you arrive at the Camp Brewnall Village (29,46) Head south West to the cave ""FrostMane Hold"" (24,50).

--Part 1 (Kill all 5)--
When you start see see trolls slowly pull the outside defenders 1 by 1 and then make it to the cave. just keep pulling them and killing them untill all 5 are slain.

--Part 2--
For this i reccomend if you have any items or food that will increace stamina use them now. SImply kill the forst 3-4 in the cave so its safe (carefull not to get mobbed by 2) and then run as fast as possible to the end of the entrace passage. Jump down from there onto the ice and run around that snow/ice mound in the middle and it SHOULD say (Quest Frostmne Hold - Area Discorver) or something and then you will probably die but that doesnt matter because you are under 9 simply talk to the Spirit Healer and walk the 30 feet to the quest hand in and theres 750 exp.

First mate Snellig is located on the first ship nearest the shore.  He spawns just inside the hole on the east side of the ship by the shoreline. | Subject: ""Cursed""
The box drops from First Mate Snellig. He's in bottom of first ship. | As with most of the quests that have underwater fighting, it's very easy to get overwhelmed by adds when you're swimming around in the ships. The easiest way to clear is to sit just outside the ship's opening and pull them one/two at a time. I saw a poor mage swim into the bottom floor of the boat and get mauled by like six mobs.... | There's a hole in the side of the ship towards the shore - Snellig and another sailor or two are in here. If you walk in off the shore, you'll aggro them and they'll chase you. Kill Snellig and get the snuff box.

The mobs here are on a pretty quick respawn - killing enough sailors is easy enough if you pull one at a time. Killing the marines are harder, as they're inside the ship, more chance of getting overwhelmed.

Soloed this as a Lvl 26 hunter, tanking with the pet (who kept getting turned into a ghost humanoid with a curse!)

To get the rest of the mobs after Snellig, there's a breach in the stern of the ship (above water) where you can swim up and take the sailors one at a time if you're carefull... | Subject: ""not easy, not too hard""
I wouldnt say this quest is easy, but it's doable, as a lowbie, if your smart about it. Solo'd as a 26 Dranei priest, killed a few of the surrounding mobs off first, then when i aggroed him, it was only him + 1 other mob, shackled the other mob, pained him, and went to town, he didnt hit too hard, just kept buffs on, and made sure to regen/heal w/e needed."
290,Lifting the Curse,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=290,"Subject: ""Location""
Both captain and lockbox are on the same ship.  It's the ship to the north (not the one against the shore).
Capt. is on upper aft deck (above water) and only a few mobs protect him.
Lockbox is bottom of ship toward the front.  There's a hole broken open in the side of the ship (underwater).  You can enter through that hole to get lockbox.  Lockbox is protected by many Cursed Marines. | To kill the Captain, just climb up the rudder. Kill him and loot the corpse. Then swim around to the bottom on the west side to get to the box. | The box is in bottom of the northern ship. You can get there by west side of the ship. 14, 24 | Subject: ""Insanely Easy!""
This quest was wonderfully easy -- now, I will say I had the advantage because I am a druid so I used prowl to get inside the bottom of the boat... but lemme explain regardless.

First of all, coords for the ship are 14,24. The Captain is on the top floor on the right side. Go to the east side of the ship and there's a plank-type thing you can easily walk up. I didn't even prowl up there. Pulled him with Insect Swarm and he came alone. Fought him right there on the plank. Simple as pie!

Next, you need to get to the very bottom of the ship (underwater, mind you) to open the lock box. Go to the north side of the ship (swim around) and at the bottom you'll see a hole in the side of the ship. That's where you need to enter. Facing in that direction, the lockbox will be on the right, but pretty much right in front of you. To the left are two cursed marines.

If you have stealth, hang a right. You can then unstealth and carefully inch your way to the lockbox and open it without aggroing ANYONE. Then restealth and swim back out and you're home free.

If you don't have stealth, you can easily grab that first sailor. I highly doubt the second will aggro, although I have not tested this. Even if the second one does aggro, you're only facing two mobs. Hope this helps. :D | The chest in at the bottom of the boat the Captain is on. Its a bit tricky to get there through the boat. The easiest way is through a hold underwater on the bottom side of the boat. It is the northern most boat. | Subject: ""Some basic info""
The captain is a level 30 mob, and spawns above the hold in the eastern part of the ship. With 2-3 people a very easy kill. You can fight here withough being under water, which is nice.

After killing the captain you need to clear to the front of the ships hold to get to the chest. This is done by dropping through the hole in the deck in teh captain's room (among other access points).

We did this by pulling the mobs 1-2 at a time back to the captains room, so we could kill them there without worrying about breath issues. Once most of the route to the chest was cleared we moved to the chest, killed the last two mobs, and all looted. | Subject: ""Picture and Location""
Approach from (14, 23), which is the southwestern side of the ship.  Swim all the way to the bottom and look through the gaping hole in the ship's side and see it:

http://i2.tinypic.com/ve5bfb.jpg

Carefully pull and kill marines/sailors and then retreive the lockbox. | Subject: ""Solo tips""
First of all you NEED the quest scrolling mod. The one that makes the quest text appear instantly. With that, no matter what class you are, you can do it.

The person you need to kill to get the key off of it on the Northern boat on the Northern side. He is level 30 but you can pull him on his own (if you walk up the plank of wood on the North side). Kill him using whatever cooldowns or items you need.

The lockbox you have to open with the key is on the same ship. Swim below the surface to the bottom (so you are touchig the ground). On the Western side of that boat, all the way to the bottom, a small chunk of the boat is missing. This is a convineant hole which you can see the lockbox through. There are far too many enemies surrounding it to kill (you may not see them because they are tranparant) but you can still do it.

Check your breath (don't want to drown). Swim in the hole (try not to get stuck on it) and get the lockbox, quickly. THE LOCKBOX DOESN'T NEED TO BE OPENED. It doesn;t matter that 10 or so level 27s are smacking away at you, you wont get interupted (as there is nothing to interupt). Just right click the lockbox and keep hitting continue, complete quest or accept. When you have accepted the quest, die outside the boat (so you can ressurect).

Edit: I'll just note that I did this easily as a 27 druid without stealthing. | Subject: ""The Box""
The Box is 14.25 (Wetlands) in the boat.
(Under the boat) | Subject: ""ERm... I did it as a warlock w/o stealth really easy.""
Walk up the tiller thing in the back. Gank the Captain.

Go to the side of the boat... agro the two. Kill them. Inch your way into the boat untill you are JUST close enough to loot it. And do so.

And you're done."

The path that leads up to the tribe of Seers is at 37,42, directly east of the lake beside a small cave.
Hope this helps | Subject: ""Hard for beginner lvl9 hunter""
I think this one is too hard for a hunter on his own. When you shoot the first target you get chased by two or three Frostmane Trolls who shoot at you with magic and try to chop you up. The path approaching the camp is narrow, so there is no room to move about for a hunter, nor an opportunity to attack from a different angle.

I spent hours looking for these trolls (I even explored in the far east of Dun Murogh, for the stupid sap I am. It says ""high up in the hills to the east"" after all :-P). Then the tips here brought me closer, but still no luck. It turns out the path leading up to the troll camp is directly to the left (=north) of the cave entrance where the bears prowl around. Watch for the torches sticking in the ground. The bear cave is, as mentioned, to the east of the Iceflow lake.

There are actually two camps. The first can be found by following the path straight up. The second is nearby. Take a left turn somewhere at the top of the path and cross the suspension bridge.

the wreckage is directly to the south of menethil harbor (exact coordinates are 12. 64), you dont have to go out of the town, one ingot is in a chest on the ship, the others ones you have to get on the murloc's around the area (either underwater or in thier camps)

as for the debate on whether the drops are more common when you are near the ship, im not sure. all i know is that i was killing murloc raiders in baradin bay (the area directly west/left of the ship) and they were still dropping the lightforge ingots | The chest is on the small island in the middle of the boat just south-east of the inn of Menethil.

Ok the first part of the quest you go straight south out of menethial by the gryphon
You will see on you map and mini-map what looks like an island. It is an island and it has a ship broken over it. In the middle of the ship is a grass hill. On that hill are a number of boxes. One small box will turn your cursor into the gear wheel which mean s you can pick something up.
You will in all likey hood have to fight a couple of 29 murlocs. On the boat. Once you complete the quest another quest pops up for getting five more bars. You can do this quest. The drop rate is poor so figure you will kill about 12-14 murlocs for your 5 bars. It should be good XP anyway. All the murlocs in the water drop them.

I'd suggest you do this quest in a group (preferably with friends or people who arent on the quest - so you will get all quest items :P) to end it as soon as possible.

I love how blizzard puts these kinds of quests in just to mess with us. I also love the sence of humor they have with their quest systems...unlike other games, wow is very enjoyable; despite oftentimes being hard. If you wanna complain about these quests, that obviously means youve tried them a few times, which makes the game even better. If all quests were easy and predictible lvling would be sooooo boring. To enjoy the chicken fully:

1.If your chicken won't prompt( start moving) its probably because someone else is doing the quest, not because blizzard is dumb >.<

2 stay a good distance behind your target chicken, if there's a single mob that starts running after the chick, it will evade, however if you catch aggro....the chicken will ignore you as well!

3. Have lots of pots and bandages, the spawned mobs are not random and are always in the escorts usually in groups of 3. You cant heal your chicken but you can heal yourself!

argh i am getting angry reading $%^&..... why havent anyone put any cords yet?

the guy is in lock modan (24.18)

im getting angry using so much time to just understand this. | Subject: ""Finding this guy""
This is a fun quest. I completed this as a level 11 human Pally. I took the tram to Ironforge and then ran from there. There are a couple of gather quests you can pick up and even complete on the way (turning in on the way back). I also found a lot of opporunity to mine, since the road takes you through mountain passes.

Now, I was pretty stupid about this...I thought Loch Modan was a region in the same zone Ironforge was in. There is a big lake right up in the corner of the zone and the signs from Ironforge on point that way. What is worse, when I got into the mountains, the little gold indicator showed up and gave the quest NPC's name. I went through the gate into Loch Modan and it disappeared...so I tried and tried to climb up into the mountains to find him. What is worse, the quest said he is in a tower and there is a tower up in those mountains that you cannot get to.

I had gone through the north gate pas...and I ran to the outpost right inside Loch Modan to sell a bunch of stuff, because I was killing everything I ran accross the whole time...I was pissed that I was not able to get up into the mtns to where the indicator was. I went upstairs in the outpost and there he was standing with a question mark over his head! Sheesh.

So, when you get to a fork in the road from ironforge...the Loch Modan signs actually point to the south, but you should take the north. You will pass through a gate (tunnel) and then through another areea with an outpost and to another gate (again a tunnel). Just through the tunnel and to the left ther eis an outpost...Mountaineer Stormpike is upstairs in that outpost. | Subject: ""Um.. ok.""
Ok, here is the real deal.

1. Get the quest. If you haven't gotten it already, why are you looking it up?

2. Head to Stormwind and take the tram. The tram is located in a tunnel in the Dwarven district.

3. Head out of Ironforge via the only gate, and head along the path EAST. Eventually, and I do mean *eventually*, you'll end up where you can't go straight any more. There is a signpost there. Ignore it and go north.

4. Head through the tunnel, you'll be at North Gate Outpost. Keep going north. You'll reach another tunnel.

5. Now you'll be at Algaz Station. See the round structure there? Go inside. The bleepard is on the top floor.

He has a quest for Stormwind. Accept it, hearthy back home, and you're ready to rock. Assuming you set your Hearth in Stormwind of course."

This means that, if anyone has done the Onyxia questline recently (and if you are on a busy server, that questline is essentially being chain-completed), you need a window of close-to-60 minutes to pass with nobody doing that quest, just so you can hand THIS quest in.

Stupid. Incredibly, insultingly stupid.

To the person who talked to the GM:

The king has not moved location.

He is the Missing Diplomat, trapped on Altraz Island. His son is now king.

Since the son is now king, Lady Katrana speaks for him. | I ran through this line (still need the duskwood and redridge parts), but want to put a little clarity here.

The quest tells you to speak to ""King Varian Wrynn"". A search here for that King does not find you anything.

When you get to the court, you are questioned marked by ""Lady Katrana Prestor"", which is the NPC you need to speak to for this quest. She tells you that the King is away on ""...a diplomatic mission..."".

She gives you the ring, 3750 XP, and 500 (non human) Rep points with Stormwind. | Subject: ""Turning in the Quest""
The Onyxia quest must have recently started if you can't turn the quest into Lady Katrana.  Wait a few hours or an hour after Onyxia is defeated and you can turn it in easy. | The ultimate reward for this quest chain is  Seal of Wrynn, an incredible twinking or levelling ring. The entire chain rewards a ton of XP and has you visiting multiple instances and zones. Twinks would be best to commence this long chain as soon as is practicable, at level 16, and of course you'll need some buddies to carry you.

I disagree with the previous poster.  I completed this quest series at level 24.  I had help along the way, but that's how you maximize your quest rewards.  Not only did I get a ring that is somewhat helpful to me as a caster (gnome/mage), but I got 3750 XP, which bumped me to level 25.  All in all, I thought it was a very long, but rewarding quest chain.

I do wish that Thottbot would get the quests from ""The Attack!"" to ""An Audience with the King"" appended to the nine-step Defias/Van Cleef quest chain.  They are all part of the same series. | Can't turn this in if someone has Onyxia attunement quest active which summons Onyxia right in the middle of that room."

I was lucky enough to complete it without failing, but for others here are some tips on what you could do while wait for this horribly long quest to finish.

1. Take a few steps left or right, and move back again.

415,Rejold's New Brew,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=415,"Subject: ""Thottbot's quest data is incorrect.""
This quest is in the retail release, I just completed it. The trick is that it's only available after you finish The Perfect Stout. The problem is that the quest giver for Rejold's New Brew is Tharek Blackstone, who's in Kharanos. The other problem is that right after you complete The Perfect Stout in Brewnall Village, you are asked to do Shimmer Stout.

Rejold's New Brew directly leads to Shimmer Stout, so if you accept Shimmer Stout upon completing The Perfect Stout (as presumably most people do) you won't be offered Rejold's New Brew.

So, if you really want to do Rejold's New Brew, you must do the following:

1. Complete The Perfect Stout in Brewnall Village.

2. Decline the offer to start Shimmering Stout (in Brewnall Village).

3. Head to Kharanos and talk to Tharek Blackstone. He's right outside of the blacksmithing building.

Tharek will offer you Rejold's New Brew, then you can head back to Brewnall Village whereupon Rejold's New Brew will lead automatically to Shimmering Stout."

This took a while with my 21 mage because I kept getting jumped by multiple guys when I made my way in to the grunts.  Then I'd have to run/blink out and have to kill most of the scouts to get back in which took time.  I figured out if you are facing the camp to the right you can go up on the side of the hill (just time the scout movements so you can stay far enough away from them), then cross the big fallen tree to the left side and get to the grunts by staying up on the left side of the hill away from the scouts.  It's kind of a back door approach that got me the last of the grunts.  Just try to pull them up the hill one by one.  Unfortunately for some reason I got to the harbor and didn't satisfy the traverse part of the quest so no clue what happened there. | 50,80 in between the tunnels"

There's a rare spawn 22 elite gnoll on the castle grounds. I've only seen him once.

If you want another way in (maybe a little easier), there's an opening in the wall at the back of the castle. There are a couple of vile fins, then you're able to sneak in the back of the castle.

The grave is inside the castle keep. If you enter through the main entrance, bear right, between the keep and the inn-like building, and bear right and you should see the grave back there. I think the grave has boots sticking out of it.

The shelf is hard to find but with a little exploration it is possible. Enter the keep and fight your way to the back where the stairs lead up to the second floor. Turn left immediately after going up the stairs, go the the hallway in front of you, kill any mobs near you, and turn left again. In front of you should be a doorway with maybe one or two mobs in there as well. Kill the mobs and enter the room. You are now in the North East tower. There should be a set of stairs in the room follow them up to the top killing any mobs you come in contact with. When the stairs end exit the tower through the doorway and you will now be on the roof. Cross the roof to the other side (west) and kill any mobs near the enterance to the South West tower. Enter the tower through the doorway, again killing any mobs, and directly to the left of the doorway (as you enter it) is the dusty shelf.

I'm always overwhelmed with quests when I usually take my alts to the wetlandshere's a list of what you should do first so you're not running around all the time:

pick up all the one's you can (best to start at about lvl 22/23 here)

Young wetland crock skins
(right of road as you go into the wetlands) and
claws from the deep
(to the left of the road you'll see a broken dock they are in camps there the first one close to the road is the area gobbler usually walks through)
insearch of the excavation
(it's to the right after two small ponds of water you'll past raptors. go to the left once you get into it up the ramp careful of the two mollted raptors pick up the omer's revenge quest too)

go back down outside the site to kill the red and white raptors kill some dont need to kill all 10 yet, return to turn in other quests. pick up new ones repair sell

kill the rest of the raptors you need go turn it in at the top and pickup the next raptors quest for the ones in the site, green and white raptors.

you should of picked up a quest in town called the greenwarden when heading out of town east about 4 inches on your map you'll hit a fork in the road take the right one behind a rock formation is the green warden accept his quest. the mobs you need are further south of the road on the same side as the warden was. turn it in and then do ooze and the 2nd part of this chain.

kill the ooze for the digging through the ooze quest they are back up the fork in the road go north they are on the left side.

when done continue past through highland raptors to the coast edge to kill giant crocks for their skins they are bt the sunken ship and the raptors area, the spawn is bad though about 6 at one time

finally turn all taht in when done and go back to kill the sailors in the sucken ship and the raptor lvl 29 at the dig site

this a breif idea of what to do you're welcome to do your quest as you please just trying to help though so enjoy ^^

464,War Banners,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=464,"The banners are dropped by the Dragonmaw Orcs at Angerfang Encampment, due east of Whelgar's Excavation Site. The entrance to the camp is around 42, 41. Be cautious while fighting there, because, although the mobs are reasonably spaced out, the Raiders have a tendency to net you and then run for help when they get low on health. Overall, not a bad quest. Good drop rate, nothing too tough to solo. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
Orc Camp tloc 43,43 | Subject: ""Orcs are a PITA""
These dragonmaw orcs are a PITA to kill. They are levels 26-27, they spawn like rabbits in heat, there are a lot of roamers, they root you with their ""Net"" spell, they dual wield like dervishes (i.e., fast), they run early (like at 20% life) and they run FAST. Worst of all is the drop rate on the banners - I killed 45-plus orcs to get the 8 banners.

My experience is from doing the quest as a 27 druid, your experience may be different; I saw a 25 hunter and a 32 paladin doing pretty well here. A druid can break their roots by shapechanging, but that takes mana, and they will root you 2-3 times a fight in the worst case. Its good to have a ranged attack like spells, a bow, a gun or a pet to kill them fast when they run.

480,The Weaver,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=480,"Subject: ""Watch the patrols""
The amount of patrols are BRUTAL in this area, inside the ""castle"" grounds you can easily aggro 3 or 4 different patrols in the time it takes to kill one mob just getting into the building.  Each mob has a pet or can summon a pet, so you could very easily be up against 6 mobs in a few seconds if you're not careful.

Once you're in the building you will have to fight off at least 4 to 5 mobs (with pets) at the same time since they will all aggro if you attack any of them.  It cannot be done solo by fighting your way through them without be an excessively high level, which would be pointless since the reward isn't worth waiting until you're high enough level to solo the area.

By the time you're at a level to realistically attempt doing this quest you could be grouping up and running WC for the Leaders of the Fang quest and a much better reward.

If you must do this mission follow the above advice, rush in, get into the corner of the ""stage"" (not the bookcase corner, the other corner - the corner opposite the stairs leading up to the stage area) and rez there.  You'll only aggro Ataeric that way.  He shoots you with frost bolts and will freeze you in place with frost nova, but if you rez, target and start attacking him, and use a healing pot as needed, you should be able to take him down.

I soloed this as a level 20 Warlock (no pet since I rezed in the corner), wasn't easy, died 3 times figuring out the lay of the land.  Finally just rushed in, died, soul stone rezed, killed Ataeric and hearthstoned out. | You can find him at 63, 64 at the Ambermill town hall building with the wall around it.

There'll be 3-4 other Dalaran units in there with him (Always seems to be at least one Conjurer with a Voidwalker in there as well, sometimes 2 or 3 of them). Needless to say, it's a pain. If you're a rogue, you can stealth in, kill the archmage quick, and either run out or die.

Wow, this was tough quest!

First, if you are alliance, pick up the Perenolde Tiara quest in the Stormwind Keep.

Next, go through the crack as mentioned above (34,53).  There are 4 Warmongers in this area: 3 outside the tower and one inside.  Watch the run patterns, because these guys roam a lot and cross each others paths.  They also cry out for help, so make sure not to attack them too closely.

You can actually stand on the castle wall and take an extra shot before they get to you.  This is because they have to run to the ramp and zig-zag to get to you.  Head towards the right side and look for the two-headed guy you need for the Tiara quest.

Head back and wait for the warmongers to re-spawn.  You'll have to tackle some enforcers as well.  I died twice taking the warmongers on early on.  They can crit up to 200 HP per swing and those boys swing fast!  Here's what I found that worked for me:

Engage mana shield
Open with fireball (if you have PoM, 2 fireballs)
Nova Freeze (back up)
Fire Blast
5 Cycles of Arcane Missles (you'll lose mana shield around 3rd cycle, that's OK)
Nova Freeze again
Arcane Missles
Fire Blast
Cone of Cold

Mana jade can also help here.  I have 1100 HP and 4986 mana.  Your health and mana will be very low after each encounter."

507,Lord Aliden Perenolde,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=507,"Run north through Alterac Mountains, through Strahnbrad and through the valley with all the mountain lions/Syndicate personell. You will come up on a farmhouse near the shore of the lake. The Syndicate mobs here are 39-40 and tend to be stealthed. There are two right outside the door, and you will likely have to fight both at once.

Once the door is cleared, be ready to fight two more at the same time right inside the door. It's best to pull them outside so you don't aggro the other mobs in the house. Once you dispatch those, you'll have to deal with Nagaz, a level 40 orc (part of an Alliance quest). Once he's down, there should be one more stealthed mob near the stairs to deal with.

Upstairs, there is one stealthed mob and one regular mob. You will have to deal with both at the same time. Pull them downstairs so you don't accidentally aggro Lord Perenolde.

Once you've finished them off, charge Perenolde. If you have never fought a paladin in PvP, this is a good preview. He has bubble shields and heals, and he's not shy about using them. He also has a sleep spell, so if you are in a group, expect to occassionally be down one person until sleep breaks. He is level 41, but he's not elite.

Nice story but the rewards for this quest wasnt even worth doing the whole chain quest. The XP was ok but u can find better quests coming from the area that take less of a hassle and pay u back with better satisfaction of an item and XP in the end.

*edit (was able to solo at lvl 38) Took out all the spys / enforcers around the house. (There's a chest behind the house on the NW corner) and pull the mobs 1 by 1 from the first floor of the house (2 humans and 1 really fast swinging lvl 40 orc) And then take out the 2 mobs on the 2nd floor.

After going thru literally every page that has to do with this quest, (the item itself, the NPCs, ect) Both classic and retail versions to see all comments (can't see comments past BC on classic version and can't see classic/other website comments on retail versions of the pages) I can, with 100% confidence, say that we, as a community, even after 16+ years, have 0 info on this item other than the fact that it EXISTS and what mob it drops from. The shear amount of time and effort I have put into this is nuts. I spent over 6 hours in hillsbrad/alterac mountains hoping to find it, some times riding around to the spots they have been confirmed to be at when they spawn and using my true sight racial (human) I even marked the farmer everyone agreed to follow with a blue box so I always knew where he was at all times. I managed to get my fishing skill up from 270 something to 290 while here just fishing in pools I had come across, as well as max out most of my weapon skills (paladin) on turtles, murlocs, naga and critters around town. I filled my bags with so much leather I had to vendor some just to loot this thing when they DID spawn.

I regularly kept track of how many people were in the zone with /who for hillsbrad, at the time they did spawn, there were 4 total alliance in the zone, one being me, who had done all other quests in the zone prior. There was a 60 warrior in town as well as a 38 palli, and a druid somewhere in the zone according to my /who at the time. I had gone AFK in the town center between the inn and the town hall to read memes on discord, but left my sound on, shortly after that I heard the sound of a male human die and instantly tabbed back to see the Crier was dead at my feet. I lept to my mount and spammed my target macro and instantly found assassins, they spawn out of stealth, in their set spawn points then enter stealth. The guards did not seem to attack them UNTIL they attacked others. I managed to get the tag on my first kill and helped the 38 palli get his in a group. In total I 'think' 6 died while I was there, 4 of which were from me. The drop rate is 100%, me and him both got our drops first kill. It says 80 something % on their page because you can't loot it after completing the quest.

I have no idea if it was that druid out and about that was questing that spawned the event, if it was a HORDE quest that does it, (they already have a quest to spawn an elite in our GY) Or if it really is just on a timer. But seeing as how it times are not anywhere near something that would seem.. uhh, based on time, (mine spawned at 6:10 AM. My chat logs say the Crier had said ""Hear ye hear ye!"" at exactly 6:10:33. The times I seen from other comments also seem to be completely random. I assume it has something to do with a quest but not in town, perhaps when someone picks up the stack of papers in alterac by the syndicate on their table it starts the event? But the player whom actually did would not be in town at the time. Or maybe it is something the horde did. There were people on both factions questing during the 6 hours I was there, I saw a 25 troll priest by the farms, a 33 troll hunter farming turtles up stream, and many alliance. But I still could not tell you what made the event spawn. The only way I think we will truly find out is if you get together several accounts/players and test it yourself, testing quests and other such things from both factions in a controlled experiment to see what may be the cause, or it might just have a random spawn early morning/afternoon. Or ask the devs directly.

TLDR Still no idea how or why the event happened but after 6 hours of camping I have it. GL to you all trying for this thing. | I am playing on a very low population realm (no one except me in Southshore for this entire span), and here's how it seems to have triggered for me:
Completed  Syndicate Assassins,  Encrypted Letter and  Foreboding Plans. Then did  Noble Deaths and turned it in. A few minutes later this event happened:
Southshore Crier says: Guards to your posts! They must be after the Magistrate again. He must be protected! They could come from any direction!
The Southshore Crier grabs the back of his neck and his eyes go wide.
Southshore Crier says: Assassins... save... th... Magistraaa...
Then the corpse of the Southshore Crier was lying at the bottom of steps of the town hall. Afterwards, Shadowy Assassin where hidden all over the town. Make sure to isolate them, otherwise if guards help you kill them, you won't get credits.
Last edited by Erunehtar on 2021/02/13 | I believe I have finally cracked the case. I have successfully spawned the event, and am going to replicate it on three other eligible toons to verify.

First, complete Syndicate Assassins, Foreboding Plans, Encrypted Letter, Letter to Stormpike, and Further Mysteries. I am not 100% sure they are required, they are not the triggering quest in themselves, but are related and to be safe I complete them first.

Second, pick up Noble Deaths and satisfy it's requirements without turning it in. Return to Southshore. Wait 15 minutes BEFORE TURNING QUEST IN. At the end of this time, I would patrol the town and check all four assassin spawn locations just to be extra safe. The reason is explained below, but if you are lucky and someone else has triggered the assassins they will spawn in this window.

Third, turn in the quest Noble Deaths. At this point, before starting any other quests in the zone, begin the wait. You have now started the ""Assassin Event"" window (trademark: me). 10-15 minutes after turn in (in my first trial, it took 11 minutes), the town crier will run into town and shortly thereafter be assassinated. A pair of assassins spawn behind the town hall near a pair of guards, AoE or focus down one so you get kill credit and get the quest. If you miss it, all is not lost. 10-15 minutes later, Farmer Kent will cry out and you get another chance in the town center. 10-15 minutes after that, a pair spawn in front of the inn for a third chance. I believe 10-15 minutes later a final spawn occurs around shacks, but I have yet to confirm. The final two pairs spawn without NPC chatter. The drop rate is 100% from assassins.

This is why I think this solution has eluded so many over the years: One, waiting 15 minutes for an event spawn triggered by a quest (or possibly all of the quests listed above) creates confusion. Two, the fact the event rolls out over the course of an hour deeply muddies the waters, as anyone stumbling upon assassins in that time can complete the quest without the triggering events. Three, much as with an Onyxia turn-in or Stiches and the Embalmer, when event timers are ""in progress,"" additional completion of the requirements will not trigger the event. In this case, a turn-in locks out further turn-ins for up to an hour (hence the need to wait before the triggering quest turn-in).
Further variables, such as comparing SoD vs. Era servers, Horde activity, times of day, server reset, etc. are erroneous and due to the overall extreme clunkyness of this quest's design. I tave two eligible I am going to recreate these conditions on tonight, and I will update this post if confirmed. If so, I will also post a video of the triggering events to my channel on YouTube, Lore of Warcraft by GleeCon.

All told, way too much effort for a basic quest, but to the true completionists out there, I hope this helps!

You do not need to finish Noble Deaths first to get this quest. I repeat, you do NOT need to finish Noble Deaths first to get the assassins contract.

I went to IF to get the encrypted letter translated. Just for clarity, I also travelled to SW to return the books to Milton Sheaf. I then hearthed back to South Shore, gave the letter to to the magistrate, and began the quest to hunt down Nagaz.

I proceeded to the inn to log, and right when I stepped in, two assassins popped out at me and attacked me. One guard attacked one, but I quickly targeted the other one. Guards helped, they died, I received the contract.

I have Noble Deaths, Baron's Demise, and Shadow Council all in my quest log right now--proof that you CAN get this quest BEFORE completing Noble Deaths. | This quest does not require another quest to trigger.

I basically waited in the centre of Southshore, in between the Inn and the Magistrate's building.

A town crier, yelled his proclamation, to save the Magistrate etc, waited a few more minutes then two Shadowy Assassins attacked me and I was able to loot the quest item.

It looks like the Shadowy Assassins spawn in mobs of two, had them attack me three more times after the initial attack.

You do need to do the most damage and kill the assassin otherwise the guards will take the kill and you will not be able to loot.

I waited around about 60 minutes; between 10:40 pm - 11:40 pm server time (Faerlina).

For those who dont know where Strahnbrad its in the Alterac mountains, just follow the path from the Hillsbrad area north, you will come to a fork in the road take the right one and keep going and you will find it.

As for Baron, hes another problem he can be found in the Inn in Strahnbrad, or in that general area.

If hes not there look in the Sofera's Naze area (Its just south of Strahnbrad).

If hes not there... you can look in the Corrahn's Dagger area as well (South West of Sofera's Naze).

If not there... (I feel for you) but there is yet hope check in the Gavin's Naze area (West of Corrahn's Dagger).

As other people have said if you looked in all four places he has probably been killed... so you have to recheck each again.

There are three ways of doing this quest, basically - the lazy way, the grindy way, and the efficient way.

The lazy way is to simply buy a Southshore Stout before leaving Tarren Mill, giving it to Henchman Valik and completing the quest without having to fight.

The grindy way is to kill syndicates until it drops. You might get lucky and get it early, or have to kill for ages.

The efficient way is to kill syndicates until either the missive or the stout (yes, it does drop off the syndicates) drops and complete the quest that way. | you can just buy the southshore stout from the innkeeper at Tarren Mill"

An easier means of getting the stout for Valik is going to the Innskeeper of nearby Tarren Mills and buying it for less than 2s.

Beware though, I've seen Valik aggro me when I came back to give him the stout.  Just kill him and wait for him to respawn.  He'll go back to being friendly (learned his lesson, didn't he?). | The Southshore Stout can be picked up from the Drunken Footpad, who wanders around the Syndicate Camp. | Subject: ""Side Note...""
You must have the quest Infiltration! before he will talk to you.

Edited, Wed Jan 12 22:34:59 2005 | Confirmed in classic:

Quest giver Valik for Quest: Valik is located at 57, 69.4 (Alterac Mountains, not Hilsbrad Foothills)

Valik will ask for Southshore Stout which can be bought at the innkeepers in Tarren Mill and Southshore.
After giving him the stout, the quest will end, you will get a Syndicate Missive, he will aggro and become kill-able.
You cannot complete this quest if you already have a missive in inventory

This is an alternative to randomly killing syndicate NPCs for Syndicate Missive drops.

556,Stone Tokens,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=556,"Subject: ""Red Shield""
I'm a rogue and have never had a problem killing things several levels higher if I can get them alone. When I first encountered these shield guards almost every fight ended in me nearly dead until I realized that the red shield hurts you for about 85 dmg everytime you land a hit. Good thing is they stop attacking too. So for rogues, whenever you see the red shield pop up just stop attacking and let your energy regen, once you find this out these guys are easy. | Subject: ""Most annoying quest ever!""
This is easily the most ANNOYING quest ever for me as a rogue. Casters, you have no idea. I even just created an account at thottbot just to report of this totally @#$%ed up quest. First of all, there are only a few of them that actually aren't linked, but rest assured, with their totally insane aggro range, the shield guards patrolling the area will easily spot you and come to aid immiedatly. Secondly, the Red Shield they do makes you take damage by hitting them. 85 damage per melee hit I do, which is a sick amount for a rogue considering it takes me like half a sec (in the time I get in 2-3 attacks, taking 250 damage) before I get to react and turn around, whilst I make another hit and take even more damage. I run away 20y or something, start bandaging or whatever, the shield stops and he comes running towards me, voila I descide to engage him again, but OF course the second I touch  him again (doing rougly 3 hits straight up) he turns red again and my health starts to fall. Finally when they are down to 10-15% or so they start running, of course in the direction of his fellow teammates. But no worries, he can STILL put up the red shield while trying to escape and if you are really unlucky (like me) he will aggro them at the same time as he will put on a red shield. Now the only choice I have is to either escape or kill it and die. Running away is futile since you will be low on health anyway allready and with the daze performed by 3 it would be a mircale to survive without vanish.

I have met mobs who have performed that shield 8 times in the same fight, not letting me touch it ONCE before turning it back on, literarly I have hit myself to death from 100% to 0% health.

The back door is very advisable.. I soloed as a lvl 38 Shadowpriest, and when i finally found the place, i easilly took them out..

A hint is: When you can see Gan'Zulah, don't pull him like you are told to by other players. That way you wil aggro both him and the 4 lvl 37 guards. Instead you should pull the guard closest to you. That way you will only aggro Gan'Zulah and 1 guard. After that you can kill the other guards one by one. Then jump onto the platform, and from there you can see Nezzliok (about 20 meters from Gan'Zulah)

As i said real easy.

hope you can use my advise.. | When i killed him took about 45 min to respawn i killed nezzliok 3 times before he repawned so hope that helps | 23.8 (Gan'zulah) Spawns near a throne and two witch doctors guarding him

I'd like to confirm that Ana'thek's spawn appears to be bugged. I saw him in the cave and started medding to take him on, when two other people ran in and killed him (without bothering to ask if, just maybe, I might need to kill him too).

After that I waited around for about two hours for him to respawn and never saw him again. | Subject: ""Trouble finding Headhunters?""
If you can't find any headhunters in the area up thehill, or theonly ones you see are standing next to 5 other mobs. All you need to do is kill other people around that immediate area.The spawns are rotating, so if you kill a Skullsplitter Mystic, thre is a good chance he will respawn as a Headhunter. There are about 10 people that can be killed that aren't near enough to aggro others. Just grind these until headhunters appear. It's WAY easier than steaming into a group of 5 mobs and getting your ass handed to you. AND you get XP for grinding all of the non-Headhunters.
w00t! Good luck lads. | Ana'thek is in a cave in the Ruins of Zul'Mamwe (lower level) with 2 adds. The Hunters are all around this level as well.

All of the ""kill the trolls"" quests in STV can be challenging and a group is highly advisable.
The reasons are:
1)Patrols.
2)Multiple adds.
3)Mobs runnig away and aggroing others.

As a warlock, Curse of recklessnes is a life saver here.Anathek will patrol out of his cave.I was just around killing trolls for the quest when i saw him.He had a caster/healer and another troll with him.Cleared around, sent VW, had him AoE taunt.Then put Curse of recklessnes on Anathek, ran in and used Howl of Terror.Now its just me and him.Killed him, looted armor and died to some 5 trolls who came back.I came prepeared, so i was soulstoned and rezed right away.

Note:if you plan on doing that or something similar, very important to clear around first so you can rez without aggroing anything."

The goblins you need to kill in this quest are NOT the ones on the far north end of Stranglethorn as you might think. They are located just south of the Bali'Amah ruins, east of the main trail. There are some hills south of the ogre mound, yet west of the Zul'Mamwe ruins. You'll find numerous ""Venture Company Strip Miners"" as well as ""Foremen"", and other goblins in the area. They are grouped fairly tight together, so multiple-add pulls are common. Most of these goblins are 41 and above. There are also Venture Co. Tinkerers who will spawn mechanical pets during a fight, so be prepared. However, every goblin that is 40 or higher can potentially drop the crystals. | Subject: ""Experience/Reputation""

Up in the hills,west of the cave
Kill them goblin-strip miners! | You may wish to watch out for Shadowmaw Panthers getting to location 41, 41. They and Stranglethorn Tigresses are skulking about.

The dynamite ranged attacks are a pain; if you're in a group try and remain split up so that not everyone gets their spell interrupted! The dynamite can distract you long enough that the goblin can close the distance and start hitting you. I was taking between 190 - 220 damage on average from those attacks.

I would reiterate that the respawn rate here is *scary*. And the drop rate of crystals is low enough to become a little frustrating. | Subject: ""Location of Miners""
So poeple can find this location with out the use of cosmo like addons. The goblins are located on a set of hills that are situated as follows.
East of the road, south of the Balia'Mal ruins, West of the Zul""mamwe ruins, and north of Crystalvein Mine. The area between the road and the hills has tigerress roaming all over it. Drop rate is 1 crystal for ever 3-4 kills. But every goblin there can drop a crystal. | Subject: ""Thanks for the Help""
I appreciate all the posts because I would have spent hours killing those dumb basilisks on the assumption that this actually had anything to do with the Crystal Vein mine. Basilisks are OK for grinding but only if you're a skinner. Half of the ones I whacked dropped nothing, nada, zippo; but the skins are worth 4-6S apiece at the AH. They also have this annoying ""invisible stun"" trick, where you've been stunned but don't know it until you try to do something to them. Very annoying for casters like my druid.

As the previous posters have said, take out the outlying goblins and try not to aggro the others because they sometimes come out in twos & threes, which is annoying at best and can be fatal to us leather & cloth armor guys. Fortunately the druid's travel form is good for escaping if you're not being stunned to death.

I found the crystal drops to be about 1 in 5 but the goblins dropped lots of other stuff like 2S, silk cloth, and a 1-handed sword (BoE-lvl 41) that the vendor paid 45S for. Not bad.

Edit:(7-2007) Can't believe I'm still here but where else would I be?

I have since done this quest with several other classes. It's neither easy nor really a lot of fun, and the rewards (unless you are looking for the specific items) are not worth the aggravation and armor repair bill.

But what I've had some luck with is saving the quest until you are 42 or 43, at which point it becomes a lot easier and even a little more satisfying as you mash these obnoxious twerps into the dirt and flatten their dime-store, erector-set robots. Not fun yet but.... | Subject: ""<Blank>""

Chuckey, 40,58 | Subject: ""Locations""
Jon-Jon the Crow and Maury ""Club Foot"" Wilkins are in the Ruins of Jubuwai, which is just to the east of the main trail in Stranglethorn. There are Zanzil Hunters (undead lvl 42-44), Zanzil Witch Doctors, and Naga's around this camp. It is a good idea to have the ""Zanzil's Secret"" quest when you do this one, because the mobs surrounding them drop the Zanzil mixtures needed for that quest.

The third part of this quest is to kill Chucky ""Then Thumbs"", who is located in the ""Ruins of Aboraz"", near Zanzil himself on the East cost of Stranglethorn. You can get here by going through ""Mistvale Valley"", where the elder mistvale gorillas are located. You'll see two small trails on the NE corner of that area. One leads to the Troll Shaman's cave where you continue the ""Stranglethorn Fever"" quest, and the farthest back leads to the coast where the Ruins of Aboraz are located. You can also just swim north along the water up from the beach where you find the Bloodsail Buccaneer boats. Be careful when pulling the ruins, because Zanzil himself is inside (level 46).

All three of these mobs are non-elite, and were all level 43 if I recall correctly. | Make sure you pick up  Zanzil's Secret before you head out for this quest. The mobs surrounding the three targets for this quest all drop the quest item you need for  Zanzil's Secret.

found him at 27,70 | If done carefully, you can pull each mob out surrounding him and kill them one by one.
People often grind here, so if you're lucky Duncan may be all by himself.
A useful tip is that if you're too lazy to kill the mobs around him yourself, or you're incapable of doing so, tag a mob and run back to Booty Bay. At the entrance of the tunnel to BB, there are 2 level 60 guards who will make quick work of the Pirates. This way, you can isolate Duncan easily. | Subject: ""Easy kill""
Pretty Boy is a fairly easy kill, though he does tend to be in a camp with a few other mobs hovering nearby.

Either take your time clearing the camp, or have a partner, and this is very easy. Just make sure the casters are taken out! | Subject: ""Easy to do!""
I just jumpt of the pier whre the boat leaves from..  short swim in the the bridge in front of the waterfall...  Pretty Boy is at the camp by the littel boat.  I had to try twice (the first time I got the hole bunch after me :S) but the second time I used a Frostbolt and pulled him out in the sea by himself..
And me - a level 36 Mage - had no problem killing him at all! | Subject: ""Soloed at 37""
The way to solo this is to creep around the camp (assuming you have some form of sealth) and jumping into the water behind ""Pretty Boy""'s camp. Once he's separated enough from his group, just pull him into the water and kill him.

If you get a link, just run and try again.

It's much easier this way than trying to kill the fast-respawning mages (fireball hurts) and raiders (who love to net you over and over and over). | Each of the mobs near his camp (27, 70) can be picked out one by one, this is easily soloable in the lower 40s.

611,The Curse of the Tides,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=611,"The altar is at 25, 24. | Subject: ""Location""
Stranglethorn Vale
* The Vile Reef
* Coords: 24,23 (water) | This quest is fairly simple, but you may struggle to complete it.

First recommendation, before going any further, is to find a source of waterbreathing. Bring a  Warlock for  Unending Breath, or acquire an  Elixir of Water Breathing (whether from your own  Alchemy or the auction house).

For this quest, you're going to be using  Catelyn's Blade, which you 'borrowed' from ""Pretty Boy"" Duncan earlier, on the Altar of Tides to spawn Gazban who you need to slay to loot the  Stone of the Tides. You're going to need to travel to the Altar of the Tides in the Vile Reef in Stranglethorn Vale, which is underwater just off the coast of Bal'lal Ruins at coordinates (24.96, 23.58). The Altar itself is pretty obvious, with a large blue aura protruding upwards a fair distance into the open ocean.

Once there, you're going to need to clear the area around the Altar. This is the hardest part of the quest, and you may need to form a group with at least one other player to accomplish this at the appropriate level. The Altar is surrounded, underwater, by a large amount of Elite Murlocs—such as the Saltscale Warrior and Saltscale Oracle—which you will at least need to clear from the immediate vicinity in order to interact with the Altar. As typical of Elite mobs, these Murlocs hit hard and have high health pools (easily clearing 3000 HP.)

When you've cleared enough Murlocs that you can reach the Altar without aggroing any, interact with the altar to spawn Gazban. He is rather weak, especially compared to the Murlocs you just dealt with. Shortly after being engaged, he transforms into a Water Elemental. However, unlike other Water Elementals, Gazban is not immune to frost damage in this form.

Killing Gazban allows you to loot the  Stone of the Tides from his corpse. This will be your prize, and you can now return to Baron Revilgaz in Booty Bay to claim your reward. | Subject: ""Just buy Waterbreathing pot""
This quest was very easy with water breathing... also I am lvl 44 hunter now.

I also swam around the area (quite beautiful) and found a lot of giant clams (4)

The location is correct 24,23. If you do not have cosmos get it!... no just kidding.

This location is just Southeast of the vile reef island with all the water elementals. Look for a big rock sticking out of the water (just south of the rock). If you are a hunter with tracking it will be easy to spot all the murlocs grouped together.

And yes Gazban turns into a water elemental. | This quest confuised me abit.
Order:
Get Catelyn's Blade from ""Pretty boy"" Duncan.
Go to Booty Bay with Dagger.
THEN go to the Altar, at the Cords 25,24.
Kill the spawn that comes when you use the dagger, and go back to Booty Bay. | Gazban: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=2624 | Subject: ""not broken""

It is on the opposite side from the shore, between the slab and the shore, so to speak ... it has some type of glowing aura around it .

A week before the Battle of Bull Run, Sullivan Ballou, a Major in the 2nd Rhode Island volunteers, wrote home to his wife in Smithfield:

July 14, 1861
Camp Clark, Washington

My very dear Sarah: The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days — perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write again, I feel impelled to write a few lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more …

I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans on the triumph of the Government and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and sufferings of the Revolution. And I am willing — perfectly willing — to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt …

Sarah my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me unresistibly on with all these chains to the battle field.

The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them for so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when, God willing, we might still have lived and loved together, and seen our sons grown up to honorable manhood, around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me — perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar, that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battle field, it will whisper your name. Forgive my many faults and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often times been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness …

But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the gladdest days and in the darkest nights … always, always, and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath, as the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by. Sarah do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again …

head into Stormgarde and go to the right, don't go up the ramp.  Just kill defenders.  The drop from these is about 1 in 5.  The good news is the drop is usually more than 1.  I got drops of 2, 3, and 4 sigils.  I thought I was missing something after killing 6 of these guys before getting the first drop. | Subject: ""Vindicators""
Vinidicators definately drop them... i just got 3 off of one =D. Troll Hunters are Priests... they cast Shadow Word Pain, Heal, and Sleep. I reccomend using Deathcoil if your a loc and have it when they are casting heal... nice interrupt + damage.

647,MacKreel's Moonshine,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=647,"Welcome to 2019 friends! Classic WoW is back again.

Here are some tips for this quest.

1. The only way to access this guy is by jumping to his little island. There are no direct bridges or anything. You must come from the north western side of the big bridge between Wetlands and Arathi Highlands. When you get closer to him, you'll notice that you might be able to jump. If you go to the corner of the walkway, there is a jagged extension that sticks out. Walk to the end of the jagged point and perform the best jump of your life. If you have any skill or racial that makes you go faster, use it. Night elves, you can kill yourself and use the wisp racial to make the jump if you reallllllly want to.

2. When you grab the quest, DO NOT HEARTH OR DIE. Jump off the ledge and into the water. (the quest gave me 3500xp, it was the last quest of this chain, so it is not required if you are having difficulties)

3. Start swimming north east and the mountainous shore of Arathi will dwindle down into a beach. Head up the beach and then west back into Arathi highlands.

4. I just completed this as level 28, it IS possible. Do your best to follow Arathi Highlands road paths. Avoid any and all enemies if you can. This does not apply if you are a badass and/or higher level and can just kill everything.

5. Head north on the road in Arathi, then take the road straight west to Hillsbrad. Once you're there, the enemy levels are back down to level ~25. Turn in the quest to the dwarf in the BASEMENT of the Inn at Southshore.
Last edited by Sonicsx on 2019/09/04 | How to do this quest:
Go to the coordinates 42.9, 90.0 in Arathi Highlands.
Once there, you'll see a broken off part of the bridge, which you need to jump onto. To make the jump, go to the pointy extension to the right of the bridge and jump over to the other side. This jump may be tricky, but some things can help:
 Druids  Cat Form with talent points in  Feline Swiftness,  Travel Form, or  Dash.
 Hunters  Aspect of the Cheetah, or  Aspect of the Pack.
 Mages  Slow Fall (requires  Light Feather).
 Paladins  Pursuit of Justice.
 Priests  Levitate (requires  Light Feather).
 Rogues  Sprint.
 Shamans  Ghost Wolf.
 Night Elf's  Wisp Spirit.
 Engineering exclusives  Goblin Rocket Boots or  Gnomish Rocket Boots.
Any of the following: Highlander's Boots/Defiler's Boots,  Enchant Boots - Minor Speed, The Postmaster,  Runeblade of Baron Rivendare,  Spirit of Zandalar,  Swiftness Potion,  Nifty Stopwatch,  Skull of Impending Doom,  Noggenfogger Elixir (until you are affected by the slow fall effect  Noggenfogger Elixir).
Any mount would also suffice.
Once on the other side, you can find Foggy MacKreel inside the doorway. Accept the quest  MacKreel's Moonshine (once doing so, you'll be provided  MacKreel's Moonshine and a quest timer of 15 minutes). According to user mawx888, you can also use your  Hearthstone, or any other teleportation. It won't fail the quest.
Jump into the water and start swimming towards 53.2, 91.5, where you can climb back up.
Make your way towards Hillsbrad Foothills by following the road. Once there, speak with Brewmeister Bilger to complete the quest.
Tip:
Once you jump into the water, dive down to 44.3, 92.9 and find the Waterlogged Letter near a dead  Dwarf. It'll give you  Waterlogged Envelope which will start the quest  Sully Balloo's Letter.

As an extra go through the Thandol Span series first, finish by grabbing Plea to Alliance from Rhag Garmason just south of the bridge first.  You can then swing by Refuge Pointe on your way to Southshore for a few extra xp.

The guy that gives this quest is in the remnants of the west bridge of Thandol Span. The only way to him is by jumping from the north side. 

Like guidomuse, I jumped from the right-hand curb.  It's a fairly easy jump if you can increase your jumping distance, eg. cat form, light fall, swiftness potion...  But, depite repeated attempts, it does not seem possible to make it sans buff. 

If you're in a party have one at a time try.  Once someone has it then the rest can go clear out the dwarves (see below) while s/he smims around to the 'ramp'.  Then share the quest.

Once you've made it across, fall to the water and swim east.  There's no mobs in the water here.  Don't bother heading into the little inlet you may notice, you just want the walk-able bank on the north side.  Head up this 'ramp' and you'll make it to the area where you destroyed the explosives in Thandol Span.

In Arathi Highlands there is a Horde group of 5 level 35's that walk this road from time to time, they're part of another quest.  Otherwise the worst is one or two low 30 mobs.

15 minutes is plenty of time to walk, run, swim, fly, hearth or dance your way to the town of Southshore.  Once at the SS inn, head toward the 'kitchen' and down to the cellar. 

Unfortunately, I missed the other quest mentioned, a letter near the base of the bridge."

Thundering Key from 52.50

After getting all 3 keys, go to south west of refuge camp and turn it in.
At 36.57, not the large crystal, its a little stone beside it

ps. this circles should be spotted on map | Burning Key - 25,30
Cresting Key - 66,29
Thundering Key - 52,50 | You just have to use the stones in the middle of the various rock formations in this zone. You will likely have to take out four or five level 39 elementals at each circle in order to get to the middle stone. Each middle stone is surrounded by three elementals, and you have to defeat all three. They will aggro together if you try to use the stone without beating them.

Fortunately, not-so-bright players tend to farm these elementals for their drops (I say not-so-bright because it's almost always better to farm something else)( Moderator - Xp is good there, hence people farm em.). Warriors also have a quest to take out elementals, so if you do this at your server's peak time, there is a good chance you can just walk up to each stone and get the appropriate key.

Take the three keys to the southernmost circle, with all the earth elementals, to finish this part of the quest. | Inner Binding - 36,58 | Subject: ""the keys""
One of the keys is just west of Norfolk Manor.  The other key is just northeast of the Circle of binding (just NW of Hammerfall). the last key is in the circle NW of Go-Shek farm.

You can get drops from the elements that banish other elements you will face.

Once you have all three keys, you go to the cirlce, just south of the road on the way to Stromguard.  If you go directly south of Refuge pointe, you should hit it.

Once you complete, you will get another quest. | Subject: ""Save those Charms!""
The chain of quests started here actually goes much longer than just the three shown. In the end, when you free the Princess, she turns on you and attacks you.  As you fight her, she will summon all types of elemental adds and if you take too long fighting her, there can be a lot of them (lol - I got to about 8 of them...).

As you kill the elementals in the process of doing this quest, you will pick up charms that banish a different kind of elemental (Buring Charms banish Water Elementals, or something like that...). Save these charms for killing the Princess - they are perfect for knocking out the various elementals she summons. The charms don't give you xp when you use them to kill the elementals so there is no real point to using them to complete this quest, but plenty of reason to keep them for the last quest. I imagine you could solo the final quest if you had enough charms (4-5 of each type ought to do it). The Princess isn't that hard to kill, but has a lot of health and fighting 8+ creatures after she has summoned a bunch of elementals gets pretty tough. If you can banish each elemental as they appear, it will keep the Princess alone and vulnerable....

Wish I had kept some.... | Subject: ""FOLLOW THIS:""

Good Luck! | Subject: ""Charms are useful, but very low exp""
When you fight the exiles, you receive sometimes charm-loot for banishing exiles.

Burning exiles have charms for banishing Thundering exiles
Thundering exiles have charms for banishing Cresting exiles
Cresting exiles have charms for banishing Burning exiles.

It's recommended that you keep this order, so you can use charms to quickly kill the exiles.
Burning exiles are on West circle, then Thundering exiles on Outer circle, and then Cresting exiles on East circle.

The row upper circle -> lower circle -> left circle is not recommended.

If you have some charms over, use it on exiles for little free experience points and loot"

I am a human mage level 39 and just completed the quest..

here are some tips:

Princess Trapped is a very easy quest if you can find the cave.. the cave is hidden on the North-East-North of Hammerfall between the rock and mountains.. the pad is behind the tree..

after you complete the first part, second part is a piece of cake if you are level 38+.. else bring some a good friend with you.. however, the chance that the bindings are cleared of the mobs are big.. Alliance always grinding on the firey things ..

Third and the last part: to locate and kill the big ugly fat guy called Fozruk, you first need to locate him.. if you dont have mount, dont spend the whole day looking for him but do something else in Arathi, like killing the Stone Exiles for mount money..  when you accidently find Fozruk, stay with him and call for help.. General messages are always answered and people will come to help you .. (my clan mates made a raid to help me :P .. just for fun we were with 15 people..) .. so if you have a level 45-60 you can get to work.. make sure you get ""Sleepy"" the irritating kobold first, cause he makes you sleep for afew seconds.. after you kill the guy, bring the quest item to the Circle with stone exiles..

after you complete the quest, another level 42 elite appears.. so make sure you are gone or have some help.. (i got help from a level 60 mage undead, i needed to /bow /kneel afew hundred times) ..

last part you go to Ironforge, the guy is found in Forlorn Cavern.

.. thats it people.. I am still busy doing the Badlands part, but i am waiting till i have my mount (10k xp) .. i dont like walking | Subject: ""Keystone""
The Keystone is that giant obelisk in the Circle of Inner Binding. | Subject: ""Loc of""
Waited and waited and waited by the inner circle like the post above suggested.  He never showed up.  Went to the East circle where the comment above stated he spawned.  Sure enough he does.  So DONT wait at the inner circle - people prob kill him before he gets there.  If u just gonna sit and wait, do it where he spawns.  Lots of stuff to kill for XP and loot while u wait too. | A lvl 42 elite spawns either after you complete the quest, or click on the shard to get the next quest, so be prepared. | The Keystone is located at the Circle of Inner Binding at 36.1, 58.1.

Do not start this quest if you can not complete it before logging out. Once you start this quest, you have a 2 hour timer to complete this quest within.

I had to abandon the quest and start over. | Subject: ""No joke""
I did this quest at level 53. I had skipped it before and was bored one day and decided to go back and complete it. Killing nothing but green and grey creatures, it took me a solid hour to get all of the acceptable samples. I obliterated the Tanaris desert - killing everything in sight and testing each sample as I got it. The conversion rate from ""untested"" to ""acceptable"" is absolutely miserable. For a level-appropriate person performing this quest, you WILL need the two hours for non-stop killing. The rewards for this quest after you go back to the Undercity to complete is barely worthwhile - and only if you're of the level where the quest is still yellow to you.

If you're a skinner, this might be a good quest for you, though, as everything you kill you can skin - including scorpids for scales.

I would think hard before deciding to invest the two hours into this quest. It very well might not be worth it to you."

Maidens Folly Log (23,85)
Head down the stairs from the deck, in that room with the stairs on the 1st floor of the ship is a whole bunch of crap in one corner, the log is a large brown book sitting in a cauldron shaped thing.

Maidens Folly Charts (23,84)
Still on the 1st floor of the ship it is in like the centre of the ship. Where the crow's nests post extends through the ship, the charts are against it on the northern side. Charts look like a map or flat square piece of parchment.

Also found a chest on the bottom floor of this ship to watch out for.

Spirit of Silverpine (west-most ship)

Directly below the Charts, on the bottom floor of the ship is the Log.  It lies on the seabed within the bottom floor of the ship. Looks like an open blue book. | Maidens Folly (eastern ship)

Maidens Folly Log
Head down the stairs from the deck. This puts you on the first floor. On that first floor there is a bunch of junk against the wall. Towards the left side you'll find the log (it looks like a book) in a bucket/cauldron looking thing.

Maidens Folly Charts
On the first floor in the center of the ship. They're on the northern side of mast that runs through the middle of the ship.

Head down the stairs from the deck, there are two cannons in this room on the 1st floor - against one is two crates and on one of the crates is the charts - again, looks like a map or square piece of parchment

Spirit of Silverpine
On the very bottom floor of the ship the book is on the sand in the ship. There's a stool/bench a few feet away from it. It's a pain in the ass to get though as there's a ton of Naga around it. | Subject: ""Location of all the items in detail.""
For the purpose of describing the boats the Maiden's Folly is the Northeast ship and the Silverpine is the Southwest ship.

1. Maiden's Folly Map: The hardest one to find it seems. This map is on the middle level of the Northeast boat toward the front of the ship (point end). It is lying on a column inside this largest room on the north side.
2. Maiden's Folly Log: This log is in the Northeast ship in the room with the stairs on the middle floor. The log is hiding in a crate to the left of the door that leads to the rest of the middle section.
3. Spirit of Silverpine Map: This map is on the middle level of the Southwest ship in the room with two cannons. The map iteslf is sitting on some crates next to the cannon that is not pointing out a window. There should not be any nagas in this room.
4. Spirit of Silverpine Log: Bottum level of the Southwest ship, a few feet away from a stool in sand inside the ship. It's guarded by a female naga and a male naga. | Subject: ""A strange quest""
To be nice ... this was a strange quest. Like others have said, the ability of the Naga in the ships to pass through walls and decks adds a level of challenge to doing this. The Naga hang out in the holds (lowest level) of the ships in what I saw were normally two groups of three, so six for each ship. Each ship also has a large hole in the hull on the bottom side, so you can easily enter through there and kill the Naga in the hold, then search the ship for quest items. The Naga's ability to pass through the hull can also be used against them because they can be seen from outside and underneath the ship, either by their actual form or their ""shadow spot"" on the sea floor. While the line of site problem exists as others here have stated, the Naga can be pulled either by waltzing up to them and poking them with a melee weapon, or waiting for them to aggro you, then they can be pulled outside (usually a group of three). Once combat is intiated, the LOS issue is no longer in play and I was able to freely cast on them even though they were on the other side of a wall. Their corpses can be looted through the walls as well.

The most annoying part of this quest was finding the Maiden's Folly charts. Two of us swam around killing Naga for 20 minutes before I gave in and came here to find out where the charts were located. (Nice pictures BTW ^_^)

Before starting on this quest I went and did this two leg series first -  Gyromast's Retrieval It was very easy at lvl 44 to get the elixer. ^_^

The silverpine logbook is on the sand. Ship #1 You can see it through the hole in the bottom of the ship. There is probably 1-3 mobs there. Pull them out before fighting them.
The Silverpine charts is on a crate, Ship #1, near a cannon, on the deck above. Swim in through the cannon-openings.
The Maiden Logbook is amongst the junk, Ship #2 (I saw it in a bucket?) on the second deck, near the doorway, after you swim down the stairs from the top-deck.
The Maiden charts is on the ledge, Ship #2 around the mast on the second deck. No need to swim down into the bottom of this ship.
ALL these items are colored almost to match the surroundings and can be very hard to spot. If you have problems finding them, take your time to carefully mouse-over the areas.

This mission earned the ""most hated mission"" from me! Gah. HORRIBLE Line-of-sight. Underwater. hard to find items etc.

Edited to clarify since this still seems to grief some players.
Hope this helps.

Okay here's my attempt to explain where these are.

The MF charts are at 23,84 on the second deck on a low shelf that circles the base of the mast.  The MF log is at 23,85 also on the second deck at the bow of the ship inside a half-barrel among some crates.

The SS charts are at 21,86 on the second deck on top of a barrel near a cannon in the bow.  The SS log is at 21,85 on the sea floor inside the ship at a hole through the hull (accessible from outside). | Subject: ""locations""
The Silverpine chart is just as you come down the stairs to the 2nd lvl. The log is on the bottom were the hole in the boat is located.

The Folly chart and log are on the 2nd lvl. The chart is on a ledge and the log is in a pot by a bunch of other junk. | Subject: ""Repost of locations.""
Reposting the useful information.
The silverpine logbook is on the sand. Ship #1 You can see it through the hole in the bottom of the ship. There is probably 1-3 mobs there. Pull them out before fighting them. coords 20,85
The Silverpine charts is on a crate, Ship #1, near a cannon, on the deck above. Swim in through the cannon-openings. coords 20,85
The Maiden Logbook is amongst the junk, Ship #2 (I saw it in a bucket?) on the second deck, near the doorway, after you swim down the stairs from the top-deck. coords 23,85
The Maiden charts is on the ledge, Ship #2 around the mast on the second deck. No need to swim down into the bottom of this ship. coords 23,84
Thank mesophan for the details and someone else who provided coords.. :P

As a hunter I would send my pet in to attack, follow him in and wing clip the mob. Usually they would not be able to get away. Anything you can do to keep them from running, mage frost spell, pally HoJ, etc. is vital. Havew underwater breathing as well otherwise it will take you FOREVER having to go up and breath after about every kill.

I don't know what the xp was on it, wasn't paying attention. I was 45 when I did it so I want to say it was around 2250 and you get an item to sell/d.e.

Edited, Feb 12th 2007 8:58am by Novotny | Subject: ""Screencap""
I tried taking a screencap of the Maiden's charts, since people are having a lot of trouble seeing where they are.

http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b166/carna_icons/charts.jpg

As you can see, they're sitting where my mouse is pointing, on the ledge there. After coming down the stairs on the ship, go through the door into the little hallway where the log is, and then continue through the right door and turn left, and there they are.

Smolderthorn | This is probably the most annoying quest I've ever done. If you don't have a lot of water breathing pots or an ability to breathe underwater, don't bother with this quest. Also the naga have an annoying tendancy to clip through the ships while fleeing making killing runners next to impossible.

Proceed with caution. | This quest is simply horrible. Maurice's post helped alot but I had trouble seeing the Maiden Charts and the respawn timer on those Naga is insane.

Here is a screenie just to clarify where it is:

Where is it: Arathi Highlands (SE of TM - follow the road)
Cosmos Level: 32
Creep Level : Ogres are 32-33, Enforcers are 33-34
Located at : Ogres are anywhere from 31, 48 to 35, 44, which is North (and a little East) of Stromguard. Enforcers are inside the cave at 35, 44

Creep XP : About 230 (for a level 32 mage, with normal rest)
Quest Completion : 2550 XP, and 30 silver.
Creep Drops : About 1 silver, and 30 copper per ogre. Good farming for tailors, since I had a pretty constant drop of silk and wool

Tips : - When they become enraged, they double their damage (from about 45 per hit, to about 100 per hit), but become much slower. Even a few steps back will buy you a few seconds more.
- I noticed that they had a fairly decent aggro range, so its best if you cleared the area instead of sneaking by them.
- Ogres are based along the road, and just North of Strom. The road is used often by both horde and alliance, but I noticed more alliance than horde. Some folks also wait for their group on the road outside Strom, so you might
get picked off if you're on a pvp server . Its best to try and stay infront of the cave.

- Really good area for Herbologists. Noticed an assortment of plants =)

Finish:
Cash it at Hammerfall with a guy called 'Drum Fel' on the upperdeck, near the inn, at 74, 33
Time:
Took me about 40 minutes as a 32 mage, but I died twice, and did some pvp fighting.

Enjoy =)!

WHO:  31 shadow spec ud priest
WHERE: 36,43  Boulderfist Outpost

NOTE:  Remember: as a priest DISTANCE is your friend.  Start clearing outside the mine entrance.  The ogres (need 8) are all roaming around the outside.  The enforcers (need 10) are all inside the mine.  Most of the enforcers are 34 but u can find some 33 inside or as respawns.
As a low level the trick is to get the enforcers one at a time.  You clear the outside (2-3 ogres sitting around) so that you can hit one of the enforcers and drag him out a bit so you don't have to worry about any addons.  Basically you take care of the ogre requirements and provide a safe area to clear out enforcers.

An awesome strategy that I found was that when the ogres or enforcers become enraged (their fists will start glowing red) is to run back a bit and start attacking from far away again.  When the ogres/enforcers become enraged their walking speed is reduced to about 50% it seems.  This makes it ridiculously ez to kill them as long as you don't get any adds.  Also you get minimal damage should be unable to shield. | Subject: ""Mobs""
The ogres are outside the mine.

The enforcers are INSIDE the mine.

Quest is listed as 36, but my 33 druid was able to solo them also. For the lvl 35 headhunters, just use bear form if you need. The others were ok in humanoid or cat form.

Had a little less luck with the drops but as long as you're getting exp, they were giving about 150-200. So that adds up too , anyway.

killed about 6000 exp worth (at about 200 exp, you can see how many that was). finally made my way into the cave and got the knife on the first shadow hunter. they may drop outside also as stated by others, but only got from these guys while i was doing it.

Tower is at 18,64 in Stormguard where the fat smelly Ogers roam. When you activate defences, stand near the frendly water elemental guards as they will help fight. | Subject: ""Reading the plan is a good plan!""
Firstly, the ledge is a good plan! However, having not read the previous instructions properly I did NOT enter Stomgarde, but proceeded to pick my way round the outer wall to the southwall looking for a ledge! Don't do this, as you will fall in the sea and have to hearthstone (in my case to SW)and griffin back, as there is no way back up without a very long swim!
So, having dunked in the sea, hearthed, froze my butt off, still dripping wet, on the back of a griffin, journeyed across treacherous highyways back to Stromgarde, I entered the place. Took first right then left. Found the ledge to my right just as the road dips. The jump up is just in the corner by the little black shrub. The good news is that i got the drop from the first shaman i killed - having traversed to the far side of the ledge. There is a big gun elite halfway along with some shaman - aviod these as they will pull as a group.
I recommend the shaman on the far side and going into stromgarde first helps! Anyone got a towel?"

If you see some tents,  then you're at one of the posts.  Only 3 and very close to each other.  The first one is right on your left as you enter the crag, other two are just slightly further in..  Can't missem really.

788,Cutting Teeth,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=788,"Subject: ""How to do this quest.""
First of all, you need a Priest.

If you're not a Priest yourself then reroll a Priest. Now.

Then, you'll need to get into a guild doing at the very LEAST MC, preferebly BWL or AQ40. Not Naxx though, they'll only have Frost Resistance.

Right, now get 2 full raids together (if you're skilled one will do). You'll be pulling. Head north of where you started and you should start seeing the boars - they are not to easy to fight. Pull with a smite, and run as fast as you can (it doesn't work if you don't use a smite). Now, the first raid sends a tank in, and everyone spam heals the tank. The Boar can breathe fire, and do other nasty things, like get a critical strike, on top of hitting you normally for massive damage. All mages will need to use Arcane spells, Warlocks will have to use only their Voidwalkers (only thing Warlocks can use to damage these is the Voidwalker), and everyone else needs to nuke, 'cept you. You need to do /dance.

The fight will last for 2 hours roughly (Beware of adds!). When you are done, feel free to loot. All items will be HUNTER LOOT but you'll get them anyway.

Repeat until the quest is done.

Congratulations! You won't find better equipment then what you receive from this quest until you've reached double the level you are now. | Subject: ""YOU NOOBS THAT WENT TO ORG AND BARRENS ARE IDIOTS""

816,Lost But Not Forgotten,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=816,"Subject: ""This is where I find the croc with the amulet:""
Ok, so it seems like the croc is all over the place... west from the house or somewhere south from the bridge.  I've done the quest at least 6 times now and here's what I can say definitively about which croc drops the amulet:

1. It does not look special in any way.
2. It is not named special in any way.
3. It is not a certain level.
4. It does not have an exact location.

Since it seems to be a quasi-random drop, here is how I find it with a minimum of grinding:

1. I always hunt southward from the Durotar/Barrens bridge.
2. I only need to go as far south as the ""house"" that is on the western bank  of the river.  This is the ""house"" with the stables outside of it.  Peons roam the grounds.
3. I have not found it any further south than this.
4. I may have to make multiple swings through this track of the river, but usually not more than once.

In contrast, I have never once had it drop north of the  bridge after several hours of hunting.

Zalazane spawns around 67,88 and he is patroling in a small area around these coords. So wait until you can do a clean pull without aggroing any other trolls.

http://files.upl.silentwhisper.net/upload6/Zalazane.png

PS. When you are doin this quest you should finish Minshina's Skull too. | A shortcut to doing this quest:

1. Zalazane walks back and forth. His path leads him to the top of the hill where Minshina's skull is.
2. Important: there is another ramp (I'll call the ""Back door"") opposite to the one he walks up. This one is less conspicuous and is the one you should walk up to fight him.
3. At the bottom of the Back door is a Hexed Troll and a Raptor.
4. They are separated far enough for you to take down individually.
5. After taking them out, walk up the Back door and patiently wait for him to return to the top.
6. Confront him isolated from his henchman.

I don't think it needs 13 plus, as I've never had any difficulty with Plainstriders. However, whatever you think about that, this quest is worth it, even if the drop rate's a little low. I did it while I was doing other things; I tend to kill any available enemies anyway as I'm a skinner/leatherworker and find it useful.

I find it's worth it for the nice quests it leads into; they're mostly simple killing, which I find is much like grinding with an eventual reward. Nice, in my opinion; I'd be killing these things just to up my level whether I was questing or not. Heaven knows why so many people complain about these quests, as they're intended to make grinding less boring rather than give massive rewards."

I just made a male troll warrior, and carefully walked him over to mulgore (not discovering a darn thing, especially XR) and started like a tauren does in red rock mesa with 0/400 xp.  :)  Let me clarify that,  since i had 0/400 xp while standing in mulgore as a TROLL,  i did not discover or unveal anything in all of barrens or durotar,  including XR or camp T.  although i did have to touch gold roads once or twice, but that doesnt reveal map.  then i leveled up to 9 while doing tauren quests.  i went to camp tarajo after all that, (which i also managed to not discover uuntil that point of course) and kirge had no '!' for me. 

then, just to absolutley double check, i made a male tauren warrior, same gender and class, and even with the exact same name!  and did only the exact same quests my troll could do (leaving out the waterwell quests, and the quests from the start npc that gives you a note from the trainer so you find him the first time).  and of course there was a '!' for me then.  same EXACT quests turned in!

so in summary,  the only difference besides my race, was the order in which i turned the the quests, and that i had valley of trials explored (troll starting zone).  Not only did i talk to the same npcs (and ignored the same ones between my troll and tauren too), I even discovered the areas in the same exact order, except for when the troll starts in valley of trials and i had to step in barrens once of course.  also,  if the server logs me as stepping in gold road or southern barrens (not 'discoverable' areas that give xp,  they just chage the title in your minimap)  and THATs what makes it happen, then your screwed.  You CANNOT  get to mulgore without stepping in southfury river, the barrens, and southern barrens.  i suppose you can avoid southern barrens but then you MUST then touch agammagor or camp tarajo, which give xp for discovering.  i'd have to say that IF this quest is NOT tauren only, then it doesnt matter anyway, cause its impossible for any thing besides a tauren to go through the exact proper hoops to get it. 

case closed fellow gamers.  just go to thork and start from there if you aint tauren"

I'm an alliance night elf hunter. I had made the trip to Barrens during my early levels specifically to tame Humar (black lion), since I wanted a rare pet that I could level all the way to 60 and be proud of it.

Then I found out everyone and their mother had one since it was easy to locate and tame.

Much to my dismay, I kept him regardless, since he was cool to look at anyways. But when I heard about Echeyakee and his glorious white coat, I had to have him. Him being restricted to horde only quests made him more appealing and rare.

So I camped that spot for a day. Finally I see a level 16 rogue come by and spawn Echeyakee. I rush over and try to gank the poor guy (I'm a carebear usually)... And realize Barrens is horde territory. He wasn't PvP flagged... Oops.

I wait for the next guy, and try to train some mobs on him after he spawns the lion. No good, they always manage to kill him before going down themselves.

I try to tame while he is being killed. The tame action is broken off once the horde hit Echeyakee.

In the end, I tamed one of the regular lions around the area, call it ""HelpTameEch"", and then immediately ask a hordy who's about to spawn Echeyakee to /wait, /point at my substitute pet, and then /beg.

Finally a mage cooperated. He even sheeped him for me while I tamed :D

If you travel east of Grol'dom farm, you have to remain close to the mountain side.  As you progress eastward you will come across a tower.  Travel north  from the tower along the mountain side.  You will come across two Kodo ribcages that are seperated by a small clearing.  Savannah Huntresses prowl around it so you must first clear the area of these cats.  They respawn fast so don't bother skinning them (you can come back to that after you bag Eckeyakee). 

Once the coast is clear, stand in between the Kodo rib cages and blow the horn.  Eckeyakee will charge you.  As soon as this happens start back tracking, step back far enough to avoid aggroing respawning Savanna Huntress'.  I am a level 14 warrior and was able to kill Eckeyakee, for my trouble I received the Bloodspattered Shield of the Tiger (nice bonus). | Subject: ""cautions""
first, the horn is one-use. You blow it, it disappears. If you don't get the loot then, you have to abandon the quest and go get it again.

second, Echeyakee will go after the closest player, regardless of who summoned him. Just as i summoned him, an undead player ran across the area, and Echeyakee attacked that one instead. So i got nothing, the horn disappeared, Echeyakee never respawned (and his body never disappeared), so i had to abandon quest and run back to get it again. i must've waited nearly half-an-hour."

Same drill of murdering and mayhem. At this tower I found my last contract, Cannoneer Whessan. Ok, so now all this is done and you need to fight your way back to Ratchet. Simple and quick.

My result:
You gain 1550 experience.
Your reputation with Ratchet has increased. | The medals have either a really high drop rate or a 100% drop rate when you have the appropriate quest. Everytime I've done the quest, I've had at least two other people with me, and by the time we had killed the three leaders for this quest, we'd already gotten all of the medals we needed.

Also note that in the first tower you encoutner after entering Northwatch, there will be a Blood Elf (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=3465) that wants you to escort him back to Ratchet. It is suggested that you wait to do the escort until after you have killed all three leaders. If you enter the tower and do not see the Blood Elf, someone else is currently doing the quest (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=898), so you'll have to wait. | Subject: ""Guns of Northwatch""
Exploit has never been fixed.  You can come over mountain to the west of Northwatch Hold.  You should be looking at the western wall.  Drop down between the wall and the mountain, follow north to the edge.  If you look east, there's a climbable ledge with a single guard.  That's a back entrance that takes you to the last tower of the quest objective.  The mobs are really light in this area, as the majority are centered at the MAIN entrance."

A word about drop rates:

They are chances affected by a random roll.

They do not improve because you leave, or because you already have one of the items, or because the moon is full.  They're chances in a random roll.

If the items do not drop for a long time, it is only because you are unlucky.  There is only one way to get them to drop, and this is by increasing the number of rolls -- e.g. by killing more.

Don't complain too much.  The XP for killing these things is immense, they drop decent greens and wool, which is always in high demand. | Subject: ""funny thing...""

Couple of things to note: 1) As with other escort quests, there are occasions where mobs don't attack. They'll just follow along behind for awhile. This can save you the trouble of killing them, however, if the escortee stops (such as for an 'ambush' or to fight a different mob), the ones following will attack. 2) There are no ambushes on this escort quest, there won't be a time where 2 or 3 come out of nowhere.

Can anyone tell me where he is?
i�ve been looking for him a while now and would appreaciate an answer as soon as possible :D

thx | I believe NPC spawn timer is about 18 minutes and quest takes about 12 minutes.

Atleast for me, the previous group accepted the quest at 13:42:15 ST, we accepted the quest at 15:00:03 (waited a bit for everyone to accept) and we completed the quest at 14:12:15. Spawn timer might be effected from the previous group's speed.

I believe only one person needs to get the quest, I didn't accept the quest but when someone in our group accepted it and started it a pop-up came for me and I got the quest from that pop-up. However, some other guy who accepted the quest from the NPC was not able to give in, only the guy who started the quest (I mean the walk) and the people who accepted the quest from from the pop-up was able to turn in.

I read most of the posts on here and you all really confused me.  The place you can find the timberlings that drop the tumbers is about half way between Dolnaar and Darnassus.  It is north of the road (43, 41).  The south end of the lake makes like a circle (it pools) and there is a dock... if you see that you are in the right spot.  All of the different types of timberlings will drop the required items.  I only had to kill like 10 of them to get the five tumors.  DO NOT GO TO LAKE AL'AMETH the timberlings there do no drop the tumors. I hope this will help and happy hunting. | Subject: ""Alliens tloc, teldrassil, wellspring lake""

IGNORE ALL USELESS POSTS ABOVE, and follow this!

I don't know why the instructions say to go to the north of the mountain.  I went to 47,24, and went up from there.  There is a very small centaur camp at that spot, but easy to walk around.

Once you get up there, keep to the west side.  The cave is not quite at the highest peak.

The place to use the stone is just a few feet inside the cave.  It will be obvious, because there is a big glowing crystal in the air there.  Roth is guarding it, so it will be obvious for that reason too.

P.S. the power stone is on the table beside the quest giver. | Subject: ""Correct Information""
I see so many locations on all these posts, so let me clarify which is the CORRECT WAY TO DO THIS QUEST.

I picked up the stone from the table near the quest guy, i then followed his directions and i CLIMBED the mountain at 51, 21, once there DONT head to the HIGHEST peak as there is no alter here, head to 47, 19 which is close to the highest peak, there you will find a cave, inside the cave is 2 level 11-12 burning blades, and a level 15 fighter with an axe, i managed to lure these out one at a time, inside this cave is the alter.

I did this quest solo as a level 12 orc fighter.

Edit: There was no Elite mobs that i saw

Edited, Wed Dec 7 04:23:38 2005 | Quest: ""The Demon Seed""

This is considered a Durotar quest but the entire quest takes place in The Barrens. (All coordinates are given on The Barrens map).

- 62:20 - Ak'Zeloth (starts the quest)

- 62:20 - Flawed Power Stones (examine it) and click ""Complete Quest"" although you're not really completing anything.
(Note: You have 30 minutes to find the altar once you pick up the stone).

- Do as the quest log says and head towards Deadmist Peak.

- Get up the mountain however you want, I'm not going to debate the ""best"" way to get up it.

- 47:19 - This is the cave entrance, you will need to clear 5-10 mobs level 11-12.

- 47:19 - The Altar of Fire (examine it)

- 62:20 - Ak'Zeloth (turn in the quest) | To get the Flawed Power Stone, head to 62x,20y. Its a clickable item on the table next to Ak'Zeloth at the Far Watch Post in The Barrens.

Once you have your stone, (remember the stone will destroy itself in 30 minutes so be quick) Head to Dreadmist Peak which is roughly at 49x,15y. Climb the side of the mountain to the top. The sky will change to a fiery orange and you need to look for a cave guarded by a bunch of mobs. They can all be single pulled if you are careful. The entrance to the cave is exactly at 47x,19y. Once inside place the Stone on the Altar of Fire and whammo~ the quest is done!

~Kbizzle | Subject: ""Details""
Fairly simple, follow the quest directions up the path and hang a right, heading North. The very first mountain you see to your right is what you want. Go to the North side of the mountain and then up the ridge. You'll see lots of Burning Blade cronies there that range from level 10-11 in two camps up top. The uppermost camp is where the level 25 undead guy is at. You want the camp below him on the northern face. There's a cave inside that you fight your way to and then spring it open if you brought the Flawed Power Stone with you. I soloed this as a level 14 mage. So, it's a breeze. | Remember to pick up the stone from the table!"

There are many Grells inside the cave, so get a party if you are around level 6 and don't want a lot of hardship. | Subject: ""Even easier now""
If you're a first-time player, this quest will certainly cause a lot of pain. I came back to do it as a 12 druid (my first character) and it was still mildly challenging even then. The greatest challenge is the sheer number of Grells inhabiting the place � getting anywhere to explore the cave is a challenge for anyone under level 8 or so.
In this cave, there are two ""major"" spawns � Melenas and Threggil.
Melenas the level 8 satyr is up on one of the ledges � yes, there are actually two ledges, nearly identical to each other. Go figure. It's not true that he keeps spawning on different places, it's just that the whole cave is really, really confusing � until you memorize it. Just go in, and after the 90 degree turn to the left, go right, and keep to the right wall. The tunnel will start turning left, and you will end up in a chamber...If I do remember correctly (it's been such a long time) you want to turn right, and then juke left at the first turn � don't keep on going, it'll just put you on the wrong ledge. Melenas is like the purloined letter � in plain sight. He's just way up there in the haze with his accomplice. First, kill the two blue Grells, and then take out Melenas' bo9dyguard, and finally Melenas. Melenas transforms into a Nightsaber-like beast after you hit it. You can jump off the ledge into the Grell welcoming party down below in the first (or was it second?) chamber.
While you're in there...Threggil is a level 6 rare-spawn that runs around the first chamber � the one that you go into if you keep walking forward after the first turn. Threggil has a nearly-guaranteed drop, the Keen Machete (2.5 DPS main hand sword, if you are so inclined to find out). Be aware that you will most likely get one or two adds, since all the Grells are placed very regularly throughout the chamber.
I tried soloing this as a level 5 (level 5 for the most part, took out Melenas after I hit 6) rogue, and although the Grell are annoyingly perceptive, I was able to kill Melenas after two ungraceful deaths � one after killing the two blue-colored Grells and one after killing Melenas' accomplice Grell. I don't know if it's been confirmed or not, but I didn't seem to be able to even hurt the satyr unless I took out his Grell-servant. *sigh* Wasted two pots and three bandages for some cruddy XP and rewards...Say...If I can do this at level 6 (No, half the time I wasn't in stealth and I was usually handling two level 7s at once) it really shouldn't be a problem for most of you � and I am definitely not a very good WoW player. | Subject: ""EZ quest for level 8""

After talking to her, she begins to wander around the north side of the camp, then up the ramp. She will aggro any mobs encountered along the way. She fights them pretty well, but don't let her die.

After being safely escorted out of the glaive area, she turns and talks to you, then heads off down the road. To complete the quest, you need to find and talk to her sister, in the Shrine of Audessia. This is in Ashenvale, south down the road a ways, just west of Astranaar (the town in Ashenvale).

Last edited by podnov on 2019/09/05 | I feel so foolish. I play a mage, but I forgot to put Arcane Intellect on her. So that hopefully she'd be SMART ENOUGH NOT TO AGGRO 3 TWILIGHT DISCIPLES AT ONCE.

In all seriousness, this is a classic Classic ""escort hell"" quest. Her respawn is long, she'll run away when she's low health, the Twilight Disciples around her are some of the most annoying mobs of their level since they can full heal unless you're smart enough to play a class with interrupts at level 17, mobs will wait to aggro her until she's halfway past them to the next one, she'll ignore mobs YOU aggro unless she's right next to you, and there's a point where you're getting close to the ramp back out of the pit where it's very easy for her to pull 2 or 3 at a time.

On the plus side, she's not the slowest walker in the world and the distance is short enough it's possible to clear ahead without respawns, so that's the best way to get this to go smoothly. If you can pull back the mob at the bottom of the exit ramp and actually get her to fight it with you, you'll probably be fine. | Subject: ""twinka to the rescue""

The ruins are found at the very north end of Darkshore. Just take the road all the way up.

I did not find the relics in chests. Instead, they were in objects that either looked like chalices (wineglasses) or medium-sized balls scattered about the area. There were also some objects that looked like little cat statues, but when you open them you get Cat Figurines rather than the ancient relics. | Subject: ""chalices, spheres and caskets""
This can be difficult if you're low level, because the ruins are filled with high level naga, and LOTS of them. As Gaeolas said, you can get the artifacts from what look like stone wine glasses or stone spheres. There are also these little, stone caskets, like what you'd expect to see a mummy in, and you can get the relics from them.

And watch out for Lady Vespira, she looks almost exactly like the other naga, but she's an elite encounter, and can be even more difficult. | Subject: ""bugged in a good way""
Ok - my quest went pretty easy (solo lvl 21 priest)...

I found the cat figurine at 56, 21 and once it comes to life and you kill it, you actually get a figuring that upon use, activates a cat to fight with you for 10 minutes ... i thought that was worth the mention.

This is what the books say, I thought someone might want to know :)

The Lay of Ameth'Aran:
Long had the children of the stars dwelled upon the banks of the shimmering waters of the Eternal Well. To all was known that Elune, light of the eternal twilight, aspect and goddess of the moon, dwelt withing its waters at such time that she rested from her works. Upon the shores of the Well did the children of the stars, favoured of Elune, build their homes, even as their gaze was trained ever skyward, into the moonlit night.

Though there were many towns and places of habitation constructed upon the lakeshore, Ameth'Aran and Bashal'Aran were the foremost, having the touch of Azshara, the Kaldorei's beloved queen, in their creation. Her favored servitors, those of the highborne, she brought to the twin towns to reside, and to govern them she placed Athrikus Narassin, though it would be that he would spend most of his days in his Tower of Althalaxx, some ways removed of the towns.

His second, a mage known of his prowess in the arcane arts as much as with his physical abilities, was Asterion, who lived among the people of Bashal'Aran, and went many times to Ameth'Aran, to see to the needs and wants of its people.

And so it was, upon the shores of the Well of Eternity, the twin towns grew and prospered, while the world beneath the stars fell slowly to madness.

The Fall of Ameth'Aran:
The earth trembled as the ancient trees in the enchanted forest were uprooted and toppled. The groves and glades tended by the sons and daughters of Cenarius and the stone towers of the children of the stars were brought to the rolling ground. There was our queen, radiant even in the desperation, in the chaos that was the battles. The enchanted changed colors with the discharge of magic, with the explosions that threathened to tear the world asunder.

Brother fought brother. Chosen fought blessed. It was not all the highborne that fought. Some stood, transfixed, as the madness took them. Mighty cities and humble towns alike were felled around them.

In Ameth'Aran, all was in ruins, its people clinging to the ground as though that might spare them from the destruction. It was then that Athrikus Narassin, favored of Azshara appeared to guide them to safety.

With a spell he could protect them, he would say. While around them, brother and sister, father and mother perished, they would have life eternal. And naught to fear from the sundering that was to come...

I have no coords program so I thougt I might help the others that also don't.

He is near the Hot Springs in the west. I started from the Refuge and rode around the edge of the crater, striahgt through everything (be careful in Terror Run, there are elite stegosauruses) to the Springs. When you get there, there are three lakes. A big one, a medium one and two tiny ones that I just count as one...go near the smallest one and he is standing 'neath a tree. Kinda hard to see cause he blends in with the green.

Onece you get the quest, go to the ridge in the center of the crater. Personally, I had fun doing this quest. I traveled 'round the edged of the Ridge and measure about three. If you ride around long enough, you will see a spikey sort of bridge that you can take to one that is higher than the others. That's the hottest one.

Both lockboxes can be opened from the outside of the ship. Just stand behind the ship and move your cursor around until you find the box. | Subject: ""Not as hard as you think""
Did this solo as a 17 hunter. Only death was my pet, once.

First of all, not sure if this matters or not, but I did the north ship first (Mist's Veil). Went around to the side with the big hole in it, stayed just under the surface where the camera shows underwater, but you don't start holding your breath. Targeted a murloc, sent the pet in, and hit follow button to pull it back when he got their attention. When the murloc was almost in range, sent the pet back in, and proceeded to light the little bugger up. Wash, rinse, repeat. Lost the pet when it pulled 4 out, but killed two of the murlocs and swam for my life. The clams are a frequent drop, so if your pet eats clam meat like mine does, no worries about happiness loss.

Got all the fish outside out of the way, then waited for the ones inside to show up through the hole, target, and sent pet, etc. Swam down a couple times to check if the way was clear, eventually it was, and went inside to grab the lockbox. Oh, forgot to mention, used Eagle Eye from a safe distance to make sure I knew where the thing was, a major help.

First lockbox down, headed south, keeping clear of the murlocs. Used Eagle Eye again, eventually spotted the lockbox for the Silver Dawning. In the process, noticed the following:

A. The lockbox was easily accesible from a gunport-looking entrance in the side of the ship, near the back.

B. There were almost NO murlocs nearby outside, and from what I could see, absolutely none inside near the gunport and box.

Intruiged, I killed all of 2 murlocs outside, put my pet on stay, and headed in. 10 seconds in, 5 seconds to loot, and 10-15 seconds out. No muss, only fuss was when I lost the exit hole for a moment. Method might even work on the first ship, don't know. Damn near necessary on the Dawning, the thing is crawling with murlocs.

So, moral of the long-winded story: doing your planning carefully can save you an IMMENSE amount of trouble. Hope this is helpful. | Unless you're a warlock, have an underwater breathing potion or two, are too high-level for it to be meaningful, are a marine mammal in another life or are a closet masochist, this is one you can skip. The rewards are not very good, the XP isn't worth it to offset the time spent, the Darn rep is OK but you'll wonder afterwards how you're ever going to get that lost time back.

Rogues may be able to SOLO this, but if you arent a rogue, you can do this with just two people. THe nearest graveyard is so CLOSE, it isnt even a hassel dying.

The trick?

Both you and your partner go balls to the wall, and swim inside each vessel, and get as close as you can to the chest you seek before you most ultimately die.

When you and your partner return as ghosts, wisp back to the location of the chest in each ship, and have your partner ressurect first. While your partner creates a diversion, and starts to get slaughtered...ressurect yourself, open the chest, get the loot. Then swim your ass off as fast as you can outside the ship. Hopefully before you, TOO, are slaughtered, you can get far away from the monster weasels, and then you and your partner can trade places.

Works everytime, Trust me.

Nat. | Subject: ""should be an ""elite"" quest""
Only Rogues can pretty much do this quest at the appropriate level by sneaking in to where the boxes are at but, even then, it's an interesting event for them -- the boxes are at the front of the ship and require swimming inside to get to them.

The only way to do this is in a pretty decent group or groups. You need to pull the guys out and kill them underwater so, unless you slide in behind a group or what not, you won't get there cleanly to get the quest done.

I play a druid, at 17th level I tried soloing this (it was 'green' easy to me by then). I managed to clear 1 ship enough to get in but the second one... I'd get 2-5 guys per attempt to pull and, even with sea lion form (cannot cast spells when not in own shape), I couldn't handle fighting them all.

get some friends or others who want to do this or simply skip it. The quest results aren't that good and it is Really hard to try this. | Subject: ""And the obligatory reference explanation""

Fortunately I had parked my classic M4 Sherman just north of the camp and managed to escape with only minor wounds. I tried running over some of the remaining mobs but the M4 is pretty slow and they just jumped out of the way and threw empty beer bottles at the tank. I made it back to Auberdine where Terenthis completely ignored me. What a schmuck but he's probably so busy messing with his bear, he doesn't have time to do his job.

Moral of the story: Escape Through Stealth.

All of your directions are misleading. It is north of Auberdine on the beach where the water meets the sand, this is fact. However it is not as you say ""past"" the shipwrecks. It is on the small region of beach directly east of the shipwrecks. -.-

So I went looking for buzzbox 411 today, and along the way I saw some silverleaf. Going off the beach to harvest it, I got my and my pet's tails whipped. Figuring I may as well stay a wisp to look around, I went in search of the buzzbox, starting from where my corpse was heading north.

Suffice to say, if you find the ruins, you've gone too far.

I explored pretty much the entire coastline, then when I went back to look for my corpse, I found the buzzbox instead. It is not up in the grass like the first one is; rather, it is exactly on the beach, just a few steps away from the water line, just past the big sea-green sea monster corpse surrounded by greymists.

Read the posts (thank you!) and my 28 Druid started by pulling and killing one of the rogues. When he reached 10 Health, he healed himself 100% despite my attacking him.

I have to say that this is the most misleading entry from you all I have read here.

It isn't relevant if a level 32 quest is easy for a level 26 or 28 to solo ... it should be darned hard to solo +4-6 levels up.  If you are on or close to level, this quest is very, very easy.

I did it as a level 31 Warlock, 1 level below the quest level.  I pulled each demon one at a time, and not a single one of them was able to heal before I killed them (and I wasn't using shadow bolt at all ... just the DoTs and then wand, with the Voidwalker tanking).  If you are on or close to level you should be able to do enough damage to these mobs to take them down before they can heal.

Pull one at a time, they pulled easily, not once did I aggro more than one other than at the end of the next quest where you have to kill a 32 with his 29 add (which was also easy).

Honestly, guys, this is not a hard quest at all.  Just don't be going around doing it at level 26 or level 28 ... do it at level 31 or 32 (it's a level 32 quest, after all) and you will breeze through it for around 9k exp for all three parts."

You must go thru the large wooden gate but not into the underground hold. I found him at roughly 38,34 but when I disturbed him without killing him he roamed about the general area quite a bit but eventually returned to the fire he was originally huddled around.

OMG... I too had been running around inside the cave for an eternity. It just seemed like the place he'd be. I ran around in cat stealth for a while and counted 28 furbolgs in only about half the cave (so there's probably around 50 of them in there).

Finally I read this, and went back outside to hunt amongst the camps... found him outside!

Thanks! | Subject: ""Sit and wait..""
Once you follow the directions to get to the camp from the previous poster and pass under/through the wooden gate to the main part of their village, the road forks north and east.
To the east, next to an uphill trail, is a small village with about 5 or 6 Furbolg. This is the best place to wait for Dal. While waiting, keep the area clear of Furbolg. I usually wait on the south side of the east fork with my back to the hills, so nothing sneaks up behind me.
Dal is easy to spot because he's about a head taller than the other Furbolgs. | Subject: ""The non-cosmos directions:""
20 seconds run north of Ash bridge is a path east/right, easiest to stay on the left after entering.  You must use this path, no other entrance it seems.  After about 4 fights you will see the large wooden gates to the village where he is located. Go through the gates, again staying on the left.  You will see a camp of many on the left.  He will be in that camp or wandering close by.  He is larger and different color.  Cross over to the other side/right side and just wait for him to come out. Watch and be careful others wander also.  As he starts north after his east move, tag him for a pull all the way to you at the base of the hill.  He will stay alone if you do it correct. Heal first, then loot him and retreat to hill base again.  Go out similar to entry."

 Reclaiming the Charred Vale | Subject: ""here's how to find the tunnel & the peak""
I'm not sure why so many people say they had a hard time finding the tunnel b/c there is a lighted path leading to it.

From the road through Ashenvale heading east: after passing through Astranaar you will see small ruins on the south side of the road just before you reach a tower called Rayne's Retreat. The path is across the road (or south). Look for two lanterns close together slightly off the main road, then the path goes down a little hill (watch out at the bottom of the hill for some level 23ish Furbolgs, but easy to avoid just keep running through toward the lanterns). The path runs along the west side of Mystral Lake, you can look for the lake on your map. Silverwing Retreat is on the lake with a few trainers and suppliers & a quest. From the lake retreat follow the path west toward the mountains. There are a few lvl 21 or 22 ashenvale bears blocking the way that you will might have to kill. Entrance to tunnel is at 43,71 in Ashenvale.

Once through the tunnel, make your way South through Windshear Craig. You will first have to make it through some spiders. Just take it slow to avoid aggro, or just keep running. Then you have to cross through the Venture Lumber Co. These guys should be more your level and pretty easy to make it through. Then you will find some more spiders, and finally the road. From here you should see a sign leading you back North up the road straight to Stonetalon Peak. Stonetalon Peak is at the end of the road as far North as you can go, it's a long walk 37,8. Don't forget to get the flightpath.

p.s. if you want to be lazy & avoid the mobs, just die and resurect at the graveyard, but you might miss picking up a quest. The graveyard is on the road and it's an easy run up to the Peak from there.

Other things to note:

The Dust Devil managed to cast Gust of Wind before I killed it.  I double-checked, and it is confirmed by the ""Raptor is afflicted by Gust of Wind"" message in my combat log.

Both quests are easy enough if you know when and where to pull.  I did both of them by myself.  If you are a druid or rogue, the best thing to do is prowl around the areas so you can get a good idea of where people are, where the plans and letters are, and where to run.

Covert Ops Alpha - The wagon is in front of the mill on a small hill.  It sits by itself and has some firework looking things on top.  For those with Cosmos or map coordinates, the mill is at 66,50.  There are two loggers close to it, so take them out.  Then attach the explosives, blow it up, and run along the bottom of the hill towards the mill.  Not all of the Venture guys will leave, but that's okay.  The plans are on the west/left side of the mill, on a tree stump.  It looks like a piece of rolled-up parchment.  I shifted to cat from as soon as it blew, prowled over to the parchment, shifted up, grabbed it, and ran out with only 1 aggroed Deforester to take care of behind the mill.

Covert Ops Beta - This is a little more difficult than Alpha.  The wagon for this one is on a small hill in front of the mine.  The mine is located at about 74,58 or so.  There are no guards on this wagon, just an operator, and he's far enough away where he won't aggro.  Slightly behind the wagon there is a small hill.  You can blow the wagon if you stand on that hill and keep the wagon to your right.

The letters for this one are on the right/east side of the mine entrance, on a tree stump.  They look like a stack of books.

Here's the trick for Beta...the kobolds don't run when you blow the wagon.  So, you need to kill some of them before setting the explosives.  On the west side of the mine, there is another small hill with three kobolds wandering.  Take them out.  On the east side of the mine, along the ridge, there are two other kobolds.  Take them out too.  There is another kobold closer to the letters, but if you attack him you'll draw the attention of everyone else, so leave him alone.

Run over to the wagon (don't let anyone see you!) and set the explosives.  Get over to the hill and set them off, then take off running.  Head over the hill where you killed the first kobolds, then turn to the mine and get the plans.  Then run AWAY from the mine (I went to the east, along the cliffs).  The kobold you didn't kill will most likely aggro, but if you stop to kill him the rest of the Venture guys will be back and aggro.  Just make sure your health is full and run along the cliffs.  He stops giving chase soon.

Good luck, and I hope this helps! | Subject: ""My route to getting the plans.""
When you accept this quest a black bag will be placed in your inventory. This bag contains the instructions, as well as explosives and detonators for both Covert Ops A and Covert Ops B quests. To get these out of your bag you click on them, and accept the question asking if you want to bind them to you. This takes them from the bag and places them in your regular inventory to be used.

The wagon is on a hill south of the mill. You place the explosives on the wagon by getting close to it, then right-clicking on them.

Once placed, move to a hillock which is slightly east of a line between the wagon and mill, and about halfway in between. From here you can blow up the wagon and watch as most of the mill guards move to check it out. Once that's done, you can move in quickly to loot the plans.

Not all guards may leave, so this may best be done with a partner to help clean up the stragglers quickly before the other guards return from the wagon.

The plans themselves are found on top of a crate out front of the mill. They are just outside the south side of the building, west of the ramp that runs up into the building.

You get 2,200 exp for completing this quest. | Subject: ""Locations""
The wagon is at 65, 54.

The plans are at 66, 51.

When you set the explosives, back away from the wagon and move away from the logging camp. When you blow up the wagon, about a dozen Venture Co. personnel will run over to where the wagon was, which should allow you to run in and nab the plans. | Subject: ""I messed up :)""
So...let's say a huntress gets impatient and decides to try to solo this one, and blows up the cart but then gets killed...are the plans something that only appear right after the explosion, or with a couple friends to clear the lumber mill area, could I possibly get in and loot the plans off of the crate without the explosion, as I'm not really sure how to go about redoing the part of the quest to get the explosives again.

Ok, answered my own question. The plans are always there and the bomb just makes a ""semi-handy"" way of getting to the plans. There was still a fair bit of killin and dying involved but luckily there were two of us and handled it quite nicely at level 22. My only problem was that the next step after seems a bit unrelated - the Elf next to Gaxim sends you the Charred Vale to kill things that are around levels 26-28 so will be a bit before the 2 of us can continue on with the quest. | This is part of the long & fun quest chain originating from ""On Guard in Stonetalon"" (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1070) in Ashenvale.

-Special Delivery for Gaxim (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1077)

This quest leads to:
- Covert Ops - Beta (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1080) | I just wanted to note that when doing this quest, you don't actually need to use the explosives/detonator -- but it's kind of fun, so do it anyway. The quest items are right out in plain sight, so all the explosives do is make it easier for you to go in and grab the item needed. So if you were like me and detonated the explosives and then wondered what the heck to do next (I was searching in the wrong area, eep!), have no fear, you can just clear the mobs the old fashioned way and nab the quest item.

This is fairly straight forward. You can see the lumber mill from the entrance of Windshear Crag, and right in front of it is a small wagon of explosives. Kill any mobs near the wagon then set the blue explosives (by right clicking on the blue explosives in your bags). There's no timer on the explosives, so don't feel like you have to rush out as soon as you place it.

To the left of the front of the lumber mill (looking from the wagon) is a crate with a clickable item -- these are the plans you need. Move away a bit from the wagon, edging up to the crate -- but not too far as the detonator has a pretty small radius to work (I think like 20 yards). When you're ready, use your blue detonator (click it in your bags) and the wagon of explosives will... well, explode. The mobs in the mill will run out to see what's going on -- unfortunately, it's mostly the mobs from the front/inside, and this doesn't help much as the mobs you want are on the left. But it's less to clear, so clear the 2-3 mobs left around the crate, zip in, snag the quest item, and zip out before the crowd comes back to the mill. Personally, I think the explosives sort of complicate things more than needed, but explosions are always fun I suppose. | Plans are outside the mill, not inside at 66, 51 (map: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=19602).

Since I last did this quest, it appears to me that the drop rate has been increased. Don't neglect the two Fire Elementals outside the entrance to the Charred Vale near Mirkfallon Lake. They dropped two embers for me on the way into the Vale and another two on the way out, which is almost like a 200% rate.

The higher-level (27) Fire Destroyers near the Southern part of the Vale dropped nothing. Not even copper. Nada, and I killed each of them about three times as they respawn quickly. Just ignore them. The rate seems to increase as you head North through the Vale.

Simple to find the location of something if you have the coordinates but don't have the coordinate UI mod. First coordinate is the horizontal ref. Left side of your map is 0.
All the way to the right is 100. Half way from left to right is 50. 1/4 way from left side moving to the right is 25. The second coordinate is the up-down one. Top is 0. Bottom of your map/screen is 100. So, coordinate 25,25 is in the top left corner of the map (your monitor with the map at full screen).  If players would just realize this they would not have to ask where something is when they have the coordinates but not the UI mod.

MAP: NW of Splintertree Post. On the road heading to Felwood. On the map it's a huge tree icon, you can't miss it. at the top of this tree (there are a few rooms and a ramp to the top room) is Ordanus. He calls a BUNCH of tree pets to fight with him. Luckily when i got to the top, there was a mage with a pet there waiting. We grouped and killed him easy. It might be hard solo with all of the 'friends' he calls. | Subject: ""Useful Info""
Don't you just love it when someone asks 1 simple question, and everyone just ignores it over and over just to brag about how leet they are and soloed this and that? =)

You DO NOT have to fight the pvp guards or go near them at all. Go to the coordinates 63,50 and you will be standing between two stones that marks the short path that leads to the tower that Ordanus is in.

There are a few laughing sisters on the way to the tower that you can take on easy enough one on one enough. However, you will usually fight no less than three guards at one time once in the tower.

I did this solo as a lvl 29 mage, but it was rough indeed.

Make your life easier, take a group if you can.

Happpy questing!

P.S. Just incase my coordinates are wrong, the path to the tower is off of the road leading to Felwood right next to Raynwood Retreat. The tower is on the left side of the road. | Ordanus is located at (61,52) | Subject: ""quest""
best thing to do is to kill ordanus quickly, loot him, then haul ass before his summons can beat you down. | My 27 BM Hunter had no trouble pulling and killing everything on the way up (don't loot - the respawns are very fast) and when getting to the top, I just sent my pet at Ordanus, healed him and we killed Ordanus without too much of a problem while the two other Vindicators (or whatever they're called) beat on my pet and ultimately killed him, as I expected from what everyone has written below.

But then it got more interesting. Instead of the two Vindicators beating me to death as I expected, they started but then about a dozen (two dozen? three dozen?) treants suddenly materialized out of nowhere and descended on me like a massive wave of overgrown poison ivy. Twenty-six against one? Really - you need that many plug uglies to whack a poor troll hunter? Ordanus, you are truly a cowardly bully; no plastic medals for you, ya big sissy.

Fortunately I had read the remarks below, immediately popped a healing potion, looted him and got a chance to rez and chat with my old friend the Spirit Healer for ten minutes whole the hilariously misnamed Rez Sickness wore off. Not only did Ordanus involuntarily surrender his head, he dropped a nice piece of green mail armor, so worth doing even if he needs 700 Macedonian Warriors to kill you.

Soloed at lvl 32, NE Rogue. Easy quest. Here's how I did it.

Headed directly north from the Raceway HQ till I saw a boat half buried in the sand. You can't miss it either. Besides the fact that there were about 17-18 Snappers bumbling around it, it's a large object as well! Best of all though, there are no baddies in the area the Snappers are in, they're just hanging around outside where the Snappers are. The drop ratio I seemed to have here was actually about 45-55% and they also dropped some nice items for the AH, even got one blue letter sword!

The coords for the ship, if you're using Cosmos(which if you're not you need to!), are: X82, Y55. These are the exact coords while standing under the prow of the ship.

I also found one other place that seems to be pretty decent though I was done when I found it. On the eastern wall of the shimmering flats, about halfway up is a rocket car(otherwise known as a Pod Racer for the SW geeks) embedded about halfway up the wall.

To get here, head directly east of the Raceway HQ.

The coords are: X86, Y76. In front of that is a pretty decent grouping of snappers, but they are mingled with Saltstone Crystalhides and Scorpid Terrors so look out!

I decided to post this as allot of people in my guild that are at the point of doing this quest have been asking me how I did it. This has seemed to work out well for all of them, so I hope this helps anyone reading this! | Huge cluster of turtles at 82,54 around the ship. | Subject: ""Experience""

Getting to Badlands is a stinker as Horde, because you have to cross Alliance territories. The way to get there that I have found so far is to go through:
1. Silverpine Forest
2. Hillsbrad Foothills
3. Arathi Highlands (Watch out for Stormwind Guards on the road - there are both Undercity and Stormwind guards as random spawns on the roads in this zone.)
4. Wetlands (There are Alliance NPC's spotted along the roads in this zone, and an Alliance city, Menethil, in the SW corner of the zone. This is a 20-25ish level Alliance zone.)
5. Loch Modan (This is the stinker, since Loch is totally Alliance controlled, and the only way in is through tunnels. If you have a map of Wetlands you will see a fort called Dun Algaz in the SE corner of the zone. This is the beginning of a series of 3 tunnels that go to Loch M from Wetlands. The first tunnel has level 18-ish dwarf mobs guarding it - these you can whack. The next tunnel has a wandering level 30 dwarven guard in it and a second at the far end of the tunnel. These guys give no experience, as they are Alliance guard mobs, and they have elite-range HP. I could kill one as a level 34 shaman, but it took all my mana and left me at 25% HP. The third tunnel has the same type mob (one) guarding it as well, so there are 2 level 30 guards to deal with as you leave tunnel 2 and enter tunnel 3. If you have a group, no problem. If you are solo, as I was, you need invisibility, probably from potions, to pass these guards because killing them will flag you PvP, which you do NOT want going into Loch Modan, a completely Alliance-controlled zone. I haven't made it to the end of tunnel 3 yet, so I don't know how many guards there are there. I assume once you're inside Loch M you can run like heck and get to Badlands from there. There is a pass into Badlands in the south-central edge of Loch M zone.)
5. Badlands (Will post on this when i make it in there. Once there as Horde you can get a flight path that connects between Undercity and Booty Bay; this is a big one.)

6. The other flight path, to Swamp of Sorrows (SoS):

I know this is the only route to Badlands because I tried going another way, in from Stranglethorn and Duskwood from the south, into Redridge Mountains and Burning Steppes. The Steppes are a 50-plus zone; don't go there unless you like graveyards. I spent over 5 gold in repair costs once I got out of there.

Duskwood has an Alliance town named Darkshire in the NW corner, blocking the roads to Deadwind Pass (DW) zone, which you need to get to Swamp of Sorrows (SoS) for the other flight path Horde has on the south end of this continent.

If you can slip up along the east edge of Duskwood, there's a tunnel into DW south of the road through Darkshire that goes to DW. Stay on the road in DW - it's a 50-plus zone.

Once in SoS, stay on the roads, which are patrolled by Horde guards. Once you hit the Horde outpost at Stonard (take the right fork), get the flight path there that connects to Booty Bay. This is also where you must go to get the Horde artisan alchemy quest.

Once you kill one of the mobs there is a chance that a Level 56-58 Hive Drone will spawn.

L54 Druid Tactics:
Sentinels
1) moonfire
2) farie fire
3) rejuvinate self
4) cat form
-- build up combo points until mob is under 1/4 health
5) cat form: rip [DoT finishing move]
6) run along the road until the mob dies

Druids
1) regrowth self
2) moonfire
3) farie fire
4) bear form
-- tank until about dead, using bear self-heal when necessary
5) stun
6) moonfire
7) run along road until the mob dies | Subject: ""How did you guys lvled ??""
Seriously ? How did you guys lvled upto the point where you could get this quest ? All these no good messages telling, no shouting, the readers that this quest sucks ?

This is thottbot, a place to get info on how to complete a quest, not to tell ppl WoW sucks. It doesnt OK ?

If you are unable to complete a quest within the timespan you like you got 4 options:
1. ""Thott"" it.
2. Come with a good tactic yourself.
3. Invite a mate to quest together ( guild, /who )
4. Level and come back later.

Now for this quest, there seem to be alot of ways to succesfully survive the adds. Either by outrunning or outsmarting them. earthshock, entangling roots, earthbind, hammer of justice, frost nova... All seem to work well to either kill the druid/sentinel on a distance or outrunning the adds.

Now to give some info my favo class, mages. We can solo this quest at lvl 54 for all I care. Get to max range (30/35/41 yards, depending on ur build) and start shooting. Remember to use scorch when the mob is to far away for instant cast and to close for a 2,5sec frostbolt/3sec fireball cast. Stay close range and hit him with arcane missles ( which should be the improved, uninterruptable ftw ones) untill the mob is down to 5%-10%. Frost Nova, move back and kill. Remember to counterspell the druid when he is healing himself. Easy to see the green leafies around his hands ( HS animation ). If you do not counterspell him, he will gain approx half his health. In the case frost nova fails, use Cone of Cold and blink.

Now as a frost mage this should really be a walk in the park. All of the mobs are melee attackers so kiting them with FN or CoC absolutly the best way. Added bonus, is that with a good frost-build,  you should be able to kill them with 10-20% of their health when they're frozen.

P.S. I tried it when lvl 54, but I got summoned for an instance when I just killed one. Came back as lvl 59. A breeze. And fantastic good XP. ~250 for the NE, and ~300 for the adds @ 59 !
When only 1 or 2 spawned, it kill them anyway using my favo kite procedures ( FN, DPS, CoC > blink, DPS, FN, DPS ) No good drops, just really nice XP | Subject: ""Not an Easy Quest at 55""
55 Druid fighting Druids. Interesting. Didn't know about the bugs the first time. Almost got them anyway but heal drops to 50% speed during a dual attack (with 3 attacking, just kiss your druid ass goodbye) and I couldn't instant heal fast enough. OK, a surprise every now and then is interesting. I didn't need that armor potion anyway. What's 90S when you can kill a mob and get 5S? Uh wait, that doesn't work does it....

Went back from the Tombstone Tavern and whacked a scorpion just to get my fingers working. No loot and 1 rugged leather. If I wasn't a skinner, my reward for that would be....nothing. Hmmm. Lovely place, Silithus. This time I was ready for the bugs. All I had to do was kill the druid. Weird, but I know what he can do, right? Same thing I would do. Whack, heal, bam, heal, chop, heal, thunk, heal, swipe, heal, hit, heal. Interesting - he can heal himself too (duh, he's a druid). So he heals himself and I heal myself. Then he heals himself and I heal myself. How long can this go on? How about 20 minutes?

I ran from the bugs, not because I wasn't ready for them, but because I read the posts! Also because I was bored. Twenty minutes of fighting & healing cyles is like twenty minutes of watching paint dry after awhile. Like the pendulum in a grandfather clock. I think I will wait a few levels and then come back for this. I hope it has about 10,000XP because that's what I think it needs.

Nice scorpions, though."

Apparently the ore is only found on diggers and surveyors and apparently you need to let them dig before killing them.

I must have killed 15 diggers just after they dug. I noticed however that the one time I finally got the ore, the digger took a break and wiped his brow while digging. Thinking this might be a clue, I destroyed my ore sample and followed three more diggers around and waited until each dug but also did the brow wipe animation then proceeded to kill the digger. Each of the three times I got the ore sample.

Hope this helps. | Subject: ""Here's how I did it:""
I found it between 65,51 - 67,51, watch for the respawn right where the round boulder is up against a small mountain. It seemed every 5-10 minutes a surveyor or someone similar would come around, it was an eventual drop. DO NOT LEAVE THIS AREA.

For those without Cosmos, if you are to come out of Shimmering Flats and take the main road (the one that is almost a straight line through Thousand Needles,) on the map you'll notice that immediately there are 2 hills to the left and one to the right, GO TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE RIGHT MOUNTAIN. Do not go past this mountain. | Subject: ""Get Real""
There is nothing magical about this quest.

You dont need to wait for them to dig.

I advise taking it and while questing through out Thousand Needles chances are high you'll run into enough of these guys to get the item.

I did not see the sharks myself. However, I don't doubt they were there. Plenty of skeletons around as you approach the chest.

I'm horde, so I flew to Brackenwall village in Dustwallow. Then I headed out toward the main road. There are road and bridges from the village to the MAIN road, even though they don't show up on either map. Once on the main road, go North. There are 2 Alliance towers along the way -- be  sure to skirt around both unless you're spoiling for a fight.

Just as you approach Theramore Isle, a graveyard sits on the left side of the road. Exit the road through the graveyard and go down to the beach. I found no mobs here, but you never know.

Now enter the water and swim around Theramore Isle, keeping an eye out for the sharks. When you get to where you can see the first pier/dock, dive down and swim toward the middle of it. The chest is at the base of one of the poles.

As others have pointed out, you can also do this by running around the outside of the castle walls, but that has its own risks with patrols or wandering guards. | Completely safe to do on hardcore. Just swim down from the north (outside Theramore), and dive down when you're in the right place. Just watch out for Threshers on the way there, and possibly sharks when you're diving down. Should never be anywhere near the guards. | Subject: ""Very Easy""
Yeah just as below. Loc: 71,52

Edited, Sat Mar 12 19:43:10 2005 | Chest/Documents spawned at 71,51 for me. | Subject: ""Found it""
For those who dont have cosmos the footlocker is under the eastermost dock off Theramore Isle. Had to sneak by water all the way to it, but fortunately there was only one shark there.

Hope that helps"

1204,Mudrock Soup and Bugs,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1204,"Subject: ""Everything you need to know...""
Ok, here's an all encompassing post with everything you need to know to complete the Mudrock Soup and Bugs (Forked Mudrock Tongue) quest.

I solo'ed this quest as a full fire spec level 37 human mage. The tongues drop rate is not very high, but the quest is not hard at all, and the level 35-40 Mudrock Tortoises/Burrowers/Spikeshells are quite easy to kill.

Receiving the quest:

Go to the Mage's Quarter in Stormwind, and enter the Blue Recluse pub. You will get a quest called 'Morgan Stern' from a barman.

Travel to the Wetlands, then take the boat on your left side as you face the ocean to Theramore.

Once in Theramore, find the inn at 66, 45 (Northmost point of Theramore) and speak with Morgan. He will complete the quest, and you will begin the Mudrock Soup and Bugs quest. You will get 700 experience for completing this part of the quest, and 28 Stormwind experience.

Directions:

To get to the Dreadmurk Shore (where the tortoise are) go to co-ordinates 64, 41.

If you do not have co-ordinates, as soon as you leave Theramore and cross the bridge, take a sharp right until you hit the beach. North, up the beach, you will find the Mudrocks.

Drop rate:

I killed 19 Mudrocks to get the 8 tongues needed. Each Mudrock gave an average of 230 experience (I am level 37). This experience adds up to: 4370 experience.

Bonus:

If you go about 61, 27 (halfway up the shore), and look across the sea, there is a little Mirefin hut surrounded by about 5 Mirefins. At my time there, there was a chest. The hut is a chest spawn point, so check if there is one. If there is, you will have to kill 1 Mirefin on his own infront of the hut, and 2 at once who defend the chest. Then, reap the rewards. I received (among some foods) 'Formula: Enchant Shield - Stamina'.

Alternative directions:

You do not have to go to the beach to get the Mudrocks. Instead of taking a sharp right out of Theramore, take a sharp left and you get to a bay with alot of tiny islands. There are Mudrock Burrowers around there, but I don't advise doing the quest here, as there are also some level 40 beasts which cause some annoyance. Co-ords for this are 62, 47.

Experience total:

Stormwind -> Theramore (Speak with Morgan): 700exp
Killing Mudrocks: 4370
Quest completion: 2850

Total experience: 7920

Reputation total:

Stormwind -> Theramore (Speak with Morgan): 28 rep
Quest completion: 275 rep

Total reputation: 303

(Please remember all this is based on me being level 37. If you are less than 37, you will probably get more, and if you are higher you will probably get less).

Have fun. | Subject: ""The sharks""
I was out here last night doing some grinding and spotting for a 33 Druid just in case they got into trouble when 46Elite Coral Shark came out of the water and aggro'd the Druid. We ran up onto a hill over the beach, and sure enough the thing was fully out of the water and on the beach as we watched it search around for us. I didn't think they'd actually leave the water, but they do and I wished that I'd gotten a screenshot of it. A rare occurance I would guess, but keep your eyes open and don't afk near the edge of the water in this area.

Erm, I remember when I did this quest that I got a crappy drop rate too, around 50 kills to get the 8 tongues. Maybe some servers give better drop rates than others on these mobs? | Head up and down the coast North of Theramore. The turtles are level 36-37, and the droprate is fairly low, so you'll be killing a lot of them.

They do drop the Thick Scaly Tails and Speckled Shell Fragments, though, so it's not all that bad of a grind. They're gray, but they sell for a decent amount to vendors."
1205,Deadmire,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1205,"Look for a large white crocolisk roaming the rivers of the Quagmire or the Dragonmurk. He has a pretty big patrol route, so you will likely be doing some running. He's level 45, non-elite, so finding him is the hardest part of the quest.

And if you forget where to turn this in, the guy is on Hunter Rise in Thunder Bluff. | The stretch of river leading north/northeast from STONEMAUL RUINS on your map is where you need to be, he swims up and down that. He is a huge brute, a dull white crocodile that is unmistakable, just check the screen and you'll not miss him. Easily found with Track Beasts as a Hunter.

47, 56 is where he met his end for me. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
he is a massive white croc. as u can't miss him. he stick out badly. just stay around the big pool just north of the dragonkin. it has a tiny island with a pool inside it. then u know ur at right place. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
got him at 47,61"

It's because you have already done the other pre-quest that send you to start this chain.

You either start it with:
'They Call Him Smiling Jim' in Theramore Isle
or
'James Hyal' in Stormwind City  James Hyal you can not get/complete both.

Both of them end up sending you to Captain Garran Vines that points you to the Shady Rest Inn, where you can get the following quests that follow this chain by 3 items at the burned inn:
- The Black Shield:  The Black Shield Suspicious Hoofprints:  Suspicious Hoofprints Lieutenant Paval Reethe:  Lieutenant Paval Reethe | Subject: ""The point is to send you to Dustwallow""
There is no follow up directly, but the point is for newer players who don't know the zones well enough to know where to go next.  This is one of those quests that's along the same lines as ""hey, go talk to Captain Numbnuts in this other zone.""  You're supposed to go there and then see that there's a bunch more quests to do, but in most cases the person you're sent to usually has some quests of his own.  This time he doesn't.

You get it just before you get on the boat, you turn it in when you get off.  It's free XP, what more do you want? | Subject: ""Experience/Reputation""

      I would side with the Gelkis just because it's much easier to kill the Magram for rep or quests. The Gelkis are mostly in that cave (oh, how I hate that cave!) and the huge hole in the ground that's hard to kill in. Magrams have water in their camp true, but all the more reason to pick them.

Gelkis are at  39.90 at Desolace | I read through the advice given for both chains, and considered the gear rewards, but to be honest, what is most important is the XP, right? Naturally, the Alliance scum get more in the chain (typical Blizzard) than the awesome Horde with the faction introduction quests.

(Alliance)
Brutal Politics - 2,050xp
Assault - 2,550xp
or
Strange Alliance - 2,050xp
Raid on the Kolkar - 2,550xp

(Horde)

Broken Tears - 2,650xp
Gizmo for Warug - 2,050xp

Khan Hratha - 4,300xp and this or this

Total = 12, 510xp - but costs the price of one Advanced Target Dummy server dependant (1gold 30silver on my server - not worth 500xp)

Basically, Alliance scum get more XP than Hord regardless of the chain you pick, or if you're crazy and grind back rep to do both chains. Magram rewards an extra 500xp, but you'll need to pay out some cash for it, so factor this into your choice.

Every Magram I killed was worth 20 rep with the other clan.  You can watch your rep by going to character info/reputation and watching the points add up.  Took me 80 kills to get from 1400 to 3000, and it didn't matter what centaurs I killed.

They are based around 65,80

Funny thing is, they just let you walk up to them and start smacking away.  Even when your rep goes to unfriendly, it's hard to aggro.

BTW, since you have to kill about 40 magram, get ""Centaur Bounty"" befor you start. Might as well be collecting centaur ears as you go along. | If you are too high level you get only 4 rep instead of 20, could take some time to begin the quest chain then... | Subject: ""Exactly what to do""
You need to go to 73,73 on the desolace map.

Both magram and gelkis suck, so just do the gelkis alliance.Thats why:
1.Gelkis have better rewards.
2.They have more sensible quests, as uthek is aiding her tribe while warug is just plain stupid and mean.
3.Magram are actually easier to kill.Just watch for the pack runners.
4.Gelkis chests in their caves you can loot when you are friendly with them.

All in all, centaurs suck. | Subject: ""And My Alliance With You Ends Here...""
    ...Really. Warug asks for some stupid thing only skilled Engineers can make. I got mine by spamming the Trade Chat, and when I saw that after giving him the damned thing, he wanted me to kill some Khan, I just stopped. Sure I dd the next one but geez, what a lazy bum :D.
    If you want to stop here in this chain, it would be sensible. However, after leaving the Magram I saw that I had to go to STV. I didn't want to, so I clicked 'At War' on the Magram Rep Bar and turned around and started killing them.

From Desolace, walk/ride/fly in your most direct route to Auberdine, Darkshore (alliance) or Ratchet, Barrens (alliance or horde).

Auberdine: Take the boat to Menethil. Fly/walk to Ironforge, then fly/tram to Stormwind. Fly/walk south east to Duskwood, and from Darkshire (town) go east through Deadwind Pass then south-east along the roads to Swamp of Sorrows.

Ratchet: Boat to Booty Bay in Stranglethorn Vale, then walk/ride up to Duskwood. Avoid the guards if horde and take Deadwind Pass through to Swamp of Sorrows.

There may be a better route from STV to SoS that doesn't involve going through alliance ground, but I'm alliance so I didn't look into it much. I just saw the only feasible way to SoS is DWP, which is accessible from Duskwood.

Alliance: if you can't avoid/survive Barrens Guards, take the long menethil route, especially if you have all the FP's I meantioned. Its safe and familiar. | Subject: ""61,20""
Coords are precise. For those who don't have Cosmos (missing out big time), simply follow the road to the left when it forks until you get to Fallow Sanctuary. He's near the back of this place near a campfire. If you have a class that can stealth, this quest is easy.

Khan jhen is still bugged, BUT :

As an earlier poster said , start meleeing him. After some time ( approx 2 min for me ) he started attacking back. HP werent dropping on him, at least not in the target window.

Keep hitting him, with spell and sword, whatever you like - he WILL die.

For me he stayed in the tent and fell dead there. Dumb thing was I was outside when he died, following the *WRONG* advice of some other posters.

So the corpse is out of range to loot.

THE TRICK :
As this has apparently to do with a lag issue , I thought, lets relog.
And BINGO , after relogging khan jhen was on his final resting place outside of the tent for me. I looted the corpse and went my way.

So relogging when you cant loot him might help you as well !

Everyone starts with 2000/3000 neutral with both centaur clans.  Each kill is +20/-100 rep if they give exp and +4/-100 rep otherwise.  Bosses (there is only 1 of each clan) get you +25/-125 rep if they give exp and +5/-125 otherwise.
You become KoS with one clan after 20 kills, slightly faster if you kill the named.  To get friendly you would need 1000 rep which is also 20 exp kills but to get the 1000 rep from no exp kills takes 500!  IMHO you will be grinding rep for a lot of different factions in the end so there is no point burning out early by faction grinding near useless centaurs. | Subject: ""Magram Location""
You can find the magram on the other side of the kodo graveyard: 65,76 | Subject: ""pick one quest or the other""
It might technically be possible to do both this quest and Brutal Politics...

Both quests are chains ending at about lvl 42, and you must retain your reputation with your chosen clan to complete them. F.or each kill you gain 20 rep with the opposing clan and lose 100 rep with the clan you killed. So to complete one quest and then try to reverse your reputation with the other clan to complete the other quest would not only take more kills than the first but would also be a waste of time since you would already have exceeded the level of the quest. After reviewing each chain of quests to the end, I have chosen this quest for several reasons.

1. the Gelkis are enroute to Feralas, and the Magram are easily avoidable. I didn't want to compromise future travel

2. you can collect Centaur ears from the Magrams to complete the quest Centuar Bounty

3. this quest will not cost me money or have any hard to obtain items as certain aspects of Brutal Politics does

4. Although the end reward for this quest is not usuable for my character it will fetch more cash (almost twice as much) in the end & I already have better equipment than the reward for the other quest.

So I suggest reading through the forums for the quests yourself and then decide which one you might want to do.

p.s. I read somewhere on one of these quests that you can open your Reputation Menu (K) and uncheck ""at war"" with your unfriendly clan and they won't attack you. I haven't tried this yet, but it's worth a shot.

If you look at Magram Village, there is a small island with tents on it. Looking at the map, draw a straight line north from the island.

1389,Draenethyst Crystals,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1389,"This quest can be deceptively difficult. You only have to harvest crystals from the big crystal formations found throughout the Draeni village called The Fallow Sanctuary. It's the area in the north-northeast of the zone. I found that the Draeni character models blend VERY well with the surrounding swamp, so what looks like an easy one-on-one kill can become two-on-one or even three-on-one. It doesn't help that the mobs are level 37-38.

If you have the patience and want to play it extremely safe, you will usually find one or two crystal formations with only one nearby mob. Just loot those and wait on a respawn.

Due to the fact that the Draeni blend in, and they tend to run when their health is low, you can end up with some very nasty fights, so it's not a bad idea to bring one or two friends for backup.

You can accomplish much more than this quest in this area, though. If you are allied with the Gelkis centaur in Desolace, one of their later quests sends you to retrieve a gem from Ongeku, who is found in the northwestern part of the village. Near him you can find a caged human that starts an escort quest. Finally there is a rare spawn chieftan that tends to spawn near Ongeku. | Subject: ""actually....""
I found the crystals on the northern road around 55,27 and they don't drop from something, you pick them up.  Beginning/end of this quest is at 25,31 ish | Subject: ""do multiple quests at once!""
These crystals look like giant Lesser Moonstones (turqoise crystals, can't miss 'em) jutting out of the ground near the Forsaken encampment.  They spawn pretty quickly, so just get the easy ones at the western edge of the encampment if you're solo.

For another quest in this immediate area, go to the eastern edge of the encampment and pick up the escort quest from the NPC in the cage (a group is recommended for this one).  He is right next to the broken wagon where you get the supplies that the other NPC (in SW part of map) wanted (after you do the kill spiders, crocs, etc quest).

You may also find a supply box on the water's edge.  This starts an (Alliance only?) delivery quest that is really easy (you have to go to Nethergarde anyway).  Be sure and get the gryph point, to the right and up the wooden tower from the turn-in NPC in Nethergarde."

Noboru is the mon that drops the club/mace... right click on it for the quest (try to equip it basically)...

He wanders randomly in the swamp but his main base is the small island just north of Horde Stonard... the tent is smoking that may be what appears to be a campfire...

(it is the same island tent that you have to go to get the box from the escort quest of th ehuman that was in a cage in the refuge)

You take the mace, after you right-click it to launch the quest, to the stationary NPC named Matgoor in the nw corner os SoS... as soon as you come in the zone from Red Ridge area head north into 26,31 coords (i think its called Misty Valley)... then you give it to him and it triggers second part of quest to get crystals from the lost ones...

Crystals are not dropped - they are huge and are in the refuge village area... you can't miss them, this is a good time to get the escort quest... then you return the (6?) crystals to complete at the same time you are escorting the human out of the swamp since it is the same direction and his escort quest completes before the Matgoor camp...

Note: good time to do the ""...Bugs"" quest... you go straight through the lost ones camp at the Refuge and to the coast... kill the crabs Silt ones and Huge ones all drop the legs you need. | Subject: ""Only once""
Though you can kill Noboru more than once (and probably will as you wander the area), the cudgel will only drop once. Incidentally to ""activate"" the quest, you need to right click on the cudgel once it's in your inventory. This will bind it to you and allow you to turn in the quest.

if you waited too long to go deliver them, the crate of stones will disappear from your inventory. Just go abandon the quest and go back to the guy in Darkshire to get the quest again. I recommend, running to Nethergarde Keep first, take a gryphon back to Darkshire, accept the quest, then fly right back.

I did this quest without a FP in five minutes. Take Deadwind pass and just keep to the main road so the birds won't attack. Then when you hit SoS, hang a right at Splinterspear Junction, then the next right after that. Follow that road into the Blasted Lands until it opens up in front of you and you see the level 45+ animals. Go left and follow the road as it turns back north. Voila, Nethergarde Keep!

The only thing that you may have to fight is a couple of orc scouts in SoS, but I was mounted and just out ran them. Easy XP in this one. | The crate of stones expires after a certain period of time, just pick it up again in Darkshire.

I read the stones have 60 min timer.
That is enough for walking or mount.
When you receive quest, just walk to east, and you see Deadwind pass. Keep at left side, this road is 100% mob free. Then you're already by Swamp of Sorrow. Follow the road, but you shall see some mobs walking around. Try avoid them.
Keep running on the way to Stonard (keep at right side of the roads)
Then you see the way to right, follow it now.
When you're in The Blasted Lands, you see a mine at left side. Walk up the hill to the mine, named Garrison Armory. You see the castle Nethergarde Keep already. Walk there. No mobs risks are here.
Between big buildings, at right side of the small tower, you see him. Walk now more to right, behind the big building, you see fly master.
(I have running with mount the road little more south and then left to the Keep. The mob risk is little higher, but it's also possible. But just passing the mine at left is sure 100% mob free.) | Subject: ""XP""

This quest really isn't worth the time!  It's good in the sense that it makes you discover the Badlands so that you can start questing over there but it's nearly impossible to find all of the passes to get there on your own.  If it weren't for guildies I'd still be wandering around.  Best I can say is take the port in Booty Bay (if you can't do it go to Org. engineer and get the quest for it so you can use the port), get out of Gnom. and then just follow the road towards Loch Mordan.  It's a long hike - just keep following the signs towards Loch.  You'll eventually end up at mountains and an entrance to your left - never being in that area before I wasn't sure if it was the entrance to Loch or what.  You won't get ganked my alliance if you go in - it's a pass through the mountain.  Once you get through you'll just follow the road to another pass.  Take that and then follow the road til it T's - Loch won't be on the signs anymore but head to the left up the hill.  You won't go too far up and it will say you discovered Loch.  The pass to get to the Badlands is at 48,69.  Nothing too high level so you don't have to worry about getting mauled.  Once you FINALLY find the Badlands follow along side the mountains to the north all the way to the west and there you will find the horde camp of Kargath.  The coords for Kargath are around 4,46 and Neeka is all the way up the tower (at the second level up).  I really hope this helps someone! | Subject: ""The way to Badlands""

Alright guys, I will share some information so you could find them quicker.  I hope you can do the same when you know more.

This is four spawn-locations I know of;
1. 29,51
2. 33,47
3. 29,38
4. 43,34

I delivered 4 crates in 15 minutes, and 5 crates after 1.5 hours. This means I didn't find another spawn-location and someone picked it before I did so I find the fourth at one of my known locations.

*Edit:
Found another location:
5. 37,37 | Subject: ""SW HONOUR POINT QUEST ONLY.""
SW HONOUR POINT QUEST ONLY.
The Lost Supply quest has that single purpose to give you honour points with SW and nothing more. Before you reach lvl 46 you do get 25 rep points per crate! You can start The Lost Supply quest at lvl 30. It does only give you a small amount of xp the first time you hand it in.
- - -

And the day came when I, a gnome mage (lvl 43), finally got my horse.

I started this character whit the purpose to get exhalted with SW to get a horse. To make it a little easier to myself I headed to Elwyn Forest when I reached lvl 5. From that moment did I only do SW related quests.

I tried to start the crate collection at lvl 30. However it was too difficult at this low lvl with all the critters being lvl 35-40. So I went out and levelled up to 35 and went back. Again I had to give up � the beatings were to much all the time. I simply agroed everything in sight!
Once again I had to leave SoS disappointed. I went out and took all available quests and got myself to lvl 40. I even bought my mechanostrider which I really do recommend all who has the 100G needed - the regular run speed simply is to slow!

Now everything was a lot easier. I printed out a map of SoS and marked the crate spawn place every time I found one. However after a while I did not need the map anymore. I quickly found a path around in SoS from one spawn place to the next. And by using this same path over and over again I could quickly scout through the whole area. You do also learn all the critters position very fast.
Note: it is possible to cross the water several places without getting dis-mounted.

Here are all the details you will need:

Honour points from neutral to exhalted:
Neutral: 0/3.000
Friendly: 0/6.000
Honoured: 0/12.000
Revered: 0/21.000
Total: 42.000 after this you get 0/1000 but those are not needed to get the horse!)

QUEST END POINT:
All the crates are to be handed in to Quartermaster Lungertz.
He is situated in Nethergarde Keep in Blasted Lands (coordinates 66,21).

CRATE SPAWN PLACES:
All the crates have a random respawn.

Misty Valley:
(Critters: Swampwalkers lvl 38-40)
09,29
12,34
14,38
04,31 (cave with Mire Lord lvl 42)

Swamp area:
(Critters: Sawtooth Crocolish, Sorrow Spinner and Swamp Jaguars lvl 35-37)
29,38
29,50
33,45
37,36
43,33
45,35

Fallow Sanctuary:
(Critters: Lost ones lvl 34-39)
54,30
56,24
59,21
60,21
62,22
64,20

All together I did collect between 900 and 930 crates. I gained 3 lvls during the project.
From all the reward boxes I got 5 blue items, around 320 greater healing potions, loads of herbs for alchemy and around 25G in total. (The gold amount does not count in selling any items).

For the shore, you'll find Flesheater/Oracle between 94, 25 and 94, 60. The Flesheaters seem to be more likely to spawn than the Oracles, so all the (I think, three maybe four) spawns for the Oracles get clogged up sometimes.

Also take note that any of these rocs have a chance of dropping a  Giant Egg, which is a requirement for the 225+ cooking quest. That makes it quite popular on the auction house (selling for ~50s a piece on my server at the time of writing).

To complete this quest you will need:
72x Copper Bar
12x Linen Cloth
6x Weak Flux | Subject: ""Very important""
You must be Blacksmith with skill 30+ to get Quest | Subject: ""Loc""
Thorvald Deepforge is located in Loch Modan at 24,74."
1579,Gaffer Jacks,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1579,"Subject: ""The rock at 36 , 42""
its probably just a coincidence, but the only time I was ever able to catch these damn things was while I was fishing off a rock near the northern exit to the auberdine inn. Tried other places nothing, kept coming back here and every other catch was a gaffer. Anybody else try this spot? | Subject: ""about 10 to 15 minutes""
Took the advice here and fished from the rock just outside the northern door of the inn. I caught:

7 Mackerel
4 Rainbow fin albacore
3 Oily blackmouth
4 Darkshore groupers

and

8 Gaffer Jacks

that makes a drop ratio of about two to one.

BTW. I was at lvl 75 by the time I started fishing | Subject: ""Level for quest""
You got to have 30 in fishing skill to get the quest, but you need luck to get all Gaffer Jacks quickly.

I read about a dranei how had to train for skill 150 to get it. That could be a rest of early problems for dranei to get various quest.

A good place to fish is outside the inn. If you stand on the right place you are even restig! :-)

Tips]
Rise your skill in cooking with all the extra fish. You can buy recipie for Slitherskin Mackerel close to Teldrassils FP and for Rainbow Fin Albacore by the fisher man who stands above the beach a short walk south of Auberdine | Subject: ""All 8 in under 15 mins!""
Go to the tiny island just south of the Auberdine dock. You'll know you're on the right island when you see a campfire and a broken down house.

I fished on the western side of this island and retrieved all 8 gaffer jacks in less than 15 minutes.

Good luck! ^_^ | Subject: ""skill level""
I leveled my fishing starting at 20 and running back to this guy every 5 points or so.

He was offering the quest somewhere between fishing skill 35 and 41. | Subject: ""Where to Fish""
I fished off the dock in Auberdine where the boat comes in from Menethil.  Drop rate was terrible for first two Jacks, then changed to 1 drop about every 4-5 casts. Takes a bit, experience ok/hour... | Looks like you need a fishing skill of at least 35.
I did this on a character around level 20 not realizing it was there and having done The Family And The Fishing Pole, later on an alt i was unable to obtain this quest and couldn't figure out why, thinking i needed to finish the above mentioned quest and that not being the case i then thought maybe i needed to finish all of the Buzzbox quests i was confused to find out that this was NOT the case. Eventually i think i saw someone mention you needed a certain fishing skill level and i tested it out and this does appear to be the case. Hopefully this information can help someone else who is also confused to save time and frustration."

1667,Dead-tooth Jack,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1667,"Subject: ""Tactic for killing Jack and Co.""
After much trial and much more errors, I have come upon a tactic that can help you beat this quest.
#1: Find the camp. It's hard to kill Jack if you can't find him. If you need help, read all the posts above this one.
#2: Kills those wolves and Defias around the camp. You do not want them to be accidently aggro'd in the fight against Jack. Trust me. It has happened to me. And make sure you kill that one guard to the right of Jack without aggro'ing him. That would be bad.
#3: After you kill all those pesky guards and wolves, charge at Jack's lone guard and kill him. You might be wondering, ""Why the guard? Why not Jack himself?"" Simple. I found out the hard way that Jack has an insanely fast respawn time. So fast that you can see him walk on his own corpse. While you're fighting the guard, you might want to throw in a thunder clap in there somewhere to slow Jack's attacks.
#4: After you killed the guard, hamstring Jack and run the heck away. Since you already killed all those defias and wolves, nothing will interfere will your running away. Also, you might want to switch into Defensive stance here just to be safe.
#5: Did you get away from Jack? You did? Great! Now rest up and go back there and kill him.
#5b: Did you get away from Jack? You didn't? Oh well. At least you'll be fighting Jack one-on-one now. So get res'd and go kill him!
#6: After you kill him, spit on him for making you go through so much pain and agony. Ok, this step may not be necessary, but I think everyone is going to do it nonetheless.
#7: Get the key off of Jack and unlock the box. Take the badge.
#8: Turn the quest in.
#9: Be happy. You just beaten this annoying as hell quest. | Location 89, 78 | Subject: ""Coords (aprox.)""

1681,Ironband's Compound,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1681,"Subject: ""coord""
You find the ore in a lockbox at 78,62 in Ironband's Compound (south of Helm's Bed Lake) in the house in the back in the basement. The box is protected by Captain Beld, lvl 11 non-elite. The other mobs around are lvl 8 to 9. | Just as the quest details, Ironband's Compound is just southwest of Helm's Bed Lake, which is on the Eastern side of Dun Morogh.

When you approach the compound, you'll notice a building on the south side. this is where the Umbral Ore is located. Dark Iron Spies are spaced wide enough apart that you can pull each one individually.

After making your way inside of the building, you'll find Captain Beld located in the basement. He is standing right next to a chest that contains the Umbral Ore. Beware, as soon as he sees you, he will charge you, so any rush attacks will have to be quick. Once Captain Beld is killed, simply open the chest and retreive the ore.

For those of you with Cosmos or Titan Panel add-ons, the coordinates are 77,62 for the chest.

Note: The quest ""The Public Servant"" pairs will with this quest, since Rockjaw Bonesnappers are also found in front of the compound. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=433) | Subject: ""rewards""

right off the docks (facing the water, head to the end of them and go left/south), piece of cake. | Subject: ""Easy once you find the ship""
The ship and Shade of Elura are at 32,45.  For those without the cosmos, go down the dock from Auberdine, turn left where the boat to Menethril would be docked and jump in the water.

Shade of Elura ('ghost girl') is wondering around the bottom of the ocean by the ship - around the center of the wreck.  She may be hard to see but once you spot her, be sure to click on her so that you can spot her again easily even if you have to come up for the air before you go back in to attack.

Crates of ore you'll find all over the ocean floor around the ship.  I found a bunch of them to the East of the ship - 33,46 | Subject: ""description""
As everyone else has said if you go to the end of the pier where you would get the ship to Menethil. Jump off there and swim down.
The ghost is easy to beat but watch out for the creatures down there.
As for the crates they are a pain to find.
Swim around the area, as if heading for the shore, you should find them.

It is worth pointing out that if I hadn't checked on here I wouldn't have had a clue. The description for the quest sucks."

1698,Yorus Barleybrew,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1698,"Subject: ""Quest run through""
Okay, here's the run down of the lvl20 warrior quest (Alliance side). There are two things you need to know about this quest, firstly is that this is a LOOOONG series of quests and will take you about a day to complete (if you do them all). Secondly is that YOU CANNOT DO THESE SOLO. Unfortunately for most they only realise this when they are further down the line, the mobs that you need to kill for the Fire Hardened armor quests are lvl28+. However, if you do manage to complete all the quests then at the end you will end up with:

Furen's Favor (shield)
Fire Hardened Hauberk (chest)
Fire Hardened Leggings (legs)
Fire Hardened Coif (head)
Fire Hardened Gauntlets (gloves)

Note: The only stuff really useful in the above list is the Hauberk, I myself was using it mid to late 30s because not much drops thats better than this. Green Iron Hauberk (smithy crafted) is what I upgraded to when I could make it. Also, the Fire Hardened items are not a set so there are no extra bonuses.

Quest 1: Yorus Barleybrew

Simple enough. To pick up this quest talk to Wu Shen the Warrior Trainer in Stormwind, Old Town district near the SI:7 building. From here he will give you this quest and send you to Redridge, Lakeshire Inn to talk to Yorus.

Quest 2: The Rethban Gauntlet

This quest can be easy or hard, its luck of the draw. You have to run into a cave then get back without being killed. The cave is in the North West of Redridge, head West from Lakeshire until you hit the mountains then follow them North past a Gnoll Camp. You head round the corner at a big rock and into the cave, 10 secs into the cave you come to a fork and you get the 'Complete' message and then have to run back. If you die then you have to start the quest again by talking to Yorus.

Sometimes if someone has been questing then all the Gnolls in the area are dead. This IS soloable. You have an hour to do the run, which is a ridiculous amount of timem I've ran it there and back and completed the quest in 3 mins. You dont have to rush, you can kill your way to the cave instead of running past them and aggroing everything.

When you've completed the quest he gives you a quick hip hip hooray and then gives you the next quest.

Quest 3: The Shieldsmith

Here you have to head back to Stormwind and talk to Furen Longbeard and give him the Cask that Yorus gave you. He's located in the Dwarven District by the main forge.

When you complete the quest you will get the Furen's Favor shield. He will then give you your next quest.

Quest 4: Fire Hardened Mail

Now comes the hard part, here you are going to need help from a guildie, a friend or a anyone who can solo Razorfen Kraul in The Barrens.

Furen gives you a list of ingredients to make the Fire Hardened Hauberk:

1) 50x Scorched Spider Fang
2) 12x Charred Horn
3) 1x Galvanized Horn
4) 1x Vial of Phlogiston

1) The Scorched Spider Fangs drop from the Cave Stalker/Leech Stalker spiders (lvl 16-22) outside and inside the cave near Dun Algaz in ther Wetlands (the tunnel leading from Loch Modan to the Wetlands). This is pretty much the only part of the quest you can solo.

2) The Charred Horns drop from Fledgling Chimaera (lvl 20 - 27) and Young Chimaera (lvl 19 - 25) in the Charred Vale in Stonetalon (North West of The Barrens) near the southern point of the Vale before going into Desolace. Quite a busy are with lots of mobs.

3) The Galvanized horn drops from The Chimaera Matriarch (lvl 26 - 28) who is in the same area, she flies around on a flight path near the Chimaera so you should come across her sooner or later.

4) The Vial of Phlogiston is located on Roogug (lvl 27 - 28 ELITE) who is one of the sub bosses in Razorfen Kraul (Instance to the south of the Barrens before the Great Lift leading to Thousand Needles). BE CAREFUL! There are TWO instances right across from each other, Razorfen Kraul and Razornfen Downs, facing the lift you want RFK which is on your right (the West instance on the zone map). When in the instance finding Roofug can be tricky, if my directions are right then as you enter the dungeon take your first left, follow the path around and follow it over a big long vine that take you to an uper level. You should come to a place with a big cauldron, he's just around the corner. Its hard to find groups for RFK as it is (Alliance side), so you prolly are gonna need someone who can solo the instance.

Note: Easiest way to The Barrens is to either get a boat from Menethil (Wetlands) to Theramore Isle (Dustwallow Marsh) then run west into The Barrens. Alternatively you can run south from Darkshirt into Stranglthorn Vale, head along the road to the very south (prolly only thing attacking you will be a few tigers and gorrillas near the paths, but nothing SHOULD kill you). Head to Booty Bay then catch the ship to Ratchett which is in the Barrens.

Once you have all the ingrediants then return to Furen and he will make you the Firehardened Hauberk (he will make it then you have to talk to him again to recieve it).

Now its been a while since I've done this next bit so I cant remember whether Furen tells you to go and talk to the next three people, or whether they just become activated after you complete the quest. It seems like you get given Furen's Notes for another quest giver which is determined by your chars race, either way this leads you to another three quests (which you can do in any order as long as you have completed the Fire Hardened Hauberk quest, but I have given them in order of conveniance to get to).

1799,Fragments of the Orb of Orahil,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1799,"Do not be mislead by this quest, and read it carefully. It is stated that you need an Infernal Orb, but you don't get the orb from and Infernal you get it from the warlocks, Burning Blade Summoner's (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=4668). The drop rate is about 55%, I got it on my second kill because I am an unlucky person. Also, after you get this quest, she tells you to talk to her Acolytes behind her. They give you two options either ""Shard of a Felhound"" (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4962) or ""Shard of an Infernal"" (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4963).

If you go the route of the Felhound you get to choose from a Shadow damage staff, or a Shadow damage Orb. Otherwise, the route of the Infernal gives you a Fire damage Staff, or a Fire damage Orb.

But first, you need to cleanse the orb, and you don't want to turn anything in before hand because you will fail the quest forever (unless they fixed that finally). To do that you have to head to Dustwallow Marsh to find Tabetha (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=6546), ** Remember her location, she is used for future quests**. Tabetha will have you fight a level 40 Elite Felguard, which is possible at level 36 if you constantly fear it while putting Damage over Time spells on him, and have your Void Walker out. | Subject: ""FFS..""
FFS, why do people not realise that +dmg is so vitally important for warlocks?  Warlocks do not need the mana and health pool that mages and priests need (dont get me wrong, its hugely important, but for those of us affliction specced we get an instant full mana regen, and for those that dont there is still good old life tap.  on top of that, our shadow bolt takes a while to churn through all your mana in the first place).

the staves from this quest are far better than illusionary rod for us, because it adds dmg to our dots and spells.  If you are worried about the loss of int, but a +int enchant.  If you have spell power increase buffs, things die faster.  that means levelling faster, and less spells cast (therefore the int is less important.... takes less casting to kill things so you dont need the int as much) so you save time all round.  Plus for those who dont like travelling, we have to go to these places eventually anyway, may as well make it now while they are exciting for your level.

If you can get a staff of jordan dont bother with this quest its not worth it.  for those without the money to buy an epic, do bother, because you will use this until you get soul harvester at lvl 50. | Subject: ""Clearing Up The Confusion (my confusion at least :P)""
  First off... there's NO way to ""break"" this quest line (aside from accidentally destroying the ruby/emerald once it's infused). Period!
  I only read the quest from Menara ONCE when I first accepted it.  So, by the time I obtained the infused ruby thingy and the infernal orb, I had forgotten the part about Tabetha cleansing the orb and Menara's ""warning"" not to return until I completed BOTH tasks.  So, after obtaining the felhound soul shard and the infernal orb, I returned to Ratchet and gave Menara the ruby and the felhound soul shard BEFORE taking the infernal orb to Tabetha to be cleansed.  I did not read everything she had to say before I clicked 'complete'.  I only caught something like ""...and not before then"" before I realised I hadn't recieved a reward (orb or staff).  So I freaked out and came here to see what went wrong.  That's when I read all the posts about losing the quest(s), not being able to get them back and not being able to get the orb/staff reward.  I was PISSED!  Actually lost some sleep over it (yes, I know - pathetic).  Well, went to Tabetha and cleansed the orb today.  Returned to Menara, turned in the cleansed orb and got the staff - WOOT!  Moral of the story?  It doesn't matter if you turn in the felhound/infernal soul shard BEFORE or AFTER you have the infernal orb cleansed!  End of story. | Subject: ""Tabetha's tloc location""
Tabetha is located at 46,57 in a rather rough area of the marsh, so be careful.... | Tabetha's hut is located at 46,57"

Ok here is what I find.. Putting in time to figure this out.  No its not a bug but requires patiences, talk to the Jennea Cannon for the quest - Investigate the Blue Recluse quest.

1. Get the Cantation of Manifestation &  Chest of Containment Coffers (10 charges) from the table behind her.

2. So soon you get out of the mage tower, jump down and you will see 'Blue Recluse' inn, go in then go to the basement.

3. Use your Cantation of Manifestation (Its a 5 minute timer between the spawn each time you use it.) - It does not matter how you hurt it, just beat it down until you see the spiral on its head.

4. Use the Chest of Containment Coffers once the riff is stunned (spirl on its head), then it will say - 'Rift Spawn is sucked into the coffers', then as soon its gone, click on the coffers and it will then be in your inventory.

5. Repeat/Rinse #3 5 minutes later until you get 3 necessary coffers, then you're done..

Good luck.. | Subject: ""Very easy if done right.""
As a previous poster said, start in the basement, all the way down.  You'll only get one.

Next, stand by the chef in the kitchen.  One should spawn right by the fire.

Finally, go to the top of the stairs in the common room.  Stand in the middle of the balcony and summon again.  You'll only get one.

If you use the scroll in the common room or inside the front door, you're screwed.  Be careful and it's easy to solo at 16. | Took me some time to figure this out:
Accept Quest  Investigate the Blue Recluse
Collect items  Chest of Containment Coffers &  Cantation of Manifestation right on the table next to the quest NPC
Get out of tower
Blue Recluse Tavern is on your right when you come out of the tower (southern mage quarter)
Go into Blue Recluse Tavern
Run around and spam  Arcane Explosion until you see a Rift Spawn
DPS it down.
Once it reaches 1 hp, it will get stunned automatically.
Use  Chest of Containment Coffers
Sing ""GHOSTBUSERS! Theme""
Loot the  Filled Containment Coffer on the ground
Note: I recommend to start in the cellar and move up. There are multiple Rift Spawn next to each other next to the bar and 1st floor. They are level 17 and hit hard, they break free of nova quite fast. If you aggro multiple you might die. Bring a friend.
Last edited by dasbaum on 2019/09/05 | ok... if you stay on the main floor and use the cantation you're going to get Pwned. Deal with the first one alone.

Go to the basement and use the cantation which will only summon one. once you've done this, kill the sucker, use your chest of containment coffers and finally click on the filled containment coffer.

Go to the main floor and you should be able to handle the two remaining. | The Chest of Containment Coffers and Cantation of Manifestation are on the table behind Jennea. Make sure to pick them up before heading off the the Blue Recluse. | I went to the basement, and just 1 summoned, which was easy to kill and contain. Then I went to the main floor and summoned and 3 showed up, promptly kicking my butt. I rezzed and came back, went to the basement and summoned 1 again - no problem, got it. Then I went up on the top floor and tried summoning. Three showed up again! So, I ran and at least didn't die. Then I got the brilliant idea to log out and log back in. Went to the basement and just 1 summoned.

So, I think you can go to the basement, get 1, log out and back in, and go to the basement and get 1 again. Much easier to handle as a mage than having 3 on you at once. | Subject: ""Broken Now""

Just to say it again, you do not have to kill the boss.  Go to the top and there is a bookshelf opposite the room of him.  There is an obvious book sticking out.  That is the one you want.

Just a heads up, the end reward for all your hard work is utter crap.  See the next part of the quest on thottbot for my links. | Subject: ""Easy""
It's easy...
Not in a group
Not as arcane mage
Not at lvl 32+
Just plain easy...

Don't know why anybody didn't try it...

I did it with a 27 mage and it goes like this:

1. Fight ur way up (not that hard).
2. At the top stay on the stairs, don't go all the way up, make sure u know where the book is (on a shelf, not anywhere near the boss)
3. U'll see a gnoll caster and two dogs next to it, polymorph the caster.
4. The dogs will come to you (you're still on the stairs), frost nova them when they're in melee range.
5. To be sure use mana shield and grab the book and leave, if you keep refreshing the shield you probably won't die, not even if all the other mobs respawned.

Note: When u frost nova the dogs, make sure they're out line of sight when grabbing the book, they'll use ranged when they can't move and they are out of melee range.

I died once because I didn't find out how to do it best and once because the caster un-polymorphed prematurely.

Really easy. | Subject: ""easiest way for doing it solo!""
i found that this was the easiest way to do this quest solo...what you do, is you get to the tower, and you make it to the bottom floor, and let everything kill you, then you run back to your corpse, and you go all the way to the top of the tower, and rez there..in front of the bookcase, polymorph the gnoll, and then frost nova everything else, and grab the book that is sticking out, and then you will most likely die, so rez at the spirit healer, and then fly to SW to turn in the quest.. | Soloed as 28 lvl fire mage. Pretty easy. You just need to be carefull.
When you get to the top floor the book is on the left from the ramp (on the shelf). Keep to the left side of the ramp and you should not aggro Morganth.

Cords of tower: 79, 48 | Subject: ""level 26 frost mage""
The tower is at 79,49.

Very easy. If you die anywhere in the tower on your way up, walk to the second to top floor of the tower before you resurrect. Make sure you res away from the dogs and the shadowhide. After you've regained mana and health kill the three of them and go onto the spiral stairs. The book is on the bookshelf closest to where the spiral stairs connect to the top floor. There are two dogs and one shadowhide. Polymorph the shadowhide and walk down the spiral staircase. Once the dogs reach you use frost nova to keep them there. Someone said it before, if you frost nova them on the stairs then you will be out of their line of sight, so they can't use ranged attacks. Then get the book.

Getting out without dying is tricky but it can be done without killing anyone. If you've got enough mana, cast mana shield and jump from the top floor to the bottom floor between the stair cases. Once on the bottom, run out the front door, frost nova to get the gaurds from the bottom floor AND the ones outside the tower. Run.

Remember, if you die anywhere in the tower, you can resurrect anywhere in the tower."

Don't waste your time searching for Carrion Recluse Spiders as the quest says. They're the green ones that roam around the bank near the river and inside of the graveyard.

Instead, Black Widow Hatchlings to the east of Raven Hill Cemetary drop them all the time and are much, much more common. There's at least 20 or 30 of them to the east of the cemetary. | Subject: ""Tip""

I've just beaten this guy (solo) as a fire Mage 38. It's not easy... I only did it on the 3rd go, but it is possible.

Before the fight, I buffed with arcane intellect and mage armour. I also created a Mana Jade. I then activated the quest. While Tabitha was walking outside, I cast Mana Shield on myself. I stood well back from where he spawns and cast Pyroblast on him from maximum range, then alternated fireballs and fireblasts until he wore down my Mana Shield. When Mana Shield is gone, I used Frost Nova to hold him, then backed up and hit him with another fireball/flameblast combo. Once Frost Nova wears off him, you've got to kite him in circles around Tabitha's hut. Use blink to get a bit of a head start. Use the Mana Jade while kiting him, as your mana will be at about 1/3rd at this point. Whenever Fireblast is ready, turn around quickly and hit him with it. If you build up enough of a lead, he won't be able to hit you. When Frost Nova is ready, use it again and do another Fireball/Fireblast combo. Just keep repeating this and he should go down.

Always hear about Mage AoEing is the best thing since sliced bread? Never been able to REALLY do it? Now you can! Go to the Dustwallow Marsh to receive this quest, Mana Surges, but be aware you would have to complete the quest to go to Uldaman before you can gain access to Mana Surges. This is a really nifty trick that I have never heard anybody talk about. I just happened to find this out on my own and startd to use it on my mage. With this nifty trick you can gain up to 55,000 xp/hr at level 40-45 easily, and yes, solo. Here's what you do:

1.) Make hundreds of food/drinks.

2.) Accept Mana Surges quest.

3.) Walk outside near the two torches and buff up. (Mage Armor, Dampen Magic, Arcane Intellect, Mana Shield)

3.) DELETE THE QUEST! (This is the most important part.)

4.) The mobs spawn, 2 sets of 2's, 2 sets of 3's, 2 sets of 4's, all the way up to 2 sets of 5's. The mobs will spawn 1-5 seconds after they die. So AS SOON as the mobs die, run away and start resting up for the next set of AoEs.

5.) Your able to AoE these mobs and get as much XP as you possible can, for 10 minutes, then the mobs despawn. After this, go back to step number 2.

Repeat all of the above steps to get some of the best xp in the game. | When you complete this quest, you gain access to the rewards shown here: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1958 | Subject: ""Strategy""
Once you accept the quest walk outside and put your back against the tree SW of the summoning field. This is outside the aggro radius of the Mana Surges and within fireball ranges.

They do not assist so just stand there, kill some, eat/drink, then stand rinse and repeat.

I tried this several times standing at the edge of the field and drew aggro from all 4 surges and died. | The Mana Surges spawn outside of the house relatively fast, but aggroing one does not aggro the others, so you can kill one at a time and rest up when necessary.

Equip: Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 22. | Subject: ""Stand Away from Summoning Portal and Don't Tarry When Done""
Thanks to all who posted warnings to keep back from the summoning portal.  That strategy worked perfectly as you could attack one creature at a time with spells and ranged attacks. 

Unfortunately, no one mentioned that when you have killed the 12 creatures you need to visit Tabetha to complete the quest before the time runs out.  I had to learn the hard way that it does no good to hang around and continue to kill these guys after you have killed the required 12.  If you do that, and time runs out before you go back to Tabetha, even if you have killed 12 within the required time you will fail the quest.  So remember, after you kill the required 12, go visit Tabetha right away in the shack to complete the quest before time runs out.

And if you fail the quest, just ""Abandon"" it and go back to Tabetha and ""Accept"" it again (as many times as necessary until you get it done). | 10 minute timer on this quest. Pulling one or two at a time is quite easy. Decent rewards for completing this also. Using Dampen Magic on yourself can help mitigate some of the elemental damage they inflict!"

Given that, the Celestial Orb was the obvious choice, since the plus to spell damage was the same, but you get an additional +3 intellect and +3 spirit. | Subject: ""Clearing up this quest chain""
I was confused by this chain and the one that leads to Mage's Wand, which is a separate quest chain. I'll post on that chain under that quest. Here goes, for the 'Celestial Power' chain:

1. It's not listed here, but there's a Horde quest like the Alliance-side 'Journey to the Marsh' that you get from the mage trainer in Ogrimmar, sending you to Tabetha, who is southeast of Brackenwall Village in Dustwallow Marsh, almost to the coastline.
2. Tabetha gives you 'Infernal Orb' that sends you to Desolace to get an orb off a Burning Blade summoner at Mannoroc Coven. Summoners are level 38-39 warlocks with imp pets - kill the imp first, fast. Beware of demon adds here. Take orb back to Tabetha.
3. Tabetha summons (just outside her shack) a level 40 elite demon from the orb that you have to kill for 'The Exorcism' quest. This thing hits hard for its level and is a pure melee mob.
4. Tabetha then wants you to kill the Obsidian Sentinel (42 elite) just inside the back entrance of Uldaman in Badlands ('Power in Uldaman' quest). He drops the power source you take back to Tabetha. This mob a. reflects spells, including the shaman Purge spell, back onto you, and b. splits itself, making more level 42 elites. The split-off mobs also reflect spells back to you - just melee this thing down. I saw as many as 2-3 at a time, counting the original - see the thread under his listing here at Alla's.
5. Tabetha then gives you 'Mana Surges' quest. Do NOT accept this quest til you are ready. Once you accept, she goes outside her shack and starts the event that pops a chain of level 40 (non-elite) water elementals. You have to kill 12 in 10 minutes: yes, there is a timer. These things are frostbolt casters and will not come to you to melee unless you stop them casting somehow, like a silence or a shaman earth shock. Frost protection potions would be good here. As other posters in these threads have said, the first 2 elementals will aggro on you but the rest will not. You can pull singles from the group of them that pop by Tabetha's shack - there are usually as many as 4 up at a time. Once 12 are dead, do not kill more - run to Tabetha and finish the quest. If you're in a group they can kill more while you run to Tabetha.
6. After the elementals are dead, Tabetha gives you the 'Celestial power' quest, where you choose the Orb or the staff. In my opinion, the Orb is the way to go - up to 1200 mana on a clickie off-hander = yes! Go get an Illusionary Rod in Scarlet monsatery library off Doan for your staff at this level. | Tabetha herself hints you to take the Orb. And it's foolish to do otherwise.

Orb still gets used in high-end raids and BGs as an extra mana source. Staff is vendor junk almost immediately. | I would definitely take Celestial Orb over Celestial Stave in this quest. Celestial Stave can be replaced where as Celestial Orb is useful even at lvl 60 in high level instances such as Naxxramas! One can switch this orb in, use it after 30 seconds, and switch back to their normal offhand. | Subject: ""Offhand is better""
The Orb is definitely the superior choice for me, as a spellpower mage.
The int+6 is ok, but what really shines is the spellpower+13 and mana recharge ability. The mana recharge abiility makes it superior to Spirit of Aquamentas, another great offhand.
Both are replaced once you get your hands on a Rod of the Ogre Magi from Dire Maul tribute, though."
1959,Report to Anastasia,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1959,"Subject: ""Comment for ""Investigate the Alchemist Shop"" part""
Apparently comment link on that part of the quest chain doesn't work. I've reported it to thottbot staff, meanwhile would like to leave one here.
Anyways, what you need to do with the quest is use the scroll you obtained behind Anastasia. Use it in the Apothecary area. It spawns some sort of Arcane Elemental which you need to bring down to 1 health thus ""stunning"" it. While it is stunned, use the Container you obtained behind the quest giver. Elemental vanishes and leaves Filled Container Coffer on its place. Pick up 3 of those to finish the quest.
The reason I posted this comment is because my quest turned out to be broken. I kept getting 3-4 lvl 16 elementals that were charging me all at once right as they were spawning. I've died twice until I figured out something is not right :) If you happen to get same thing I did, kite 1 of the elementals (damage it periodically - fire blast, arcane explosion, wand, w/e) until the others leave you alone (they're not linked). You have to bring your victim back to the Apothecarium area though, otherwise Container will not work on it. Good luck with your quest."
1960,Investigate the Alchemist Shop,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1960,"How to solo:

Stay on the steps (top of the steps is fine) and right click on the scroll. One ghost will spawn closer to you than the others. Do your frost nova so you ONLY get one in the trap. Then run, the other 3 will follow you a very short way, then they will disappear.

As soon as they disappear, the 4th one (the one you trapped) will be after you. Kite it back to the store, and kill it there (easiest way is frost nova again inside the area, then blast it). Capture it in the containment coffer (by right clicking on the box in your stash), it will suck the spirit into the coffer, and you right click once more on the coffer on the floor.

Repeat twice more. Pretty easy once you get the hang of it.

Just make sure you only trap one. | Subject: ""What you should really do....""
Ok...so dont listen to all the of the other messages saying that they wont attack until you attack them...because they do no matter how far away you are...

1. Stand near the bridge right infront of the Alchemy shop and activate the encantion.

2. run on the bridge and only attack one of the things with your wand, fireball, blast but no AOE attacks...this is will cause the one to stay around and the others will dissapear.

3. Once the others are gone continue to attack the one that is left until you see that he is stunned...at that point activate the box and capture him. once you see a small silver container on the ground open it and grab the item

4. Then just do this two more times and you will be fine

Do Not hope to kill all of them at once because it cannot be done UNLESS you have someone helping you...which you really dont

If y | This quest can be a pain to do solo, as it will usually spawn 4 mobs (level 16-17) that instantly aggro you, and that can kill you quickly unless you are in a group, use potions, or are a few levels over the intended quest level. They are also neutral, so you won't get any assistance from any of the NPC's. You don't have that many ways of keeping them at a distance, or a good way to handle them with crowd control, so if they all catch up with you, you will have a hard time casting spells and surviving. Luckily there is also a very easy, but likely unintended way to complete the quest, as long as you have an AOE spell available.
There are two ways to do this quest; the intended way, or the easy way.
Before you leave the quest giver:
Before you run off, remember to pick up the two items you need for the next part. These items are lootable objects located just next to the quest giver.
Chest of Containment Coffers (item)
Cantation of Manifestation (item)
Tips:
When you use the cantation, all the mobs will instantly aggro on you.
The cantation can be used from a good distance away, so like other users have suggested, it can be used on the edge of the bridge (coordinates: 56,67) to reveal their positions from a safe distance. They will still aggro, but running over the bridge will usually cause them to reset.
They usually don't wander around, allowing you to know where they are after you have revealed and reset them.
How to do the quest the easy way:
Read the tips, and then head over to the Apothecarium district.
Before you start, consider following the tip about revealing and resetting them, so you know roughly where the mobs are located.
Unless it is to complete the previous step, DON'T use the cantation!
The Rift Spawn's are spread around at the main floor, and are located around 53,73, just next to the NPS's Andron Gant, Algernon and Doctor Marsh.
Unless you know where they are, start at the bottom of the stairs (the short, wide one located between the two stationed Undercity Guardian's and the three NPC's from the last step), and slowly move around while casting Arcane Explosion or another AOE spell, until you manage to hit one of them. After taking damage, it may take a second for them to fade in before you can see or target it.
Until you damage it with your AOE spell, the mob is completely invisible, and cant be seen or targeted. To conserve mana, I recommend using rank 1 versions of the spell, as the point is just to damage one, causing it to aggro you and turns visible. This allows you to both target and damage it, using your normal spells and rotation. Causing damage to the mob will not cause the other's to become visible, or aggro you.
When you have aggro on one of the Rift Spawn's, kill it, and then use your Chest of Containment Coffers near the stunned, untargetable mob. This will place a Containment Coffer on the ground that appears to be ""lootable"", but in order to actually get any loot from it, you have to wait a few seconds for the animation to complete, and for the object to be replaced with the Filled Containment Coffer that you actually can loot.
Repeat this process untill you have all three containers.
Last edited by PrefeX on 2019/09/01 | When you get this quest be sure to grab a chest of containment coffers and a Cantation of Manifestation from right next to the quest giver.

Go to the apothecary district and look for the expert alchemist and alchemy supplier and use the scroll to see the elementals. It can spawn 2-4 of these elementals so try to kite one away but be sure to bring it back to where they spawn in order to contain the stunned elemental.

Fight an elemental until it stops attacking, right click the box to capture it, open the box to collect the coffer.

Died the first time since four spawned on me and I got dazed twice/ if you're doing it slo I suggest kiting the one away. | Very easy when done correctly.
Stand at about 56,68 at the top of the stairs, and use the scroll. 4 elementals will immediately come running towards you, fire blast one and move back across the bridge, by then the others would have gone. Then bring the elemental back to your original location, and use the container when he stops attacking.
Repeat to complete quest :) | Just finished without too much trouble. I followed the method posted back in 2007 by pwningally. I am only posting to add one little wrinkle. Yes, running across the bridge will cause all but the one you tagged to retreat *but* you need to finish that one off on the alchemy lab's half of the bridge. If you are more than halfway across the bridge, it will be stunned but you will not be able to cast the containment coffer chest on it. If you pull one too far, just frost nova it and run it back before you ""kill"" it. | Subject: ""Ok.. done.. this is more of a ""gimmick"" than it is skill!""
After spending 10+ silver on just repairing my armor from dying so much here, I finally figured it out.

The key is EVASION of the critters, not over powering them. If you stand anywhere in close proximity, they murder you. It turns out you can ""reveal"" them from quite far away.

The key is using something (I used the stair ending forming a ""T"" coming from across the canals) as a ""trap"" to get only one on you. Stand on the steps and RC the scroll.. When they spawn and come after you in close proximity, run across the other side and into the room.. For me only one followed each time. You MAY have to experiment.

The exact way you do this will depend on where the critters are found.. they apparently can appear in several places in  the apothecarium depending on how the spawn is for your particular instance. Non-the-less, find a convolution you can use as the trap for you if its not in the main room.

Then using whichever spells and freezes you like, finish it off. They were always lvl 17 for me but it apparently can vary a bit. They don't exactly die, they just sort of sit there (watch the life bar). When it is finished and stationary and with the critter still targeted, right-click the crate-looking ""ehest"" and a ""time lapse"" bar moves left-to-right and a little hexagon box appears where the critter ""melts"" into the container. Then an  ""open container"" appears upper left with a red-tinted box in it. Click it to put it into your backpack. 

Do this until  you get three and return to the Magic Quarter. Even after you have all three, you can still make more appear as you wish with the ""scroll""

Good luck. Hope you're not such a slow learner as I was.. :)"

It's seem to be a little bugged at the moment.
It's passive once at the spawn, then turn aggressive.
You can use the key when is passive. While it follows you it turns aggressive again. I finished the quest killing it. | Don't bother soloing this quest under lv20. Killed my druid in 3 seconds.

Just wait till I get my cat form you pile of metal trash. | Subject: ""Hunter Solo Strategy @ level 20""
You can solo this as a hunter using the following strategy:

1. Approach the mob and get within firing range.

2. Place an immolation trap right in front of you.

3. Remember to have 'Aspect of the Hawk' on you.

4. Mark the mob with hunter's mark.

5. Order your pet in to attack, but JUST before your pet get's the mob attention, fire a concussive shot. This will pseudo-confuse the mob for a second, as it will start heading towards you, but then your pet will use growl to get its attention. With any luck (and if you have upgraded your skills), it might even stun it for a few seconds.

6. After your concussive shot, fire a serpent Sting and then just continue on auto-shot.

7. When your pet is about to die (because it will die), fire another Serpent Sting.

8. When the mob appraches you, hit him with a Raptor Strike. At this point, the mob will trigger the trap and get hurt for some serious damage. The key to the fight really is the proper use of the trap, it gives you the edge.

9. Simply finish him up with consecutive Raptor Strikes.

Hope this helps...

59,13-Top key    :  Giant Foreststrider (3rd kill)
55,12-Middle key : Greymist Tidehunter (7th kill)
57,12-Bottom key : Raging Reef Crawler (1st kill) | Subject: ""Foreststrider Correction""
When doing this quest, there are no ""ferocious foreststriders"". You have to kill the nearby Giant Foreststriders to get the second part. | Subject: ""Gyromast Keys""
1st key was on the closet crab
2nd key was on a foreststryder just east  on the grass
3rd key was on the names Murlock south near the dead turlte//2nd dead turtle from the npc around 47/18....

Gelkak Gyromast is at 56/13 north end of Auberdine

once you give him the key..go find the AUTOmated robot 1st mate...
clik on him...he turns and moves
run back to Gelkak...
then robot turns red..so watch out

kill him
'
then collect reward | Subject: ""Key parts""
The top of the key comes from the Giant Foreststriders in the south of Darkshore, around The Master's Glaive area. THese are level 18-20.

The middle part comes from the Mulocs around the beach huts south of Auberdine. The huts are found about even with the grove, so it's a ways down the coast. This is the same place Murkdeep spawns, so it's worth getting the Kill Murkdeep quest when doing this as well. These arelevel 16-18.

The bottom part drops off the tide crawlers north of the river mouth, north of Auberdine. I got mine off an encrusted tide crawler, but I suspect the raging tide crawlers will also drop them. THe encrusted were level 19-20, raging a bit higher.

Edited, Tue Dec 7 12:35:51 2004 | Subject: ""The Part Everyone cant find""
The bottom part of the key you get off the level 19 Crabs basically just beside the questgiver.

The Middle of the key which u get from the murlocks comes from another underwater ship at 55,11.

The top part of the key came from the first Giant Forestrider I killed directly east to the land from the questgiver.

Id say the part alot of people are having trouble with is the middle which is at 55,11 so good luck. Got it on the second Merlock kill .

These bears can be found south of the ruins of Ameth'Aran as well as north of Bashal'Aran. Easiest way to do this is get the bear to agro you then drop trap on ground at your feet and back away.

Found a few around 39,64 | Subject: ""it's easy!!!""
You need to get a white ""rapid thistle bear"" or however it is spelled.. not a ""thistle bear"" which is brown... just walk south along the coast and when you come to the furbolgs camp there will be some rapid ones... just go close to them.. but in safe distance.. and place the trap.. when that is done a bear will come running to you... you dont even have to place the trap near the bear.. just close... and about where to find them.. if you dont know where the furbolgs camp is.. then just run along the coast south of auberdine and look in on land.. close to the beach you will find them!..
so.. good luck and happy hunting!

//Birchmann | The Rabid Thistle Bear will move faster than 100% run speed, however, a full length sprint (or other such speed ability) will cause the bear to disappear.

The quest reads, ""Should you fail to capture a Rabid Thistle Bear and lose your trap, return to Tharnariun Treetender and request another trap."", but I found that, in the reading, ""Should you fail to capture"" means that losing the bear once you have captured it will not fail your quest and you may turn it in without the presence of the bear.

I hope this will prevent someone who had planned on using their Hearthstone from running all the way back to town."

51,37 | At 52, 35, just south of the Naga cave, is a pathway leading up to the den. You'll find level 19 mama bear snoozing between her 4 lvl 9-10 cubs. | Subject: ""Easy as Pie""
FINDING THE DEN
Easy enough. You can see on the Map where the Den is located, but walking up to the location doesn't put you directly infront of the Den, as expected. Jog a bit north and search for a path to the right. If you're climbing up the side of the mountain and you get stuck, then you've gone to far. It's an easily recognizable area.

COORDINATES
52,36 (~52.4,36.2)

DRUID TACTICS
Stand outside the Den and buff yourself using Thorns and Mark of the Wild.
Take out the cubs that arent directly near their mother first, and then use a Bandage if needed to prepare yourself for the DM.

The easiest way to do this as a Druid is to obtain the ability HIBERNATE.

Successfully put the Den Mother to sleep and let the little ones scamper towards you. Use Entagleing Roots on one cub and fight in the vicinity of any other cubs so that Thorns can continue to deplete their HP. Fight as a Bear or in Natural form. Both are easy. By the time the cubs are dead, the Den Mother will have awoken. Switch to Bear Form if you're low on Mana (making sure of course you have enough Mana to make the shift) and kick some Bear on Bear Booty!

If things gets rough, just run down the trail to heal yourself. The one thing I love about WoW is just about every mob has a short attention span.

This quest is the cave to the right of Bashal Aran on your map. You must travel north past the cave and then take a path to your right to go up the mountain and into the cave. There are several (about 5-6) lvl 10 cubs and one lvl 19 sleeping den mother. I hope this helps you out. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
The way to the cave starts on 52,36. The cave is on 52,38. | Subject: ""Not so difficult""
Did this as a lvl 18 Hunter with lvl 17 cat pet.  There were 4 (lvl 10 and 11) cubs plus the Den Mother (lvl 19).  Two of the cubs wander around towards the front of the cave, two stay in back with DM.  CC shot one of the front cubs, turned and ran to get distance from the cave.  As the cubs exited the cave, I targetted one cub with my pet and slammed the other (concussed) cub with bow until dead.  Pet managed the other cub.  Went back to cave entrance, CC shot the DM and ran away from cave.  Sicced pet on DM and hit cubs with bow till Melee range.  Melee'd cubs while occasionally taking bow shots at DM.  Killed both cubs in melee, pet took care of DM with my intermittent bow shot help.

Hint:  kill the two ""regular"" bears that prowl the area below the cave near the Blackwood camp.  That way, if the Den Mother/Cubs start kicking your butt, you can leap off the ""cliff"" and land down below.  Den Mother/cubs will only follow part way down and then return to the cave."

First discover SI:7

Located:
Elwynn Forest / Jerod's Landing / 47,87

What you gotta do:
Stealth to the cottage
Pickpocket dockmaster
Get the quest item to SI:7 | Subject: ""<Blank>""
yea all you have to do is pickpocket the dock master. took me all of 2 hours to fiqure that out i kept killing him lol | An easy quest to do, just remember you are not killing the mob, but simply just stealthing behind him and pickpocketing him!

It is an easy mistake to think you need to kill him for the drop but that is not the case :) | Subject: ""Quest: The Whole Thing""
This quest starts with: Master Mathias Shaw, who you can find in Stormwind, in SI:7.

The quest tells you to find the Defias Dock Master and get his shipping schedule.

You can find the Dock Master and ""Jerod's Landing"",or at coordinates 47.87. Or if you don't have a coordinates system, here are the directions: Simply go south of Goldshire and head east along the coast until you see the dock.

Next, once you've found it, simply STEALTH and walk in the house where the Defias Dock Master is (He is a goblin), and get behind him and use your ""Pick-Pocket"" spell. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO KILL HIM, just pick-pocket him and leave, and go back to Master Mathias Shaw in in SI:7. | Subject: ""Empty loot when pickpocketing""
If you're sure you have this quest and you don't already have the quest item, and you still get an empty loot when you pickpocket the dockmaster, you have to kill him.  Someone else picked his pocket without killing him and hence his ""pickpocket loot"" is empty.  Killing him and letting him reset will refill his pockets when he respawns.  Just a tip to ease your frustration... | Coordinate 47, 87 | I've watched a few other rogues doing this quest and there's one thing these guides fail to mention.

JUST GO STEALTH AND PICKPOCKET. DO NOT SAP FIRST.

If you use Sap first, it will automatically drop stealth and enter you in combat and his bodyguards will spawn and likely kill you."

Go to the Cenarion Enclave district in Darnassus and when you get there you'll see the girl dot waypoint on your map. it's misleading. If you search hard enough there's a door that leads underground that's directly underneath the gold dot above ground.

2282,Alther's Mill,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2282,"Subject: ""Lockpicking""
The following areas provide footlockers that can be used to upgrade Rogues' lockpicking abilities.

Hillsbrad Foothills - Durnholde Keep
Redridge Mountains - Lake Everstill
Ashenvale Forest - Zoram Strand
Stonetalon Mountains - Windshear Crag and Associated Mines
Wetlands - Murloc Camps
Desolace - Sar'theris Strand
Badlands - Angor Fortress
Swamp of Sorrows - Pool of Tears
Searing Gorge - The Slag Pit
Tanaris Desert - Lost Rigger Cove
Azshara - Bay of Storms
Eastern Plaguelands - Tyr's Hand (elite

Keep inmind that you will want to lockpick in the area that is current for your level if possible. if for example if you are 50th and your lockpicking is 100 you will need to go back to some lower level areas and then work your way up to the more difficult. hope this helps. | WARNING: Terrible quest design. You have to learn the Pick Lock skill from the Rogue trainer first, before you can do this quest. It doesn't say so anywhere in the quest description. So first, go to your Rogue trainer and learn the skill (with skill level 0), then travel to Lakeshire. | This location is very easy to find using the coordinates: 52,45.

If you stand at a particular spot. You have the ability to unlock 4 of the five Practice Lockbox's there. (Screenshot Provided).

Just in case. The words ""Practice Lockbox"" will ALWAYS be yellow. The word ""Locked"" changes colors the way Ebonstar says.

You should stay there with the practice boxes until you cannot level your picking skill anymore (when the word ""Locked"" becomes gray).

The boxes respawn very quickly, and sometimes they are booby-trapped. ( I had the Frost Hold Magic trap. )

I was able to gain 101 skill points from this location. I went there with a skill level of 4; and left there with a skill level of 105. Not Bad - Now I go back to the Zoram Strand!

There are numerous creatures outside. But you do not have to worry about them coming in to attack you (at least I did not have to). My stealth was good enough to walk past all creatures - INCLUDING horde. So it is possible to make it there without a fight. In case you are just trying to get your picking skill up.

Good luck,
~Lie | Need Lockpicking of 25 to open the chest. Coordinates at 52,41. Training Chests go yellow at 30 and green at 55. | Subject: ""What you have to do!""
Now Alther's Mill is down the road east of Lakeshire. Follow the road east from Lakeshire till you come to a fork in the road, head down the right path (dirt path) Watch out for the lvl18-20beasts. The mill should be a building with a big saw in the middle.

At Lvl 16 the maximum lockpick skill you can get is 80, so practice on the locks till you get 80.Your maximum lockpick skill increases by 5 every time you gain a level

The reward he gives you is useless and can be destroyed or put in the bank. It has no furthur use so its trash. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
The certificate is to hang on the wall and show everyone that you are a certified klepto.....won't your mother be so proud!...but seriously, it is just a certificate, you don't use it for anything.  The purpose of the quest is to get you trained up in lock picking so you are able to use the skill for the other quests to come that involve picking locks.  The very next rogue quest involves picking a lock in the tower in SE Westfall. | Subject: ""coords""
51,44 | Subject: ""Beginning of Lockpicking""
You need ZERO lockpicking to do this quest - it is intended to help you start your lockpicking!

When you pick up the quest, he gives you a set of thieve's tools.

Take them to 51,45 and practice on the practice lockboxes there for a few minutes until you max your skill on them (they respawn instantly, so it's a VERY efficient way to skill up). Anyone who practiced lockpicking before doing this quest just wasted their time/energy.

Once you get your lockpicking high enough, simply open the chest (same location) and complete the quest. You can finish it with as little as 25 skill, but spend 10 mins here and you can get your lockpicking up to about 75-100, and it will be time well spent.

Edited, Nov 29th 2006 3:31pm by Jordster | Subject: ""Easy way to improve Lockpicking""
Go to Lakeshire

*Ironforge < Stormwind < Lakeshire, Or if you havent been there yet, Follow the road East of Goldshire until you come across it*

Head north up a path for about 10 seconds, then turn Right on a dirt path, Walk a little and you should see what looks like a lumber mill, there are about 6 pracitce lockboxes there. They keep respawning too, They should get you to at least 100 lockpicking in 5 - 10 minuites | Subject: ""Easy way to lvl lockpicking""
The lockboxes here let you go up to skill 90 lockpicking easy, after 90, I picked locks about 10-20 times without getting skill, they were still green though, but still nothing. This is by far the best way to get some decent lockpicking skill."

1. Get some E.C.A.C from the machine right next to quest giver.

2. go south from Ratchet until u reach the first ship.

3. walk on to the ship on the ships pointy front thingy.

4. go to the second level of the ship, in the farthest room towards the shore.

5. stand between to chests and perfom Pick Lock on these, swithching from chest to chest (this way it doesnt matter when ur affected by Frost Nova and Rat-curse. I went from skill 1 to 100 in about 15 min.

6. go to the bottom lvl of the ship and pick the lock on the chest.

7. use E.C.A.C on polly and kill him as he turns into a small lvl 18 parrot. (good idea to put the E.C.A.C in ur action bar)

8. turn in quest.

--------
Contempt lvl 20 UD Rouge - Frostwhisper
Artemisdk lvl 60 NE Rouge - Kor�gal
-------- | 1. Get Lockpicking tools and ECAC from the robot next to the quest giver.

2. travel south into the merchant coast, and board the ship at coord :64,45 - you can board from the front tip

3. on the first level down you can skill up your lockpicking to 5xlvl (ex. 17x5= 85)

3a. tip: find a spot where you can loot two or three footlockers, that way you don't have to move. don't worry about getting rat nova'd or frost nova'd

4. on the second level down open the chest, it will be empty, once you open it, polly will spawn, stealth and use your ECAC on polly, put ECAC into your hot bar. then defeat polly and loot treasure.

5. DO NOT loot the chest again, as polly will repsawn and KILL you. | Subject: ""Stealth required when facing big ass Polly""
Make sure your lockpicking skill is at 85 by picking the four lockboxes upstairs, then go downstairs and pick the lock of the jewel.  When the giant lvl 50 Polly comes out, Stealth first before you give him a cracker, because Polly does want a cracker, but if he sees you, he'll bite your head off.  Stealth so he doesn't see you, get near him, stuff his face, and then he'll transform into midget Polly... then kick his ass and loot.  Have fun. | Subject: ""Quest Descrption""
Head south of ratchet and look for the ship the first ship right next to the coast. you will need to jump on the point of the boat to gain entrance to the deck. On the second level, there are 4 locked chests you could pick (2 were trapped, 1 empty, and one had 2 mutilated rat carcasses). Head to the bottom level and pick the chest. A fight with a huge parrot (yes, a parrot) will begin. Use the ECAC (quest item given by robot next to Wrenix) to shrink the parrot to normal size. He's level 18. Loot him to quet the southsea treasure. Your quest reward, thistle tea, is wonderful. BTW: completed quest easily w/lvl 18 troll rogue

SnoVipr | Subject: ""ECAC""
Currently you have to attack the big parrot and drag him up the stairs one level. Then you can right click on the ECAC and the parrot will shrink.

The big parrot is a badass, so you have to do it quickly. He can't attack you until you get up one flight of stairs though, so don't panic. | Subject: ""Southsea Treasure""
1. First , need take a E.C.A.C from robot near quest giver.
2. Then Need move to 64.45 . 64.45 is in the ship .
3. In the ship was a box . It name is The Jewel of the Southsea .
4. Then need one time open The Jewel of the Southsea . And in the minute there come a bird lvl 50.
5. Then need target bird and give she E.C.A.C . In the 2 seconds she's level will be demoted to 18 level and bird will be maked smaller .
6. Need to kill that bird and take from she Southsea Treasure.
7. Need move back to Ratchet for your revard ^^ .
>This is end , good luck . Remember name of the Box< | Subject: ""Darnit Polly, take the frickin' cracker!""
I tried this three times, and third time was the charm... once I figured it out!  Here's how you do it - my lockpicking on the box was orange, so I didn't have much trouble opening it.  Have your bag with the cracker in it open and be ready to click on it so you're not fumbling around after Polly spawns.  After you finish picking the lock, stealth.  Sneak to where you can target Polly, then right click on the cracker in your bag.  This'll do the transformation and you can easily kill the parrot and get the quest piece then!  I tried attacking the big Polly and trying to trade the cracker with it at first... yeah, don't do that, it doesn't work.  Right click on that sucker! ;)

Xandara, Rogue of the Forsaken
<Team Hate>
Sargeras | Subject: ""ship location""
the location of the ship is 64,45 for you who have coordinates | Subject: ""TIPS""
DO NOT open the chest more than once that summons the parrot...because the parrot will come AGAIN and you only have ONE cracker...so...basically, you're toast if you do. Also, you CAN STILL open the lockboxes when you are a rat.

Also, when you are lvling your lockpicking skill with the chests in there...a faster way is to stand so that theres a chest in front of you, one to the left of you and one to the right of you...then you never have to move around the room to open the boxes...you can just stay in that one spot and open those 3 in front of you over and over. They reappear fast. (also, by doing this, when you get stuck in an ice trap, it wont matter).

Also, your lockpicking skill will only go as high as your characters level x5. Soo, if I was lvl 17, that would be 17x5=85, so I could only get a max lockpicking skill of 85 while I'm at level 17 on my rogue. So therefore, you can only increase your lockpicking as your character level increases as well. Good luck. | Don't forget to TRAIN Pick Locks from the rogue trainer in org before you go. Otherwise you will be standing there with thieves tool and lockboxes and nothing to do."

**SPOILER**

The Emerald is inside the village of Starbreeze. I found it in the fartest building, but I bet the location is random.

Move your cursor on every object (chests, furnitures...) until the item selected becomes highlighted and usable.

Once you acquire the item, a pendant, from the drawer you need to open it (right click on it) to find the Emerald.

2518,Tears of the Moon,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2518,"Subject: ""Lady's Location - Other Info, Please Read -""
First, Lady's location can be on EITHER side of the northern edge of Wellspring River.  Don't just go to one side and expect her to be there - I've done this quest twice with two different characters, a lvl 11 Priest and a lvl 11 Druid.  While playing the Druid, she was on the west side.  On my Priest, she was on the east side.  The east side is defintiely a little easier as there are less Feral Nightsabers (lvl 11).  There are, however, several other spiders around her lvls 10-11.  Be aware of that.  Check both sides before you give up (of the river)

Second, Lady S. is a lvl 12 GREY spider - this might help you recognize her out of all the other spiders.

Third, Lady S. was relatively easy to kill with both characters.  Wait until she's by herself, if you're lvl 10-11, because a second or third spider could finish you off.  Anybody lvl 12 or higher should be able to take her and one of her lvl 10-11 buddies no problem. 

Hopefully this helps you.  Also, be aware that there are Timberling Elementals in the river, so when you're crossing to either side, be aware of their presence.  Good luck friends!

Gravity
Gnomercy | Lady Sathrah is a level 12 large grey spider that can be found at multiple coordinates. A few to try are 39, 25 and 48, 25. Search the general area east or west of the river at the top of the map of Teldrassil and you should find her.

If you are level 10 or 11, you can kill her by waiting until she is off by herself because she spawns minions. If you are level 12 or higher, killing her and the minions should be no problem. | Subject: ""Change of Address""
Due to the demands of raising my thousands of offspring, I have moved to new, roomier accomodations. Please update your address books to my new location - 42,25 West Side, Wellspring Lake. You'll know you've gone too far if you fall a thousand feet into the ocean.

Love and kisses,
Lady Sathrah | Subject: ""lady satra is a spider....""
Yes you have to know that lady satra is a GREY SPIDER...do Not look for a human like thing.
I found her west of the river, at the very top of map, i could not go any further up, and she was close to the river but if you walk on water you have to go around to the tops of the hills but she is not with the things that have the blue flush balls around them by the river, she is on higher ground whit spiders and those pumma like animals, yet from the place where she is you can see the river viewing it to the down side of hils but you can't walk from the river directly to the spot you have to walk fairly close to river yet not realy along the river and cut into the land before the river ends and when you see the swamp things with blowing balls around them. I hope that helps a bit... good luck | Subject: ""info about Lady Sathrah""
these are all the coordinates everyone has posted:
41,25 / 48,25 / 39,25 / 46,27
i found her at 48,25 the most common.
DONT LOOK FOR A HUMANOID, she is a large gray spider!

however the info says the quest ends at darkshore with Priestess A'moora, this is not true, the decription is correct she is in the temple of the moon in darnassas. so dont wast your time going to darkshore to complete this quest."

2541,The Sleeping Druid,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2541,"Easy enough quest (was able to solo as a level 9 druid), but the drop rate is awful so expect to be down here for a while - you should kill enough to level, at least. Careful, however, some pulls will net you two or three mobs. | Subject: ""Some details from my travels""
I solo'd this quest as a level 9 druid (leveled up to 11 doing it) without dying even once. I did have to fight two furbolgs at once several times. The shamans will heal self once and may heal another once as well. The respawn rate is very fast.

I went to the first two bridges (across which are the first two items for The Relics of Wakening quest,  The Relics of Wakening ).

Then I continued down, a bit left then curving around to the right and under the bridges.. past that furlbog hiding around the corner.

I came down to an opening with a bridge going up which leads to the room with the Druid that gives this quest. I had to fight two Augors to talk to him (and every other time I visited him... they spawn fast.)

Facing the bridge up to the druid's room, I went left and then down the tunnel to the left. Eventually it opened out to a circular multilevel room with the druid's evil body walking around it.

I killed many Shaman without getting the voodoo charm that the druid wants, and ended up finding his body before I even finished the first part of his quest. I went all the way through the place killing everything and none of the shamans dropped the item..

I started going around again until I was so aggravated that I paged a GM complaining.. you know.. should I just abandon the quest, abandon it and start over, is it broken or what? I killed a few more shaman without any drop and then gave up and logged off.

When I came back online several hours later, I had an email from Blizzard saying that I should move all of my quest items to my main back pack (from my other quests) and abandon the quest and log off and back on, then get the quest again.

I did what the email suggested, then fought my way back to the druid, got the quest again, and the item dropped from the first shaman I fought after that.

Edited, Sun Apr 2 08:31:15 2006 | Subject: ""Something else to consider...""
I have confirmed that the charm is group loot so the easiest way to do this quest is get a 5 man group together and kill as many shamans in the den as fast as you possibly can, then when it drops, all 5 people will be able to loot the same corpse.  I had to kill about 10-15 shamans with the group before it dropped. | I've leveled twice down here. Had to go back to town to sell and get more water, twice. And I still have not gotten the drop. This is ridiculous in the extreme. Literally, over 90 minutes in the Barrow and no charm.... grrrrr. | Subject: ""Head outside""
Shaman just outside of the hold drop the charm.

Trust me. :)"

As a lvl 59 warlock i soloed everything till step 19. You need a full party to do 19 and 20. | Subject: ""Great xp!""
My wife and I took a crack at this quest chain. We got up to step 16 or 17 in one night and netted 90k xp for the work. Best night of xp by far for us!

I'd highly recommend this chain for anyone trying to make that last push to lvl 60. For alliance it starts in Nethergard Keep. There's a high elf at the top of the main tower who kicks it off."

Gotta love how this whole tragedy is based on the fact that not one of the soldiers at the outpost could be bothered to make the 30 second walk to Stonard and actually ask where the orders were.

Edit: nvm, I have no clue apparently.

Edited, Sat Oct 1 23:05:24 2005 | Easy to solo as 49 rogue.

Just keep going right and you'll find him surrounded of murlocs.

The servants of Razelikh are found around the dark portal. Watch out for the Felguard patrol around the portal.

Servants of Allistarj are all found along the eastern wall of the zone, stopping just before Nethergrade Keep.

Servants of Servine are found along the wall north of the entrance to the tainted scar (which is the western wall)

Servants of Grol are the most difficult to find, in my opinion. You can find one in a cave guarded by ogres in the mountain off the path to the tainted scar. Just follow the path until you begin travelling west, then go north and look for a lone mountain, Once you find ogres, you've found the one servant. The other place to find them are Grol's fort, located in the northwest corner of the zone. You'll know you found it because you'll see a tower and a base with horde banners. The servants are in there. To get there, go west along the northern wall from the entrance of the zone.

A note that the servants will NOT die until you smash the crystal, and the stun effect on them wears off after around 30 seconds. If you're having trouble smashing the crystal, remember that you have to stun it (Drop around 85% of it's health) next to the crystal in order to smash it.

For those who want coords, 49.7, 43.8 is where the lone Servant Of Grol is.The dark portal is around 58.8, 51.6. Frydebo provided coords to the other servents, as well as the Grol fort.

I noticed a lot of you are reporting this as ""bugged""... I have went through the same problem and I have a solution for you.

When you kill the Servant, do it CLOSE to the Stone of Binding. Not love making close. Just a few yards should be fine, and make sure the Servant isn't going to block your cursor from targetting the stone.

I have tried killing servants several times using this method after many attempts that the stones failed to be targettable, and it works every time.

Hope this helps. | Subject: ""Svine""
The Sevine guys are near the alter of Storm, there are 3 spawn spots for them from what I've seen. The one nearest the fire camp is the hardest to get to, because he is linked to a caster. They are level 57 or so.

The Razelikh guys are near the dark portal. They are all along the upper edge of the cliff. Felguards and hounds wander the area. They are around level 55 or so.

The Grols are in dreadmaul hold outside of the keep but within the gates. They are around 53 or so.

Haven't figured where the last guys are yet, so good luck finding them. Quest reward is a nice one along with the exp bonus. | Subject: ""Locations""
The Servants of Razelikh are on the crest of the crater around the Dark Portal and are by far the fastest to get completed. Just watch out for the numerous and quickly respawning patrols.

Servant of Grol is in the cave where the Ogres are. The stone is all the way in the far back in the cave. The ogres respawn moderately quickly.

Servant of Sevine are west of the Ogre cave where you find the Servant of Grol. They're in a camp of other humanoids and there's an occasional silver elite that comes through the area too, so be careful.

Servant of Allistarj is in the Serpent's Coil area, on the far east side of the valley/ravine, near a cave. There are a lot of other humanoids in the area. | To finish this quest, you must first locate the Stone of Binding, which will be nearby any servant, but will not be interactable right away, which means that there will be neither mouseover prompt nor highlighting. Given this and overall color resemblance of these objects and Blasted Lands' landscape, this could be proven difficult, but it is crucial to this quest.
After the stone located, you must attack a servant while keeping them around the stone, but you won't be able to kill it yourself: their health will stop draining after around 10% and they will be stunned for about 30 seconds. At this moment Stone of Binding will become interactable, and you'll need to smash it via pressing RMB as hard as possible, this will help you as it helped me.
If you fail to do this in time after engaging and stunning a servant, you'll make yourself an invincible enemy since the stun is off but the inv is still on. Also, cleaning but not looting other mobs that are usually party loitering around can help a lot, too. | Confirmed that skilling up weapon skills on Servants of Grol is working and is not patching in classic as of this date.

Two Servants of Grol can be found North and North West of Dreadmaul Hold. | STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO SUCCESSFULLY FREEING A SERVANT.

1) Find a Servant.
2) Find a small black floating crystal nearby (aprox. 20-40 yards from the Servant).
3) Kill all trash mobs close to the crystal (you don't want them to attack you later as they would interrupt your step 7).
4) Engage the Servant.
5) Pull Servant close (aprox. 2 yards) to the crystal.
6) Damage the Servant until he ""bubbles"" himself (around 1% HP).
7) Right-click the crystal a wait until you finish destroying it.
8) Profit.

Very Soloable, fun quest

you can only break the stone if they are in the green vulnerable form, and if they are near their stone | Subject: ""No BUG: explained""
These is no bug here,
you have to pull the monster next to the stone,

as its then hard to select the stone ;) ) | Subject: ""Mini-guide to Stones that Bind Us""
There is a lot of confusion about what the stones look like, how to find them, how to free the servants. I just solo'd the whole thing as a level 57 retribution pally, hence no stealth. If I can do it, anybody can, trust me. Here's how:

Stones: I just uploaded a screenshot of a stone behind a Servant of Allistarj, but if it isn't viewable the stone looks like a amall bronze obelisk, and it floats. They all look the same, regardless of which servant.

Servants: They're all invincible unless you have this quest. To free them, you must first whack them until they go into a kind of stasis mode. They appear to be stunned and fade out, though once I noticed a servant didn't fade out. They become stunned for a short time when you knock their health down to near nada. While they're stunned, go after the stone.

Destroying the stones: While the servant is stunned, roll over the stone until you see the gold wheel, then right-click on it. If you don't see the wheel re-position yourself and continue to roll-over, with a clear view of the stone. Eventually you'll see the wheel. Hopefully the servent won't have revived by then. Once you activate the wheel, the stone will countdown to self-destruct and the servent will be freed. You'll whack him once more then loot him. The loot sucks but the xp is ok.

The good thing is, you can camp a stone site and get your quota without even hitting the other servant locations. This is huge. Servants rez within a few minutes, as noted below. Stones re-appear first, then the Servant.

Servant of Sevine: See mob link above. As you approach the bottom of the hill where the first servant is, across from the Dreadmaul Ogre Servant of Gol, there is a Servant of Sevine surrounded by mobs. Ignore him. Sneak up the road that crosses in front of him. Best if approached from the north. You only have to knock out 2 or 3 mobs to get to the next Servant, who's on the south side of the road with his stone. Watch for foot patrols, but they're infrequent. This Servant made my quota of 3. The Servant at the bottom of the hill and the one at the top of the road, inside a weird compound, are too well guarded. The one I described is virtually alone.

Servant of Grol: This was the hardest Servant because he's so densely guarded. BUT, slip into his cave from the south side, across from the first Servant of Sevine. You have to knock off about 3 or 4 ogres to get to the mouth of the cave, then sidle along the side of the opening into the cave. Deal with one guard at the door and the Servant. Kill the guard first but be careful not to aggro any more around the mouth of the cave. Draw the Servant inside and stay there. Free him three times. He's the only Servant of Grol, it takes about 4 minutes for him and his stone to rez, the stone first. No ogres enter the cave, so you have plenty of time to prepare for each of his rezzes. The only Servant of Grol I found was in a cave across the road from the Servant of Razelikh location I describe below. Also facing the Servant of Sevine. You will NOT find a Servant of Grol in the ogre compound due west of the keep. What you will find there is Grol himself, a 58 demon elite.

Servant of Razelikh: This was actually the easiest, though they and their guards are the highest levels. The trick is, go to the south-most edge of the Dark Portal crater, avoiding demon patrol pairs. Once against the mountain you can't go farther south, but you can climb up above the Servants. There are two of them between the crater and the road into the next (highly nasty) region. Alternate between them, staying on the mountainside above them, until you get quota of 3. Hit the demon patrols for xp if you want, but the loot isn't great.

Servant of Allistarj: Just clear the mobs around the Servant, you don't have to kill them all. Engage the Servant as described above, x9. I used the Servant location just below the keep, slightly to the southeast. The elite you need to kill for a follow-up quest is also inside the cave at this location, but to get the Servant you don't need to go into the cave. In fact, DON'T, is my advice.

Good luck!

For anyone still confused after all above:
For alliance characters you pick up this quest from a guy at Nethergarde Keep who tells you to go talk to the Fallen Hero of the Horde. Apparently Horde characters can start directly at the Fallen Hero.  The Fallen Hero of the Horde is in Swamp of Sorrows, just before the entrance into Blasted Lands.  If you don't know where that is, how the hell did you get to the quest anyhow?
The EASIEST WAY to do this quest is just find the FIRST STONE/FIRST SERVANT on your route to the location, camp that and keep killing it as it respawns.  They are on a standard respawn timer, about 5 minutes. If you are bored you can practice skills on other enemies in the area, or log out and back in again.  The servants do not pull other npcs to them if you attack, but if other npcs are withing aggro range of you, or spawn within aggro range, they attack you of course.  Also, these servants spawn WITHIN RANGE of the stone they are tied to!  You SHOULD NOT have to worry about ""pulling them to the stone"" if you just fight them where they spawn! Just kill other npcs first, that are between them and their stone!  The stones DONT GLOW, but they are obvious stones sticking up from the landscape near the servants.  Once you kill a servant you have a set time to destroy the stone, about a minute I'd say.  If you don't destroy the stone by then, the servant comes back to life and attacks you again and now you must run away...unless you just wanna practice weapon skills on it, because you will never kill it now until you leave.  It will interrupt your destroying the stone, and it wont die until the stone is destroyed...so you have to back away and start again.  Once you destroy a stone, the servant automatically dies, you dont need to attack it again.  Servants and stones are at the approaches to: Altar of Storms, Dreadmaul Hold, Serpent's Coil, and Dark Portal. You don't have to ENTER any of those locations, just approach them and you should find a stone with servants connected...

A good strat to do this and avoid the respawn rate is to avoid looting, I know its hard, but then the corpses will lay on the ground for about 12 mins before despawning which should give you PLENTY of time to finish Kirith and be out of there before the respans pop! | The cave is on the eastern side of the Blasted Lands. After killing the 55 elite demon Kirith (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=7728), his spirit will appear (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=7729). Talk to the spirit to complete the quest. | Subject: ""58rogue and 60 warrior""
Ok, here are the directions..
1. Fly To Nethergarde Keep
2. Go to The Seprents Coil, near where you kill ashmane boars/basilisks and above The Dark Portal.
3. Clear all addons; remember Servant Of Allistarj cannot be killed.
4. Enter The Cave.
5. Kill Everything in the way.
6. Follow the path.
7. You will reach a place where you must turn left to continue.
8. If it is the wrong place there will be 2 normal mobs.
9. If it is the RIGHT place (second time it looks the same as the first) there will be 2 mobs and a GIANT felhunter.
10. Kill the mob standing on the correct direction to continue walking into the cave.
11. Kill the mob that can be pulled.
12. If you are alone, there are 2 types of tactics:
- Go allout against Kirith The Damned and either kill him and quickly talk to his spririt for the followup or..
- Kill the adds and die then kill Kirith..
WARNING- The mobs spawn VERY fast.
13. If you are in a group 1 person takes out the addons and 1 goes againts Kirith. AS long as adds die ure good.
14. The person fighting Kirith may die, the look at Kiriths health, either go allout against him or die and go together.
15. Talk to the spirit.
16. If your a miner there is a Small Thorium Vein behind Kirith, mine it.
17. Then either:
-Stealth out
-Hearthstone out
-Kill all the spawns (basically everything u killed before) and exit the cave.
18. Go to the Fallen Hero Of The Horde to handin your quest and get the followup to go to Azshara. | Location is 65,34 end of the cave

Good luck ;) | Subject: ""Kirith's Spirit""
You don't have to be the one who kills Kirith to talk to his spirit. So long as someone kills him and his spirit appears, anyone with the quest can talk to him and turn in the quest regardless of whether you took part in the killing.

So if you see a bunch of peeps going for him, just tag along =) | Subject: ""A pain""
Ok this quest is a pain.. I found Kirith in the very bottom of the cave found in serpents coil. HE is a HUGE Felbeast. Mages this must suck for you cause he drains huge chunks of mana.. Also he comes with 2 of the local baddies. Much luck to all who attempt this solo.. My third attemp and I am about to call a guildie in for backup"

This is the island with the arch on it, almost due east of the path leading down to the turtle beach.  The hint given in the quest is totally wrong. 

Also, what you are looking for is a large stone tablet, not a table.  Preview is your friend, folks.

4200 XP.  Rin'ji is in a cage by the lake in the back of Quel'Danil Lodge.  When you let him out, he'll go to Shadra'Alor.  Clear the way out of the lodge before you accept the quest.  The spawning mobs aren't a big problem but he can get into a lot of trouble in the forest.  When he gets close to Shadra'Alor he'll run away.  Let him go.  Go to the island north of Revantusk, where you'll find his tablet on top.  That completes the quest and starts the next one in the series. | Subject: ""kords""
end quest 86,59 and start second part. | Subject: ""Turtles and Secrets""

Alright people, here's the deal:

Once you get the 3 silk and 2 apples, go back and talk to the goblin in the SW keep gardens.  You'll get a quest completion then if spybot is next to him, a new yellow ! will appear.  If it's not there and he's mumbling about a tree branch, then someone has activated the quest and you'll have to wait.  Once they kill the dudes (or die) the spybot will come back after about 2 minutes, at which point the quest is available again.

If you die or someone else tags one of the bosses, YOU MUST ABANDON THE QUEST before you can activate it again.  You DO NOT need to get the apples and silk again, that quest in finished.

This quest is really easy, especially if there happens to be other people standing around.  I soloed it with my 30 or 31 pally, barely taking 1/3 of my health in damage.  My 30 druid teamed up with a 30 warrior and we finished it in about 10 seconds flat.

If you are 180 in Blacksmithing (which I got at level 32) the Green Iron Hauberk is easily twice as good as this Breastplate. Not nearly as easy to get but I guess in some instances you do get what you pay for (so to speak).

Edited, Tue May 31 23:08:12 2005 | If you're looking at the comments on this recipe, plan, or quest you might be a collector or completionist.
This is a compiled list of all of the cross-faction recipes in the game.

Most (not all)  Cooking recipes on the Alliance side are sold by Kendor Kabonka. The Horde do not have a corresponding NPC, so if you are an Alliance character wanting to create an alt on the opposite side to obtain the recipes for your main, unfortunately you'll have to have a level appropriate character to do the quests to obtain some of these recipes.

All of the recipes except one ( Plans: Orcish War Leggings) can be traded cross-faction on the neutral AH.

Go to yeti cave at 53,56.  Go through first part of cave, should then see it in the clearing. | Subject: ""Not Impossible I Guess""
Tried this with my 48 Druid three times. Not a big fan of escort quests (always given at too early a level) but why not? Cleared the path by killing 12 yetis in advance but they respawn so quickly that's it's hard to completely clear. At least the skins are great and the yetis usually drop 1-2S.

Each time the chicken aggroed the yetis in the cave on the way out. No problem. Outside the cave, the chicken would aggro another (no problem) but then a second would run up. I was OK but lost the chicken on that double the first time.

The second time, a re-run; made it through the cave and the double outside the cave. Headed to the path. The chicken aggroed one yeti, then two. We were doing OK until TWO more yetis showed up. Did they think we were serving lunch? Four is about one too many for me, so I ran. Chicken salad.

The third time I cleaned out all the yetis between the path and the cave. There were only 3. Where was the 4th? Same thing - made it out of the cave, past the double at the front of the cave and off to the path. One yeti, two yeti, three yeti, four. Five yeti, six yeti, seven yeti, more? I was in the middle of a yeti convention. Ran and just barely made it to the path. Chicken soup.

Groundhog Day? I don't know how you solo guys managed to do this and I didn't get to 48 by killing rabbits and cows. I didn't dump the quest but I'll need to bring reinforcements. It's probably worth doing (like most escort quests) but I haven't seen one yet (that I remember) that most players can do solo. | Subject: ""Definitely a drop and bring some friends!""
To find the robot go into the Yeti cave, the path it bends around and opens back up to a small area enclosed outside.  Right before the entrance to the next cave area is the bot.

The first part where you find the robot is ok -getting past the Yetis but the next part is a frustrating escort mission.  You meet at least 3 waves of 5 mobs attacking at different legs of the journey all the way to the docks on the west shore.  As with these missions if the robo dies so does the mission so you have to restart it again in the caves. | I'm going to post this message on all three of these ""Find"" quests, just in case someone doesn't see it on one of the other two.

If you plan to do these quests in a group (which is very helpful, as any escort quest) everyone must first have completed the ""Find"" part of the quest, which means you have to find the chicken, choose ""Complete"" and then be *offered* the next part of the quest, which is the actual escort part. But do not accept this part until everyone has done the ""Find"" part, otherwise it won't be offered to them as escort quests normally are, because technically you are not on the same stage of the quest yet.

So just complete the ""Find"" part, then when the next part is offered, decline it until everyone is ready to accept it. | Subject: ""2767, I think""
Copied from the next quest page:

And here's my solo strategy...
Score 0.3    Vote: [-] [+] by connery, 2.3 months ago
What I did for Feralas and Hinterlands (for Tanaris I had help) to do them solo as a 50 Druid was:

1) Clear out the first set of creatures on the route - slimes for Hinterlands, yetis for Feralas.

2) Follow the chicken stealthed if possible, or if not, don't let any creatures aggro on YOU.  If they aggro on the chicken, and the chicken keeps walking, don't interfere.  The chicken will walk away unhurt eventually, but if the creature aggro's on you, the chicken will either help out (and maybe get killed), or walk too far away from you and the quest will fail.

3) When the chicken detects an ambush, RUN OUT IN FRONT and aggro ALL of the ambush creatures, and anything else in the chicken's path!  Run down the path pulling the creatures with you, and eventually they will give up and run back to the ambush point.  The trick is that now the chicken will have walked far enough past the ambush point that the creatures won't see it, and you get away clean!  Be sure not to run too fast and get too far away from the chicken (and the quest fails), but also be sure to run fast enough that the chicken doesn't aggro one of the creatures onto itself!  It's kind of a balancing act.

4) Try again and again after you fail.  You will get better at it.

5) If you are about to try it solo, go ahead and tell the General channel that you are going to try the chicken escort, and please if anyone is on the path, could they hang out and help kill the ambushes, or even come run interference?  I know that if I hear you, I am going to help out, because I know what a bear these quests are. | Subject: ""Confusing...""
Because there are three different chickens, it can really confuse people on which one their really looking for... Lets start with this one.

First of all, this chicken isn't in Hillsbrad, Tanaris, Alterac Valley, Hinterlands...It's Feralas, where you got the egg.

The Yeti cave you're looking for is around 54,56 or south of Dire Maul.

It took me forever looking for the robotic chicken because most of the things people sent for this was incorrect and because I got distracted.

While your escorting the chicken, you'll get some mobs of 3-5 that will attack you, they are from level 42-45.

Lastly, why the GM's kept saying to go to Booty Bay to some of you for the quest is because after you escort the chicken off, you're supposed to go to Booty Bay to finish the quest.

Hope this helps! | I feel it's pretty much an unwritten rule to help anyone you see on this quest, regardless of faction. Reason being, these are already a pain in the ass, without hostility. This one in particular is dreadful, with a kamakaze chicken, who often runs ahead, ignoring it's own spawned mobs to fight randoms.

When I was doing this quest with another Hordie, a couple higher level Alliance stopped by and helped with the final battle. I later helped out one of theirs when I saw them struggling with the final two battles. It was a gnome of all things, and I can't stand those creatures. It hugged me..."

Now this is actually an incredibly long quest line that has you killing lots of mobs and bosses here in Blasted Lands, in Azshara, and then back to Blasted Lands again, ending with a quest to kill Razelikh the Defiler.  Now Thottbot doesn't have the whole quest line linked together, and some of the rewards are missing, but here's the full line as close as I can make it:

Step 1 (Alliance only, Horde just go straight to Step 2, far as I know):
Giver: Ambassador Ardalan
Name: Petty Squables
Description: Talk to the Fallen Hero of the Horde, who can be found at the border of Blasted Lands and Swamp of Sorrows

Step 2:
Giver: Fallen Hero of the Horde
Name: Fall From Grace
Description: Talk to the Fallen Hero of the Horde.

Step 3:
Giver: Fallen Hero of the Horde
Name: A Tale of Sorrow
Description: Go through the story of the Fallen Hero of the Horde in his chat dialog.

Step 4:
Giver: Fallen Hero of the Horde
Name: The Stones That Bind Us
Description: Destroy 3 Servants of Sevine, Servants of Allistarj, and Servants of Grol, and 9 Servants of Razelikh.  The process by which to destroy them is to attack them until they become ""banished"" - they go all ghostly and translucent and are invulnerable, then destroy the stone near them.  Be sure to initiate the attack while near the Servant's Binding Stone, otherwise, you will not be able to destroy it.

Step 5:
Giver: Fallen Hero of the Horde
Name: Heroes of Old
Description:  Talk to Corporal Thund Splithoof, another ghost who will now spawn a few feet away, on the other side of the road from the Giver: Fallen Hero of the Horde.

Step 6:
Giver: Corporal Thund Splithoof
Name: Heroes of Old
Description: Open the chest that spawns on the ground next to Corporal Thund Splithoof.  You'll get Shard of Afrasa from the chest as a reward.

Step 7:
Giver: Fallen Hero of the Horde
Name: Kirith
Description: Find Kirith the Damned in the cave in the eastern wall of Serpent's Coil.  He's a 55 Elite freakin huge Felhound.  Kill him, and the Spirit of Kirith appears.  Talk to him to complete the quest and begin the next part.

Step 8:
Giver: Spirit of Kirith
Name: The Cover of Darkness
Description: Go back to the Fallen Hero of the Horde.

Step 9:
Giver: Fallen Hero of the Horde
Name: The Demon Hunter]
Description:  To come when I complete it!

Further steps: I'll post em when I've done em!

As far as I know, the remaining steps are as such:
Talk to the demon hunter in Azshara, and he'll send you off to talk to some guy to get the true name of Razelikh, so he can make weapons to destroy him.  The guy who is supposed to tell you the name will have you go kill some hydra off the east coast of Azshara.  Then he'll tell you the name, which you bring back to the demon hunter.  The demon hunter will then send you off with some felhounds to collect Azsharite to make the weapons.  Once you collect it, he will make the weapons, and send you back to the Blasted Lands.  You will then have to destroy the 3 servants of Razelikh - Sevine, Allistarj, and Grol in order to collect 3 parts of an amulet which will allow you to gain access to Razelikh himself.  This can only be done with the weapons you just received.  Once you've got the amulet, you will be able to use it on the various Runes of the Defiler which can be found around the Mound of the Defiler.  This will teleport you up to the top, where you will have to destroy Razelikh himself.  End of story.  I think. | Subject: ""Continued quest line""
Step 10
Giver Loramus Thalipedes
Name Breaking The Ward

Step 11

For this part you have to travel to Lord Arkkoroc on the island in the north east corner of the bay in Azshara, named the Temple of Arkkoran.

Step 12

Name of the Beast

Kill Hetaera. Killed her with my 58 Pally and a 56 Priest, we found her walking the ocean floor at 59,48.

Step 13

Name of the Beast
Back to Lord Arkkoroc for hand in.

Step 14

Giver Loramus Thalipedes
Name Azsharite

2862,War on the Woodpaw,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2862,"Subject: ""Quest information.""
Here are my findings on this quest at level 44:

Killing location:
Lower Wilds / Woodpaw Hills
Around 76,54

Target:
Woodpaw Trapper (lvl 41-42)
Woodpaw Brute (lvl 41-42)
Woodpaw Mongrel (lvl 40-41)

Drop rate:
Woodpaw Trapper: 64% (11 kills for 7 manes)
Woodpaw Brute: 25% (8 kills for 2 manes)
Woodpaw Mongrel: 13% (8 kills for 1 mane)

Rewards:
~204 XP per kill, 2550 XP Quest Reward, 150 Thunder Bluff Reputation and 45 Silver - at 75,42.

Comments:
Simply roam around the given location and keep killing the Woodpaws until you have all the needed manes. Also, as you can see the Trappers have the highest droprate and the Mongrels the lowest, thus you should try to avoid fighting Mongrols - fairly easy.

~ DeathWise | A good spot for the Woodpaw is 69, 54. Enjoy :) | Subject: ""Where:""
These are SW of the sity, not too far away at all. Maybe a 50% drop rate. | Subject: ""Who to kill...""
I'll just like to add that any woodpaw will do, they all drop the manes needed for the quest. Killing the level 40 to 42 will just make it easier for yourself.

So, Mongrels, Trappers, Brutes, Reavers and Mystics  will all do.

Don't give up, I got my first mane on the 15th kill, so the drop rate -is- low!"

27, 67 in his cove. | Subject: ""Useless Comments""
Comments in which the poster only writes about how easy it was to kill the NPC are NOT helpful. They are boring, self aggrandizing, and a little sad.

It is helpful to post coords or detailed directions to the location for people without Cosmos. It is also helpful to explain what you encountered, but it doesn't help anyone to read over and over again about 'how easy' it was for everyone! Stop bragging and post something useful! | Subject: ""Worth doing""
The cave is at 27,67 or south of Ruins of Solarsal.  There are plenty of nagas, but they are spread out, outside of the cave.  Inside is a different story.

Most of the nagas you encounter are lvl 43-45.  Be careful of the aggro because these nagas run, they will attract other nagas.  To get to Shalzaru, from the entrance, go straight until you see a water.  Hes on the other side. (Make sure to clear out as much of the nagas as possible).  As for the boss, he wasn't to hard. Shalzaru was orange to me, I was level 44 atm, hes 47.  Pulled the guard next to him, and then he came after.  Quickly got rid of his guard and then went on to him. His regular damage for me is 50-55 dmg, considering that I have 3.3k defense.  He casts frost nova every 4-5 seconds which can deal about 200 damage.  Dealing with two of them, brought me to about 1/2 life.  I didn't have to bubble or heal.  The real hard part is getting out :P cuz the nagas spawn so damn fast.  Oh well, heres my chance to bubble =D. | Subject: ""USEFUL INFORMATION""
Don't have Cosmos? Read this.
The Lord Shalzaru is on Isle of Dread, the second island that is located directly south of Feathermoon Stronghold. Simply swim from the Ruins of Solarsal to the island. Continue on a trail until you find a cave entrance. Watch out as many naga are lurking around. If you walk straight into the entrance and don't turn at all, you will soon find two pillars. Walk between these. You should onw be in a room with a pool of water. He is located at the left-most part of this pool. He has 2 guards close to him and several further away. I think he is blue in color rather than the green like other naga. He is level 47 and is simple to beat if you take out his 2 close guards. You may want to set your hearthstone to the stronghold to avoid running through naga afterward. I hope this helps.

Level 45 Hunter | If you're playing Hardcore Classic using the RXP guide add-on, it will tell you to go and solo this quest at level 45-46. My advice is that you don't. Lord Shalzaru, the naga you need to kill for the drop, is all the way at the back of a long cave swarming with naga, some of which have a Frostbolt ability that slows you, and others that Net you for 10 seconds. This cave is one of the biggest hotspots for deaths in all of Feralas. If you're leveling solo and you're not a class that can easily get away from a bad situation, you're better off skipping this quest.

i'm a lvl 43 paladin so i'm a sponge for damage, and i managed to solo this using a few tricks. I died the first time trying to get through the cave i ended up getting slaughtered by 3 sourcerers. While dead I explored the rest of the cave and found that there is a big underwater tunnel east of the island where the naga lord is. I decided to rez and run for the tunnel and dive in; I ended up pulling a whole lot of naga when I ressed but I used the paladins magic sheilds which in total gave me 20 seconds to peg it to the underwater tunnel, thus getting me far enough from the mobs so they ran back to their spawn points.

It's advisable to clear the area around the island before you try and pull the naga guards, and to watch out because the respawn rate is pretty quick. It's possible to pull the guards on the island without pulling the naga lord, i just used the age old sneak as close as i could. The only problem was that they were bother sorceresses so if you can find a handy piece of scenery to put yourself behind they have no line-of-sight and cannot cast on you, therefore that will pull them to you and away from the island. nice exp, a total of about 6800exp (once you deliver the artifact ot the quest givers wife) plus a piece of plate or mail armor. | I suggest to skip this quest unless at least one of the following conditions are true:
you're lvl 48+
you've got a group or higher lvl player help
you are rogue or druid and have stealth
Lord Shalzaru himself is easy even for lvl43-44, but what is hard is to get to him: the cave is full of nagas with extremely fast respawn rate, endless daze and frostbolts hitting for 300-350 damage."

Many thanks to all the posters. I probably would not have had the patience to look for this one-horse burg except for the directions. My 41 Druid stealthed in but they spotted me and attacked. Shifted to the bear and made it up to the second floor where the poor bear died a quiet death. Never had a chance.

Following your instructions, I was not upset at all or worried about corpse campers. Rezzed on the second floor, picked up the shipment of rum (it was surprisingly light...), shifted to bear form and charged down the stairs through hundreds (well, maybe 5) bad guys, all throwing stun as fast as they could.

But I made it out, raced for the water, rinsed off all the blood and whacked three of the big turtles on the way back to the bar. All in all, not a bad quest, mostly thanks to all of you. | Subject: ""LVL 52 warrior""

Upon entering the walled-in camp, turn right and enter that building. Top floor, examine the boxes. | Fun little trick to complete this way under-level: run into the pirate camp and make a beeline for the two-story house to the right. If you can get close enough, and get killed, take your ghost upstairs to the bedroom and you can usually resurrect inside, loot the cargo and hearth (or, since I was on my shaman, Astral Recall) to safety. | Subject: ""Stoley's Shipment""
The walled pirate town in question is not very far south. The trick is to find the entrance to the secluded beach area, you have to go through a short tunnel through the mountain.

aonce in this area, there are guys to kill, but if you don't want to waste your time, make your way carefully over to the fenced in encampment. It is onthe second floor of the building on your right when you enter, it seems to be the only 2 floor building. There are 3 to kill on 1st floor and 3 more in an adjacent room that is half a floor up. The quest item is upstairs. | Subject: ""Suicide Run""
The shipment is on the top floor of the first house on the right as you enter the compound area.

I soloed this as a 45 warlock with my voidwalker.
First I pulled the two pirates on the first floor of the house outside and killed them.

Then made my way inside to the 2nd floor where I got jumped by 3 pirates. Sic pet on one , feared another and took on the 3rd. Ended up dying on the 2nd floor.. rezed with soulstone and RAN up to the top floor.

Shipment is the pile of boxes. Got jumped by 4 pirates used Howl of Terror which sent them running with just enough time to open & collect the shipment before they came back.

Used Howl of Terror again to send them running and hightailed it out of there with about 100 hp left but I survived! having only died once.

Hope that helps :) | Subject: ""Easy to Solo""
It's at 72,46, as you enter the camp the house in your right hand.

I got this in Feathermoon when I was a 43 druid. Wandered up to the ruins, looked at the level of the animals around there (49-50) and am now convinced that some of the game designers at Blizz are smoking something more powerful than Winstons. What would be the point of my carrying this staff in my backpack (actually after awhile I put it in the bank) around for five levels? Am I missing some kind of arcane thrill?

Now that I'm a mighty 47, I thought I'd go back and take a look again. I remembered to take the stave out of the bank, ducked most of the nasty bears and wolves (only had one wolf end up on the dinner table), then attempted to stealth into the ruins.

Well, I might as well have marched in at the head of a Dixieland band. The entire population of Feralas showed up, armed with flamethrowers, bazookas and at least one ex-Russian Air Force nuclear weapon. There were so many fireballs in the air I think my screen got damaged. The Spirit Healer said she wasn't sure if there was enough left to heal.

I plan to try this again as a 62. Seriously, I applaud all you who soloed this but it surely didn't work for me and I didn't get to 47 by killing cows and rabbits. There's a line in this game between exciting and a complete waste of time and I think the GMs need to think a little longer about where the line is. If I had been given this quest at 46 or 47, I can understand. Patience is a virtue and the stave can go in the bank for 4 levels (but why?). But to get this at 43?

Equinex Monolith > 39,13

After you gather all 4 flames, make your way to the Equinex Monolith.

Then right-click the Troyas stave in your inventory. This will consume the Troyas stave and the 4 flames, turning them into the Stave of Equinex.

Then right-click on the Equinex Monolith itself. This will allow you to complete The Stave of Equinex quest and immediately gives you the follow-up quest, The Morrow Stone.

You should have the Stave of Equinex and A Sparkling Stone in your inventory. Check your quest log just in case (bec it's a long run back if you forgot something), and return to Troyas Moonbreeze in Feathermoon Stronghold to turn in. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
All 4 flames can be found in the ruins of Ravenwind.  3 are found normally on the ground in the ruins, 1 is a bit trickyer however. It is on top of a ruined building in the SE corner of the ruins. You have to do some good old fashioned platform jumping to reach it :) | no matter what you do. don't die. the nearest graveyard is feathermoon stronghold. take you ages to run back and no shortcut | Subject: ""Very Easy @ 51""
Three of the flames are very easy to find because they just sit on the ground on bowls. The harpies in this area are 48-50 stuff and very easy kills for my 51 Mage, although they don't seem to drop light feathers. >_> So I just cleared out harpies as needed to get to the flames and monolith. The fourth flame is on a roof of one of the ruins, but if you're practiced in platform hopping it's not difficult to get to. Once you have all of the flames, stand within target distance of the monolith and right click the staff in your inventory. This will energize it and transform it into the Staff of Equinex. Then you can ""open"" the monolith and complete the quest. ""open"" the monolith a second time to receive the Sparkling Stone and accept the next stage of the quest. | Subject: ""Pre-Quest""
You need to complete this quest-chain before this quests becomes available:

Instead of giving you an abundance of useless information (i.e. ""I did it by myself - easy""), I'm going to remind you to do the one thing that I forgot and did not rediscover until I died for the sixth time.

Do you combine the essences? NO.
Do you right click the Monolith? NO.

You have to right click on the staff before you do anything else. Yeah, I forgot I had it in my inventory because it looks like a POS gray staff that drops from random mobs. But yeah, right click on the staff near the Monolith to charge it, then click on the Monolith.

It sounds simple, but you won't believe how many people forget to do this. Hope it helps. | Subject: ""The Stave of Equinex""
Location: Feralas; Fetahermoon Stronghold; 41.35 (To recieve the quest). Ruins of Ravenwind; 40.12 (Samha) 39.9 (Imbel) 38.15 (Byltan) 37.12 (Lahassa) 38.13 (Equinex Monolith and to complete the quest).

Description: Levels 49-50. Basically just run around the ruins and grab the essences. The Samha flame is on top of the ruins, so you will need to climb up it. Just look for the rails that lead up to it. Once you have all the essences, you will need to go to the Monolith. However, you can not turn the stave into the ""Stave of Equinex"" until you actually click on the Monolith first (even though this really isn't part of the quest as you will see a greyed out complete button; therefore it's probably just bugged). Once you click on the Monolith, then you can right click the stave in your bag to complete it. Then click on the Monolith once again to complete and accept the final part of the quest. From there, you recieve the quest ""The Morrow Stone."" Simply return to the quest giver.

- Mobs spawn together and do not split, so you need to kill 5 together.
- The mobs / chest despawn after a few minutes. So if you kill one of them and loot the key and they despawn before you manage to kill the others and loot the chest, you cannot complete the quest anymore unless you farm the map all over again or someone else click on the dam thing to spawn the mobs/chest again.

This is stupidly bugged. | Subject: ""Results""
Once you found all 3 Map fragments(Upper, Middle, Lower), use one of them, then it will combine to the Cuergo's Map, it's a quest.

Go to the Southern Part of Tan, you will see Land's End Beach.
On the Beach, there are a lot of elite turtles.. skip them.
Walk along the cliff side, you will find a triggerable Inconspicous Landmark(it's actually a broken flag), do it when you are ready to fight 5 lev 44~45 normal mob.

You will find the Cuergo's Key on one of them and use it to open the chest under the Landmark =)

I got a schematic and an axe of agility.. well..
I think it's similiar to Captain's Key.. but with 2 green items instead of one o.O...

When I complete it, I am a lev51 rogue. Pretty easy for me to fight 5 at the same time ^^ | This has to be one of the most fun quests in the whole game.

Once you finish the map head south and go to the beach in Tanaris.

Click on the mast once you find it and be ready to run.  Once the timer is done 5 pirates spawn.  If you run immediately they won't attack. 

I was able to then just pull two of them, rinse and repeat till they are all dead.  You need to at least kill one and get the key. 

Rewards were not very good considering the difficulty getting the map parts.

Anyone know what Cuergo's gold (the drink) is good for? | So, you can get quite a few green items if you are patient. Get enough drops from the pirates to make 5 complete maps.

Go down to the area and click on the landmark to start the event. Run away before they spawned pirates can aggro you. Since I was a mage it was easy for me to kill them all with AoE. I think their average level was about 44-45. Loot only one of the bodies for the key, go open Cuergo's lockbox and loot the box you get from completing the quest. Click on another of the maps to start the quest again. Go back and loot one of the other bodies that still haven't been looted, they will have the key again. Repeat until all your maps have been used up. | Subject: ""Guide to getting Cuergo's Gold""
This will be the information EVERYONE would like to know.

How & Where:
To get this chest or quest, you will have to kill pirates East of Tanaris. These pirates are the ones you kill for Steamweedle Port quests, and their location is on the East side of Caverns of Time.

Items required:
To get the items for the quest, you will have to keep killing the pirates until a Pirate's Footlocker. It has a 3.9% drop rate, these Footlockers will give you map fragments, depending on your luck, you may get Lower Map Fragment OR Middle Map Fragment OR Upper Map Fragment which will combine by right clicking one of them into Cuerog's Treasure Map.

Right clicking this Quest Item will begin this quest: Cuergo's Gold

For this Quest, you will need to venture all the way south of Tanaris, you will need to swim along the coast and mountains for abit, before reaching the EXACT PLACE where you can get your Curego's Hidden Treasure.

Level recommended 45+

Reason 1:
There are about 4 Surf Glider level 50 guarding the place.

Reason 2:
5 pirates ranging from level 44-45 will spawn upon opening the ""Landmark"".

Reason 3:
You will need to kill 1 of the pirates to get Cuergo's Key in order to open the chest.

How to do it:
I did it with my 42 druid. What I did was stealth to the ""Landmark"", then wait til the turtles are far enough so I won't aggro them and begin opening, once it is opened, the chest and the 5 pirates spawned, I shapshifted and ran back towards the mountain to prevent aggroing ANYTHING.

I pulled 3 of the 5 pirates and took them down slowly in bear form. I got the KEY. I hurried to open the chest.

HOWEVER, the chest and the 2 remaining pirates DESPAWNED. So, I reopened the ""Landmark"" again, 5 pirates spawned again, I ran back towards the mountains, then went straight for the chest without pulling any of them. Complete the quest, got my chest, and i hearthed out.

I really hope this information will help ALL of you doing this, because there are just too many junks up there.

PS: The chest will most likely give you a blue and greens, but if you only get greens, count yourself unlucky. I got Wirt's Third Leg 2 times out of 3. Goodluck.
Last edited by Uchur on 2019/10/14 (Patch 1.13.2) | If you still can't find the right place or how to get there here is how you do it : First move to 63.63 and then swim all the way down to around 60.86. The treasure is located exactly at 54.95. And for the love of god, do NOT die because you are gonna do a looooong run back from Gadzetzan. Use stealth or stay away from the turtles if you are low level. Now let's say you are ok and safe now and standing at the right point and you can open the treasure. Immediately when you try to open it and the ""opening "" bar fills full, around 8-10 pirates will come, in groups of 2. Me , as a warrior, i used retaliation to counter all mobs but it just wasn't enough. You MUST run As fast as possible to any safe direction. After that , try to pull very carefully a single pirate and loot him for the key | If u loot the key from pirates and die, u cant dig up new chest and it will most likely despawn before u run back from Gadgetzan. If u delete key, it will remove quest and map that gives the quest. | Subject: ""Mast Location""
I found the mast at 54,95. | For those with add-ins such as Cosmos and Titan Panel, the coordinates are 54,93 | This quest is repeatable. So you might wanna bring a couple of those fragments! | Subject: ""Cuergo's Gold""
Solo'ed this, level 50 Arms spec'ed warrior.

Finally found it.....for those wondering, you have to SWIM to the bottom tip of land in Tanaris from that area of coast on the east, lower side. 

Once I made it to the lower land part, I hugged the cliffs all the way around to the west side of that southern tip of island. 

I didn't agro any of those elite turtles this way.

Once I waited for the turtles to walk away from the thing sticking out of the ground, I ran over, gold-wheeled it, and then ran back to the cliffs, on top of the closest little one.

Five pirates spawned, 3 of which ran straight toward the shoreline and stayed.  Two ran up some, closer to me.  After waiting for the turtles to clear, I threw a dagger at the two closer pirates, killed them both, no problem, got the key.

Waited patiently for the turtles to clear once again, ran over and opened the chest.

I received from Cuergo's Treasure:

1. 29 silver, 71 copper
2. Star Ruby (green item)
3. Gigantic War Axe of the Eagle (green, level 41 2-h axe, 91-137 dmg +13 Int, +13 Stam)
4. Wooden leg (gray)
5. A Parrot Skeleton
6. Cuergo's Gold (unique item; Strong Alcoholic Beverage)

Last but not least....of course I hearthed my azz outta there :) | Subject: ""Map""
This quest is for both alliance and horde, The location is on the southern most tip of Tanaris, there is a beach there, you have to swim all the way there to get to it

There are TONS of lvl 48-50 elite Giant Surf Glider turtles dotting the beach, they are aggroable, but yet they don't move or anything. They just sit there.

Blizzard has so many turtles sitting on that beach it's scary.

5 treasure hunters spawn right away, you have to be careful. they are lvl 45ish.

if you run away after opening the mast up they don't attack.

One word for allyall...

WATERWALKING! WOOOT
For all you shamans and alchemists cheer with me!
anywho... this quest aint all that bad.

- Pick up the all the quests for lost rigger cove especially the pirate hat one from Steamwheedle port. By the time you've grinded enough pirates for 20 hats with its HORRENDOUS droprate for 20 pieces you will DEFINITELY have the 3 map pieces.(they come dropped in little pirate lockboxes that arent locked)

- If you r alchemist or shammy this is the part where you cheer! You can mount while waterwalking. If you not an alchem or sham try and buy one, its not all that hard to make, not all that needed, shouldnt cost you much. Open your world map. See that open area down at the bottom area of the map? Over the mountains? thats where your going. WATERWALK

-Mount up and go turtle dodging all the way to the ""inconspicuous Landmark""

-Open and RUN LIKE HELL back into that open area in the mountain

- Kill the one man alone for the key and go open your chest

-free green drop or higher, some vendor trash, and ALCOHOL!

-Now leave.

Really people, this quest aint bad. Just time consuming. Well worth it if you finish multiple maps and go do the quest a few times in a row. | Subject: ""43 Rogue""
Completed it without hassle today as a 43 Human Rogue. Well worth it for me. Didn't even die once. This was my expierience:

I got the map fragments by completing 2 earlier quests involving the pirates in Lost Riggor Cove. I went south to Lands End Beach at the 55,94 region and located the 2 masts (I think they must change position every now and then, as none of the coords here matched).

I 'used' the first mast I found, which spawned the locked chest (requiring Cuergo's Key) and 5 pirates. After realising that the key was with one of the 5 pirates that spawned, I got it fairly swiftly:

By the time the pirates got close to me, I had stealthed (not vanished), and managed not to aggro any of them. They split into 2 groups of 2 and 3. Naturaly, I chose to attack the group of 2. I sapped one, killed the other, used a greater healing potion (about 400 health, not much) and killed the other once he came out of sap. No need for vanish, though I did use evasion. I then opened the chest, without aggroing any other pirates, and recieved Wirt's Third Leg - very handy at my level.

As for the turtles, they were indeed lvl 48-50 but as is the case with turtles, they weren't very aggresive, so I was able to move through them on my mount without aggroing even one. Also, it's worth mentioning that opening the chest doesn't generate any more threat from the turtles - they're not interested in the masts.

Worth it, and easy at my level.

Edited, Sun Jan 29 17:38:58 2006 | First, go to the spot (Lowerest, right corner of Tanaris). There you must find something like anchor with a chest near it.
Second, open the chest and then 5 mobs will appear (they are grouped different).
Third, kill the mobs and 1 will drop key. Open the chest with it and complete the quest.

Rewards are Cuergo's Gold (Drink), some junk stuff and two items, at least green ones. | I found the screenshot location at 51,91. I am using Titanpanel's chords. The area is also surrounded by level 48-50 aggressive turtles called ""Surf Gliders"". A total of 5 ""Treasure Hunting"" pirates spawned in two groups. One group consisted of two mobs the other 3 mobs. I pulled the one group of two mobs and the other 3 proceeded to run away into the ocean.

The Hidden Treasure contained 2 green items, 2 vender items and Cuergo's Gold = https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=9360 | If the chest despawns on you, just delete Cuergo's Key from your inventory and it will let you click on the flag again. | For whatever terrible reason, this quest is worth exactly 0 exp."

The correct coords are: 71,55

The paper is hard to see as it sits flat on a crate near an Alpha, a Mystic, and two Reavers.
(I didn't see it the first few times either!)
Pull the Reavers one at a time and tag the Mystic with the Alpha.
Look REAL close and you will see the paper on the crate, but you have to be standing right next to it to see it.

To do this quest, kill 20 trolls. There is a 100% drop rate and you'll get a Witherbark Skull. Once you've gathered the skulls (you need 20), right click on the Pike that was given to you to ""Use"". It'll make a new pike with the heads on it. Go inside one of the villages and right-click on the new pike and you should get your (Complete).

Most of the village areas have at least one patrol, and the way the stones and walls are setup it's hard to see soemtimes. You can easily get a pull of 3 or 4 if you're not careful.

The troll camp Hiri'watha is at 32,58 in Hinterlands. You need to gather 20 Witherbark Skulls (I got 1 skull from every whitherbark troll kill) and then right-click Nimboya's Pike which was provided to you from quest giver. Your toon then puts the skulls and pike together and you create Nimboya's Laden Pike. Right-click the pike inside Hiri'watha camp and quest is complete. | Subject: ""Great quest (solo as lvl 42 druid)""
I did this quest entirely around one village, which is just south-east of the Alliance outpost Eagle's Nest (around coords 19-21, 55 -- sorry, didn't check while I was there).  The mobs around the village (wolves, eagles) are all range 40-42, as are the trolls you have to snuff.

It's not very hard to pull one at a time, even when you're working your way into the center of the village to plant the spear.  One useful note : the Zealots don't pull a runner when they get low on health; the other trolls will.  And, final bonus, the trolls drop tons of stuff -- each one dropped at least money and a skull (skull drop rate 100%), plus other stuff like mageweave, wildvine, troll sweat, mojo, etc. 

I was rested when I did this, and the total kills plus quest XP (3450) was over 10,000. | Subject: ""31,57""
I placed my pike at 31,57.  That camp is the only one it works at.  Ignore all these stupid posts. | Subject: ""Nimboya's Pike""
First, this quest is not too hard if you are lvl 40 or higher, but I had never been to The Hinterlands before and let me tell you, the path is not obvious. I confused these Witherbark trolls with the ones south of Hammerfall.

Get to Tarren Mill and then walk south-east towards Durnholde Keep. The ""not-so-obvious"" path to the Hinterlands begins just behind the keep (north of the Keep). It's just grass at first but as you head north it will turn into a normal path. There are two giant birds that you can sneak around to gain access to the path, I killed them and they didn't drop anything interesting.

Eventually you will discover the Hinterlands. Don't stay on the path too long, you don't want to head into Aerie Peak if you aren't Alliance. Just south-east of Aerie peak is the Witherbark village called Zun Watha. I walked right in after killing the trolls and it still didn't show onthe map. There is another village (Hiri' Watha) further on but this one will do fine. Plenty of trolls, easy enough to kill and get your 20 skulls fast. Funny thing is that the skulls didn't trigger a counter so keep an eye on your count and when you get 20, click on either the skulls or the Nimboya's Pike in your inventory (I forget which) and then it will create the Pike that you have to place. Walk just inside the village and click on the newly created Pike and it will complete the quest, then you are off to see Nimboya as stated in the quest details. | Subject: ""Another quest starts in the village""
While you're in the village in The Hinterlands killing the trolls, don't forget to use the venom bottles on the table - they start a new quest sequence. | Fun trivia: completed this quest today on Classic, by bad luck my character was RIGHT on the spot the Pike is scripted to be planted, which resulted on me getting stuck / impaled by the Pike without any way to move.

I found him in Durotar at coors 55,74 thats in Sen'jin village | Subject: ""<Blank>""
It seems like a lot of you don't really understand probability.

See, there's a chance every time kill a spider that it will drop the item in question.  Let's say that chance is 5%, or 1/20.

Now, it's probable that you'll get the drop within the first 20 times you do the quest -- probable, because you receive 20 chances to roll the 1/20.  And the average of all people doing the quest will average out to about 20 kills.

That doesn't mean you'll get it within 20, though.  On that 21st try, regardless of the fact that you've already killed 20 spiders to no avail, the chance is still only 5%.  And on that 22nd try, it's STILL only 5%.  It's not impossible that you'd kill 100 or more spiders, still never having hit that percentage.  Call it luck if you like, but extended periods of ""improbable"" missing are to be expected.

All you can do is keep trying.  It's not Blizzard's fault that the computer rolled you up a long streak of &*!@ty numbers.  And keep in mind: it's that same random number generator that just might you a sweet blue weapon drop from a worthless quillboar.

The randomness makes the game, and you gotta take the bad with the good. | Subject: ""thanks""

Big battle - see posts of pictures below | Gadrin's Parchment is a one-use item. If you summon Shadra, the parchment is gone regardless if you actually kill the spider. However, if you don't kill the spider, *abandon the quest* and travel back to Master Gadrin in Senjin Village (Durotar).

Note that this quest is obsolete after the Cataclysm and Gammerita no longer has a quest associated with her.

72, 66 is the entrance to the lower east coast in the Hinterlands. You dont have to jump, there is a path there.

While doing this quest you can also do the quest:
Whiskey Slim's Lost Grog ( you pick it up in Stranglethornvale). | Subject: ""Exploring""
I'll post it here because it was this quest that caused me to start exploring. After taking the pic, I started running north, trying to find path up. I'm night elf rogue and had to HS from Darnassus to Stormwind and fly from there to Aerie's Peak, so my HS had about 50 min cooldown left. I didn't notice any path up so I continued north. And continued some more. Past Eastern Plaguelands (I had to swim some parts and I could walk some parts). Then it said ""Quel'Thalas"" above my minimap. I checked my world map and noticed I'm travelling through Ghostlands! But not by walking, but by swimming.I should've been in the middle of Ghostlands and to the south I see high mountains (couldn't climb over them, tried several times) and to north, the sea. Or ocean or whatever, lots and lots of water. I swam near the mountain base, and, according to some mod that shows coordinates on world map, at 52,19, I found something interesting: a small tower, just like the lighthouse in Desolace, only smaller. And some other ruins. But there was no one there. I searched the place, found nothing and moved on. Eventually, I reached Tirisfal Glades and could get out of water near Scarlet Monastery, can't remember the name of the beach or shore.

So, has anyone else been to the mysterious ruins at 52,19?

Oh, and I play at Vek'Nilash PVP-server. Night elf rogue named Ayami. Damn that was long text."

This one took me a couple tries here even with the above explainations.. I hope this clears it up for others.

Click the pedestal .. then the ghost will appear.

Talk to him  ( all the way through)

The best way I found is to take the side path. If you are on the south side of the Southmoon Ogre ruins there is a path that runs up the mountain and comes out right near the pedastle. There is one giant near but if you are of sufficient level you can avoid aggro and move right up to the pedastle. There is one roamer to avoid as well.

Just click the pedastle, talk to the Stone Guardian, click him again to listen to his story, then click the pedastle again to retrieve your disks. Nice easy 4700 xp at level 49."

I soloed this at 46 doing the following:

- Buffing up as much as possible, using potions, scrolls, etc and putting on my best +Str and +Agi gear
- Clearing out the area around the cage as quickly as possible, -BEFORE- accepting the quest.
- Dashing back up to the questgiver, accepting the quest and jumping into the pool below.  She will follow.  Make land between the two shacks near the sprite cage.
- Pulling any respawns using ranged attacks so they can be soloed.
- Opening the cage and aggroing any latecomers so the sprites can get away.

At this point you need to kill any respawned latecomers since the questgiver will not run away from combat.  But if you were able to clear them out quickly enough to begin with then there should not be that many respawns.

If you fail the quest, abandon it.  You can then attempt the above sequence again.  (I conceived the above strategy on my second attempt.) | Subject: ""<Blank>""
Quest giver is at 65,45, on the ledge behind grimtotem compound above the water.

To get up there, go left of the compound and follow the path behind the tree up the side of the cliff face. | Subject: ""Skip it....""
No, really! I didn't even know this quest existed till I was 60, I knew you could get the pet but didn't bother to look where till now.

So easy it's sad. Lvl 60 NE Druid (resto spec, as if that matters), first I aggroed everything around the cage and general area in Bearform and with a combination of AOE (+spell dmg gear helps) and regular melee/moonfire I killed them all in about 45-50 sec. Then went back to the quest giver and got the quest, I dont know if the respawn time on these guys was changed recently but in that span of time there were a few (3-4) respawns around cage area, or maybe I missed a few. Opened the cage and let the sprites out while I aggroed the respawns, they flew off and the NE and I killed the adds. Dunno where they went but I saw a few dead ones after but still completed the quest.
Of course the rest of the chain is easy as lvl 60 too but I think doing all the ""pet"" quests (There are like 6? quests you can do to get out of combat pets including a worg pup and spider from LBRS as well as the Jubling from the Darkmoon faire all of which are soloable as lvl 60 Druid or Rogue) once you reach 60 is easier and you'll probably have enough bank/bag space to hold them all by then, anyway GL and happy collecting!

Quest Pets:
*Prarie chicken (Alliance only, Westfall (actually you can start this quest by doing the chicken dance with ANY chicken, but the feed can only be bought in Westfall))
*Sprite Darter (Alliance only, Feralas)
*Worg pup (LBRS)
*Spire spider (LBRS)
*Jubling (Darkmoon Faire, BRD)
*Rat, Pig, or Turtle (Orphan Quest)

There are also several pets that you can buy from vendors or are made by Engineers both of which can be sold/bought on the AH also
Vendor Pets:
*Cat (Alliance)
*Owl (Alliance)
*Snake (Horde)
*Prarie Dog (Horde)
*Cockroach (Horde)
*Parrot (Booty Bay)
*Chicken (Mirage Racetrack)
*Frog (Darkmoon Faire)
*Mechanical Squirrel (Eng)
*Mechanical Yetti (Eng)

There are aslo several that are drops
Pet Drops:
*Parrot (Deadmines, Defias Pirate)
*Siameese cat (Deadmines, Cookie)
*Oozeling (Felwood, Oozes)
*Dragon Whelp (Dragon Whelps)

And of course there are the Special Edition or ""Event"" pets
Special Edition/ Event Pet:
*Mini Doom? (SE)
*Panda cub (SE)
*? (SE I know there are 3 special edition but can't remember and I'm too lazy to look up :p If you have the special edition you already know anyway)
*Murky the Murloc (event code)

*Disclaimer: This list may be incomplete or incorrect but not on purpose its just some reference if you are curious. | Subject: ""Completed on first try""
Okay, I'm a 47 hunter and easily completed this on my first attempt.

The path to the quest giver starts at 65,46, facing North east, behind the tree.

Many thanks for the great advice in these posts.  I read as many as I could before doing it to get a feel for what to do.

I cleared the camp ahead of time, this is a must I think as there are quite a few.  I also cleared some of the taurens further away so the sprites didn't run into them.  I then ran up the path (easy to find), grabbed the quest (didn't read it) and jumped off into the water as quickly as I could.  Only two or three had respawned at this point, only one at the cage itself so that was easy enough to take care of.  You don't have to free ALL the sprites, only 6 of them.  I didn't see any dead when I was done though, so I was quite pleased.  I didn't have any damage on myself at all, my pet was virtually unscathed.

Again, all thanks to the most excellent posts in here, great in helping me form a plan of attack. :)

EDIT: Oh, a good tip is to go to your interface options and turn on NPC NAMES under display options.  This helps you more quickly spot where the enemies are.  I usually turn it off  when in a town/city.

EDIT2: WOW, I got 5250 Experience when I went to Darnassus.  Well worth doing this quest.  Plus about 5 bars from killing the Taurens. | Subject: ""Experience/Reputation""
I completed this quest at level 49; I got 3150 XP and an increase in my reputation with Darnassus. | This is the first required quest to get the Sprite Darter Egg.

I soloed the whole quest line and got my pet at level 58, it was annoying because Kindal and the darters you need to save kept starting fights that they were unable to win.

I recommend getting some friends to help you, and that you are at least level 45.

Reward from the last quest is:

I would suggest also getting the flight paths from gadget to theramore, then from menethil to Airie Peak in the hinterlands prior to starting this quest as one of the steps is on a timer. Good Luck and Happy Hunting! | Subject: ""Where to find Kindal""
The loc for the path to Kindal is 65, 46. It is a little hidden behind a tree. When you are facing the camp, it is to the left (west side). | Subject: ""Kindal Must Survive?""
I could be wrong about this, but I think this quest has a Kindal must survive requirement. I attempted the quest solo, followed the mass of Darters when I opened the cage (the req does say I'm supposed to protect the DARTERS after all), and promptly got a quest failed notice having wandered about far enough from Kindal to fail a typical escort quest. I subsequentally was trained by nearly 10 of the various Tauren in the area. Will repeat and stay near/protect Kindal next time.

EDIT: Repeated this today. There was a Rogue who through no fault of their own helpfully cleared out the road leading away from the camp (probably while doing the next stage of the quest). I stayed near the Elf and didn't open the cage until the few repops in the area were dead. The Darters will in fact aggro things you're fighting like a normal escort mob if they're close enough, but a large number of them just took off down the road and apparantly enough of them got away that I got a quest complete very quickly. When you suceed, the elf despawns, but unhelpfully won't respawn back at her starting point to complete the quest for you until the remainder of the six minute timer expires.

Edited, Thu Feb 17 02:40:55 2005 | Subject: ""my solo guide""
Yes, I think this quest is for alliance only unless you hordes can figure out a way to talk to night elves in a friendly tone. I solo this quest with my 45 rogue with absolutely no tanking, no aoe and no CC in combat ability. Don't mean to brag here but Feralas for some reason is so deserted that I can't even find a group.

How did I do it? I simply took advantage of not so quick respawn rate of the mobs. I talk to the NE giving out quest. Both of us jumped into the pond and approached the cage. The NE aggro at least 4 mobs around her. I didn't help and proceeded to open up the cage with the key. Those sprite darters came out and fight the mobs as well. I wasn't able to keep the NE alive. She died and I failed the quest. However, after all this fighting, I was able to clear all the mobs around cage.

Now, I simply abandon the quest and reaccept it again. This time, the NE and I literally walked to and open up the cage without ANY fight. Since there is no mobs around the cage, sprite darters just scattered. There are some mobs on patrol will chase darters, but the quest has shown complete already.

One last point. Between quest is shown complete to NE went back to her original position, there is almost 30sec to 1 min delay. So just wait patiently at the ledge. She'll appear eventually. And I don't believe you need to escort her back.

It took me 2 attempts. First attempt is to clear the path. 2nd attempt is the real rescure mission. Very easy to do if you play your cards right. | Subject: ""Confusing to find""
The coords, 65,45 in Feralas is correct.  There is a wind mill of to the back right of the cage if you are facing the cage door.  Behind the windmill is a tree.  Go to the left of the tree and behind it there is a narrow ""path"" that leads to the two elves.  It doesn't look like a path but it is.  The elves are hard to see cause they blend in with the green landscape.  I spent a lot of time looking else where so I hope helps."

To consolidate some of the previous comments into one post, here are instructions on were they are:

Highvale Notes

Report - 28, 45 | Subject: ""Easy way to barrels""
Barrels are in the East wing. You don't have to go through the front door. Go around the east wall of the building and follow it to the back. You will see a railing along the east wing. You can hop over this railing and get the plans. You will only have to fight about 2-3 mobs this way.

Edited, Fri Feb 25 23:05:11 2005 | Subject: ""<Blank>""
The documents are in the following locations:

Under the gazebo object in the rear of the lodge.

Next to the small well, before the gazebo and east of the lodge.

The last is inside the lodge, in the west wing, you can hop the fence in the back to get to it easier. | Subject: ""More info and FYI""
The mobs here are very frustrating.  They will aggro though the walls and have easily twice the aggro distance.  Even when they were green to me their aggro distance did not diminish at all. >: {
Lastly, they spawn very fast.

Ok the scroll for me for the records was in the East wing so they may move locations like in other grab it quests.

Handy trick:  For east wing entry dont bother going though the front door, go behind where the lake is, hop on the building foundation ledge.  Carefully pull one super annoying elf.  You may have to pull one more for safety.  After carefully clearing the area you can simply walk over the rail.  Yup there is an inviso ramp there that lets you waltz right over and grab the scroll.

If things go sour, dive into the lake and head to the center and wait it out to clear the aggression and try again.

Hope this helps as it saved me a lot of future frustartion. : )"

First, I am not very impressed by the directions on this one, Talo must be losing his memory.

Yes, as he says, they are found west of Mojache, but then they are also quite far north, therefore north-west would be a better description.

Follow the road west adn then north, past the Twin Colassals and just before you hit Desolace you'll see ruins on your left (westof the road). Here you will find many lovely harpies all waiting to be roasted and toasted (Okay I used fireballs). Happy Hunting. | Subject: ""coords""

Be sure to pick up 'Dark heart' quest before you go there, because you have to kill these harpies too, to get the horn, which you blow and kill some boss-bird -> https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1629"

The undead can't be put off so easily. Trolls have some race spells (Shadowguard) but an Undead priest can use ""Devouring Plague"" a useful move in general. Also Undead have ""cannibalism"" which helps restore mana and hp lowering down time. There are a few other reasons like staying under water for longer and crap but I think those are the two biggest points. Truthfully most people I've spoken with would disagree with troll and say an undead priest would be best but I think mostly for shadow spec. As for Holy spec, I would almost say you're SOL because a lot of people are favouring Paladins over holy spec priests now. A paladin/shadow priest combo seems to be a popular thing right now.
Also shadow priest are good at PVP and solo PVE but they have the ability to provide minor group hp and mana healing through ""Vampiric touch and embrace."" I'm not saying holy spec is useless but I'm shadow spec and I get picked before holy on even my most bad days."

72.7, 58.7
67.9, 60.1
58.37, 74.56
Special Note: Edit update, there are newly confirmed timers in play that differ from the original post. If all the spawns are all up at the same time, 2 of them killed are needed to fall within the 6 minute timer rule. We have also confirmed that if all 6 are killed within a relatively short time, they all instantly respawn. If you only kill one, there is an internal timer (unknown as of yet time) that kicks in. This has been witnessed at 1 min all the way up to 1 hour. So noting different spawn timers at this point, is moot. Not because they are true or aren't true, it simply means there are other wanders up that haven't been killed. Another thing to take into account is despawn. If a despawn happens, at this point there is no timer known. Respawn, after despawn, as opposed to kill, is different. Again, there is just no known timer limit. (we have observed 1 and 2 minutes and up to 50 minutes.)

Special Note: There seems to be disputes on timers. Users have reported 7 8 and 9 minutes spawns.

Special Note: Immune to nature damage (IE: Earth shock)

Special Note: Yarol mentioned using your phone for a timer. Added in the classic release is the clock feature (which didn't exist until 2008). If you click on the clock (time), you can use the stopwatch. It is a simple stopwatch, hit the play icon and it will start. Hit the stop or record looking icon and it stops and resets. So for your benefit the timer is indeed available in game.

ElvUI users: right click the minimap, or middle click it (depending on your keybinds) and you will have a clock or timer option.

As the title implies they are Wandering Forest Walkers . Can be combined with the quests Natural Materials, Another Message To The Wild Hammer, and Clamlette Surprise (hint: hover your mouse on the links or click the names to the left to have a map of all the wandering kills, and locations of wandering sightings recorded through the wowhead client). It is entirely possible that you will not see one on the spawn spot, and I suggest before you head to the spawn spot you check the area around the spot. They have a pathing vector that covers the entire area of the map they are on.I will update and edit this post if any other spawn spots are found as precisely as this one. So far we have 3 of the 5 confirmed spawn locations.

Submitted 2 screenshots: One with location and one with the picture.

If you take the road over to the highwilderness and enter the forest by the yeti's and run through the hypogryphs you will find one. Continue over till you get to 54,72 area. You should be on the left side of the ruins. The plateu behind the ruins is where they spawn and they will start their march across the wilderness. If you sit on the path on the left of the ruins, next to the edge of the plateu they will walk right in front of you and you don't have to worry about adds so much.

The only thing is and elite wanderer only spawns every other one. SO you will get one then and normal cursed tree or whatever, then and elite again. I sat and killed 3 in 20 mins. If you are a hunter spam the mana drain shot and they are easy. | Spawn-point of Wandering Forest Walker is at the hippogryphs are: if you are at 57.73, look southeast towards the nearest tree, this particular green tree that sits outside the rim of the Ruins of Isildien that has a brownish-purple tree attached to its right, is the spawning point for this particular mob. It spawns every 4-5 minutes and comes up in front or behind this tree. | Subject: ""The EXACT Spawn Point Is...""
.... Here:

http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/3932/wanderingspawn3dj.jpg

It's behind the main tower of the Ogres, south of the Yetis and Hippogryphs as discussed previously. Simply run south and follow the cliff wall left until you get behind the huge circular tower on your mini map, locate this spot and wait... Mine appeared every 8-10 minutes. And they appear to drop out of the sky when spawning here :) | Subject: ""Coords""
If you sit at 54, 72 all that you will see spawn there are Curse Sycamores...but if you sit at 57, 73 that's where the Wandering Forest Walkers spawn.

Trust me I went through 4 Cursed Sycamores before I tried a new spot listed above in the comments and this spot is dead on. Remember you need Wandering Forest Walkers...the Cursed Sycamores look exactly the same but in this quest it's the name that matters. =)"

3281,Stolen Silver,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3281,"Directly at 58, 53. | The Raptor Grounds are located west of Northwatch Hold. Follow the mountains, and to the south there will be a path marked with raptor nests the whole way. The stolen silver is at the end of this path at another nest, guarded by 3 raptors. In my experience, the front raptor can be pulled, so you only have to deal with 2 raptors. | Subject: ""Raptor Grounds -Directions for those of us that dont us coords""
Directions to the grounds are as follows:

From the Crossroads, follow Gold Road until you pass the Stagnant Oasis. (see your map). When you come to the bridge leading back to Camp T, stop, turn left and follow the empty river bed (or canyon; not a cannon that I hunted for hours for!).

When you see Northwatch come on to screen turn to the right and you will see raptors area. Move into it and it changes to Raptors grounds. You can get Horn quest here too.

Be careful as Plainstriders do attack unprovoked here too. The raptors gang up in 3's sometimes too. As a lvl 18 hunter with a pet raptor, I had a tough time.

The only thing I can't figure out is how to set the darned feathers on the nests! Good luck. PS skinners will get leather here! | Subject: ""Cosmos blows goats""
Geez, for all you people who's answer to ""how do I see coordinates"" is ""Get Cosmos"", you're a bunch of slackwits.

Telling someone to get Cosmos just so they can see coords is like suggesting someone get a full, 7.1 surround sound home theatre setup with 1000 disk DVD changer, tuner and amp, just so they can have a digital clock in their living room.

Cosmos is a bloated piece of crap that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.  There are far better mods out there...including mods simply for adding coordinates to your map.

wowguru.com
ui.worldofwar.net
cursegaming.com
discordmods.com

Those sites are great sources for UI mods. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
Jarnagin you moron, they DID GIVE the CORRECT coordinates.  The exact location of the silver-chest is:  57,54.  I'm standing on top of it right now.  Yes with some mountain climbing and sneaking on the back wall behind the nests, you can get it with minimal fights.  Jarnagin's coordinates are the middle of some Quilboar camp, INCORRECT!  (Unless this chest ""floats"" around, doubtful!"

3301,Mura Runetotem,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3301,"Subject: ""THE CORRECT WAY OF DOING IT!""
Alright, since I was at Camp T when I did this quest, I took the griffin to Org.

From Org, I took the zep to UC, (Optional: Talk to the Bat Rider in UC to get the flight path).

From UC, I took a small road barely west of UC which went south, followed the road all the way to the Sepulcher, and talked to Mura Runetotem at 43, 42. Once you're at Sepulcher, get the Bat Handler flight path so that you can easily fly back to UC. :) (And from there I went to SFK because I was level 23..) | Subject: ""Here's how..""
Ask in Orgrimmar for the Zeppelin and go to Undercity.
Then go to 51,37 and turn right. Then 43,42 and you're done. | Subject: ""Mura Runetotem""
1. From [black]Ogrimmar[/black] go east of the entrance to the Zepplin. [white](Coordinates are 51,14)[/white]. If you can't find it ask a guard where the [Yellow]Zepplin Master[/Yellow] is.

2. Locate [Yellow]Frezza[/Yellow] at the top of the building. The dock behind him should lead you to the [black]Undercity[/black] (talk to him to be sure).

2a. If you wish, once you have gotten off the Zepplin outside the [black]Undercity[/black] head south into the city. Seek out [Yellow]Michael Garrett[/Yellow], for your flight-plan. [white](Coordinates are 63, 58)[/white] If you can't find him, ask a [Yellow]Undercity Guardian[/Yellow] for the location of the [Yellow]Bat Handler[/Yellow]. You will need to take the elevator down a level. Once you have it, return outside (you likely won't have any flights to connect yet). This will make your return swifter.

3. South of where you get off of the Zepplin there is a path. Follow this path southwest (the sign should point it out for you) to [black]Silverpine[/black].

4. Contiune down that path until you reach a fork. At this point turn down the west path (check the sign post to be sure). This path will take you to [black]Sepulcher[/black].

5. If you move pass the gates on this path you will see the indicator on your map showing [Yellow]Mura Runetotem [/Yellow]positions. She is on the left side of the building(inn). [white](Coordinates 43, 42)[/white]

5a. If you got your flight-plane in UnderCity eariler, just talk to [Yellow]Karos Razok[/Yellow], the bat handler and he can take you back to [black]Undercity[/black].

Experience Gained: [Blue]1050 experiance[/blue]
Reputation Gained: [blue]100 reputation for Thunder Bluff[/blue]

Note: This quest does not lead to Hamuul Runetotem. Altered Beings lead to both this quest and Hamuul Runetotem.

1.  Look on your Map, walk to the edge of the cliff to the crane that has a chain going into the Cauldron chasm..it is near the ""C"" of the word ""Cauldron"" on your map.

2.  Drop onto the iron work and then down to the path.  You will be in front of the most Eastern cave (the ""first"" cave).

3.  Enter the cave, killing as you go.  Cross the iron bridge and enter the room.

4.  As you enter this room, you will see the red glow from two exits. One to your left, and one straight ahead.  Go directly across the room.  Do NOT enter the doorway to the left (which contains Overeer Maltorious and his henchmen).

5.  Exit the room via the doorway directly across from the way you entered; go down the ramp.  The Lost Archeologist is in the center of the room at the bottom of the ramp (to your left). | Just because I am an idiot, make sure you remember that this is underground in the caves, not on the top level. I was walking around those coords and was thinking, what the hell.

Then I realised what was up. hah | Subject: ""Locations""
The cave is the one at 49,44. Best way to get there is to go to 48,41 and jump down. When you're at the cave the guy you are searching for is at 41,25. Enemies inside the cave are level 46-48. Hope this helps. | Subject: ""tips on finding him""
Follow the other directions to fall into the hole at the Slag Pit.  Walk north/northeast until you're under Thorium Point on the map.  You'll see a big opening with a pink glow leading into the cavern where he's at.  There's a helpful yellow question mark guiding the way. | I took the North/East Cave entrance into ""The Cauldron"" and ran past just about eveything... Talked to the little Dwarf that was laying down and that was about it! The cords are 41,25 Inside ""The Cauldron"". Also posted a screenshot above. | Subject: ""<Blank>""

In order to loot the artifact you have to jump into the lava and stand on it the artfact. | Subject: ""Location of Alter and Item""
Hey guys this is actually located in the Firewatch Ridge. Before you get to the cave coming from Thorium Point there is a camp fire and wagon, you take a right and continue up the mountain. It is ELITE! ther is about 10 Elites at the alter and you need a group of atleast 2(if the other is a healer) should try and do it with three. You cannot solo this. Then after you find and kill everything around the lava pool get on top of the item to open or you will diefrom standing in the lava. Grab the item then get the quest form the night elf in the cage next to the lava pool( good xp and nice plate bracers). Take the artifact back to the dying dwarf in the Slag Pit and this unlocks the obsidion Quest. Kill all the dwarves around the area before you fight obsidion and his master both 52 Elites. Have fun! | When someone starts ""Rise, Obsidion!"" the altar is not klickable for a long time... just wait (more then 10 min) | Subject: ""Location of the Mysterious Artifact""
The Mysterious Artifact is in the middle of a lava pool directly west of Thorium Point.  To get there, go south of the flight point to Firewatch Ridge and head west towards the cave.  Do not go inside the cave.  Instead, look to your right and find a path going up the mountain.  Follow it and look for some more torches lighting up the path to your right.  At the end of that path, you'll see the said lava pool and the Mysterious Artifact.

Be careful.  Elite mobs guard this area, but they can be pulled individually, even the ones surrounding the lava pool.  Once you've cleared it, you can jump onto the Mysterious Artifact to loot it, since wading through the lava pool will hurt and eventually kill you. | The Altar of Suntara is in the slag pit by the Dying Archaeologist. Has a bunch of candles."

In the following, I will describe in detail how to find Sharptusk and other helpful hints. Good luck! :)

Alright. So you've gotten the quest? Now, here's what you do:
1. Head to the Brambleblade Ravine, which, on your map, is in the lower right-hand corner. Find the cave-like enterance, which leads to a clearing with pigs and humanoids. The camp is marked with large, green thorns.
2. You'll see that there's a wall directly opposite you when you walk into the clearing of the Ravine. Killing the enemies along the way, go straight to the wall opposite you.
3. Follow this wall to the first clearing you can go between. Turn to face the opening in the canyon.
4. There will be three paths to choose from here: straight, left and right . Choose straight .
5. After turning a corner, you will see another fork.. this time for right and left . Choose right .
6. Now you should see a clearing with many Quilboar, and on a little hill in front of you, a large tent.
7. Clear the Quilboar outside the tent, then proceed inside to kill Sharptusk for your reward!

Now, that wasn't so bad, was it? Okay, time for a few ""Extra Tips""...

1. When you get to step 6 and see the final clearing and Sharptusk's tent, there's a path going right up to a cave. It's not an exit, as I thought, but if you clear all the people inside, there's a map on the cave's floor that begins a quest.
2. The large green thorns can be climbed on for quick mana/health breaks.. however, I wouldn't suggest AFKing here, because enemies can climb them too.

Good luck and happy holidays,
Kaydaa and the Boanbimo Goonies :). | Coords: (64.77)

Or else follow ewarlocks advice. I'm sure it's correct. (I entered at a different place and pretty much just ran about the place). | Welcome, young Tauren, to the first step in the vast plains of Mulgore and Azeroth beyond! I've paused to just post a small list of quests you should be sure to pick up before venturing into the Brambleblade Ravine area...

- Rite of Strength: Collect the belts off of the Quillboars inside the ravine. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=757)

- The Battleboars: Kill these piggies in the clearing in front of the ravine for their meat and snouts. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=780)

** Attack on Camp Narache: For an extra quest, head up the path going right [near Sharptusk's tent]. Kill the boars inside and click on the map on the cave floor to begin the quest. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=781)

* Shaman: The Quillboar shaman within provide the salve you need for your Call of Earth quest. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1519)

My post is quite vague, but it's merely a set of guidelines. Feel free to act as you wish. After all, I am not you, you are you! Have fun, and may you have the Earthmother's blessing. | Subject: ""Coords""

STILL unfinished or something. I was doing the Asharite quest when I fell down a gap. I ressed and found this q - thought I would do it for fun and to see what reward I would get.
Horribly disappointed I didn't get anything at all - 600XP when at level cap = biggest waste of time ever.
And a waste of runecloth ;)
If it isn't finished, why can't they just pick some random green weapon and have that as reward or something? Or just junk the quest all together until it is done?
U can't even loot the naga! | Subject: ""wtf""
After I did this quest and only got 600xp I started it again and let everybody get slaughtered by the Naga -- then I felt better. | The final wave the crew decided not to help, so I ran far enough away to be out of combat and then went back and waited for the naga to despawn (they just stood around and didn’t attack the crew) as soon as they did I got credit for a complete quest.

She mentioned at the end to speak to other crew members (reading the other threads I found out this step is not implemented at the moment) these were the crew members I could find … none of them spoke to me, though

Second Mate Shandril – on the island watching over the debris
Roland Geardabbler – In sunken ship
Horizon Scout First Mate – In sunken ship
Horizon Scout Engineer – In sunken ship
Horizon Scout Cook – In sunken ship
Horizon Scout Crewman – 7 one on shore before the valley leading to the Captain and six more at her side.
Captain Vanessa Beltis
Patrick Mills – Fights beside the captain
Alexandra Blazen – Fights beside the captain
Lindros – Fights beside the captain | Subject: ""Very easy AoE""
I found these guys by accident while exploring the beaches and the quest does the same thing at lvl58. Very, very easy for a mage - just put up mana shield (frost ward helps too, but isn't necessary because they die so fast) and nova them right at the little gate where the crew is hiding behind. About 5 or so arcane explosions was enough to finish off each wave of the naga, so plenty of time between waves to refuel mana. It's disappointing that you can't loot them because soo many corpses. >_> | 2019, the relaunch of classic and blizzard decided to keep this broken quest. Still 600xp and nothing. Great bait. | Subject: ""Quest is Bugged at this time""
At this time, this quest is bugged. You cannot loot any of the naga, so you can't grind them for Golden Pearls. | Subject: ""nothing new after the patch""
iv done it like 5 minutes ago with my 60 lvl character, gained 600 xp, no gold whatsoever and its still repeatable :) but hey , a least the pirates are safe! | Nothing, zip, nada after this patch either. The quest is repeatable though, my guess is some broken handle or trigger. That, or they just haven't made the rest of the quests yet. | Subject: ""Buggy?""
According to Blizzard GM:

The issue reported above is not considered to be ""broken"" and should be
functioning normally. If you feel that the functionality should be
different, then please visit the Suggestion Forum
(http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.aspx?fn=wow-suggestions) and
post a suggestion. These forums are regularly monitored by the World of
Warcraft development team.

It seems that this quest is functioning normal.  It just ""seems"" buggy to everyone but the GM. | Still as others have said:

Crew doesn't help fight last wave.

Minimal XP, no reward.

Repeatable.

No reason to do this unless you're feeling completionist, but even then, it doesn't get marked as completed. | Subject: ""Unfinished quest""
It seems this quest is unfinished. The Captain hints at being able to talk to her crew for further quests once this quest is completed, but none of them have a thing to say.

And yes, the quest is repeatable. Very fun quest, too bad it's unfinished and so hard to get to. | Subject: ""lv50 solo""
""Soloed"" this quest at level 50 (with the help of her crew).  Too bad, still only 600xp *groan*. | Subject: ""Still still there.""
I got lost swimming around the continent and ended up in their camp, I wandered here thinking I had missed something (lvl57 quest only 600Xp) but I guess not.
Did it twice and didn't notice the crew not helping the first time when I had help from my buddy, second time he was afk and I got stomped when the crew didnt help me (lvl 54 trying to solo 5 lvl 49 Naga).
Repeatable is ok I guess and if they really dont kill the crew and despawn at the last wave and you still get xp then its even easier because as long as the crew is helping you its easy. Only that last wave when you have to solo is hard.

Actual XP Gained: At lvl 54 I was getting 19-20xp for each naga (I was in a group of 2) 4-5 waves of 5 plus the 600 for quest complete, you should get about 1000-1200xp total for about 5-10 minutes of little work. Not too bad but still not great and would be nice if you could loot the naga that attack. | Subject: ""Re: A Crew Under Fire [3382]""
20 May 2007

Soloed with 52 hunter and pet (plus crew).

Minimal mob XP, no completion XP, repeatable.

i.e. No change since April."

If you were paying attention when you got the quest, the mage tells you to go to the hangar in the Warrior Guild, where you have to talk to the pilot.  He gives you a flare gun, which you fire at the helipad to signal him for pickup.

If you didn't do that part, you'll have to cart the rubbings pack to Ironforge so you can get the flare gun then take them back to Aszhara so you can signal the pilot so he can fly them to Ironforge...no, this doesn't make sense. | Subject: ""How to get the rubbings""
Level 56 Night Elf Hunter from the EU server Nordrassil

I am writing this comment, following my having been severely confused, while trying to get the rubbings of the runes required.

Amidst the ruins of Eldarath in Azshara, you will find a lot of glowing stones, looking like tombstones of sorts or with some ancient Nordic runestones found in Sweden and Denmark. On them, is carved a symbol that remotely resembles the Nordic Rune Sig, to put it simply an ""S"" like symbol. This symbol emits a yellow or purple or blue glow, that alternates ""occulting"" between a strong and a faint glow. THESE ARE NOT, I REPEAT NOT, THE RUNESTONES YOU ARE LOOKING FOR! I couldn't emphasise this more, as these Runestones got me confused in the first place.

This is Blizzard's fault, as the quest log speaks vaguely about mere ""runes"", failing to clarify.

You are not looking neither for runes, nor for Runestones; you are in fact looking for OBELISKS, again to be found in the ruins of Eldarath in Azshara. What Blizzard erroneously calls ""runes"", are in fact tall, Egyptian-style obelisks, that remind me of:

a. The Obelisk monument in Washington DC.

b. The Egyptian Stele (or obelisk) in London.

c. The Rosetta stele of the French Egyptologist Champollion.

What you are looking for is in short terms, tall and slender Egyptian-style obelisks standing approximately 10 meters high with a light blue gem embedded near the top, not a Runestone as we know it in Europe, or a ""Rune"" as we know it in Europe. On these quest obelisks, there are no visible runes carved, neither Nordic runes nor some sort of hieroglyphic.

Very confusing quest, as Blizzard has failed to adequately describe what is sought. I really hope this comment will help people. | Tymor also sends you to pickup a flare gun in IF to be used once all runes are collected: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3450. Fire the gun on the helipad | Subject: ""Easy 10K+ xp""
The coordinates given here for the obelisks are spot on and made finding the runes very easy. Much thanks to those who posted them. ^_^ If you don't have access to coordinates (well everyone does, just make a macro button to spit them out) finding the obelisks isn't too hard. Follow the main road East through Azshara until you get to the ruins. If no one has killed it yet, you should see Naga on a ramp going uphill in front of you, but on the right there should be a ramp leading downhill. Follow the ramp down to a lower level where the 49-52lvl stuff is and continue straight ahead until you reach the first obelisk. If you keep going East, there should be a round building on the minimap which is an Elf temple. Two more of the obelisks are on either side of the temple, one North, one South. To find the last obelisk, follow the ridgeline of the cliff Southeast from the temple and you will find it not too far away.

To get to Pilot Xiggs, I swam through the Bay of Storms. There is a ramp at the south end of the ruins that leads down to the beach. Once down to the water, there's lots of 53-55 stuff in there including elite giants, so be prepared. Instead of following the shoreline, I swam due East out into the south central area of the bay and found very few mobs to avoid out there. (Also found an island with a NE Warlock on it O.o;;) Then turned due south and swam across the Eastern point of the peninsula to the Island with the landing pad on it. You have to stand on the pad and fire the flare gun, Xiggs shows up, port to IF, easy 10K+ xp for 52 mage. ^_^ | Hello,

After you get this quest be sure to get the flares from deep end of the military ward before you head out to the ruins of eldarath in azshara to collect the rubbings then you should head to south east to the lil peninsula loc 77,91 and shoot the flare on the helipad you get 2250xp for the the pick up and 7800xp more aloung with a nice 342ac 11str 11sta boot or 12 int offhand once back in If not to mention the 10-20k xp you will prob make trying to collect the 4 rubbings | Subject: ""LOCs""
These Locs are for Cosmos. Here is a link if you want to downoload it. I suggest the release version: http://www.cosmosui.org/

Edited, Sat Mar 12 14:56:28 2005 | Subject: ""Excellent quest""
This is an excellent quest.

The only gotcha is finding the Rune of Sael'hai. The other three runes are in the area labeled Runes of Eldarath. All four runes are outdoors so you don't have to fight your way into any temples.

After getting all the runes, swam underwater along the Southridge Beach to the small island southeast of the southern peninsula; it had an easy to spot landing ramp on top of it. I used a Deepdive Helmet to avoid most of the level 51 – 55 mobs along the way. | Subject: ""coordinates macro""
You guys don't need cosmos, simply use this command:

/script px,py=GetPlayerMapPosition(""player"")
/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(format(""[ %s ] %s , %s"",GetZoneText(),px,py));

copy and paste that exactly then create a button macro that activates it. You'll get a long stream of numbers like 42.0032423490 just ignore the numbers after the decimal point. Then whenever someones says cosmos coords or cordinates, you'll have the function, no add-on needed! | Subject: ""LOCS""
here are the LOCS for thouse Obeliscs (Runes)...

Rune of Sael'hai: 42, 64

Happy Clickin' ;-) | Subject: ""Solo'd Lv48 Mage no deaths, Important things to remember...""
The hardest part of this quest is not finding the runes or sketching them, the hardest part is getting to the helipad in one piece. Along the northern and southern shores towards there, there are lv53-55 mobs both on the shore and in the water...and lv55 murlocs that will resist a hell of a lot and chase you a long way.

The waters around the helipad are full of mobs. Always go via where the mobs are furthest away from it so by the time you get there they will turn back.

Whether you choose to go by water or land KEEP moving when aggro'd eventually they will turn back after a while. If you stay to fight you'll probably die from surrounding mobs joining in.

If you choose to go by land to get as close to the helipad as possible before the water, beware of the elite Giants. They may be slow and you can outrun them but they hit very very hard.

Lastly don't fall off the cliff where the runes are, because you will need to go all the way round to get back up via the north part of the map which is festering with lv53-55 mobs and several elites very near each other.

Last few hints: use your mount a lot, healing, swimming and running potions will definately save your life!

Best of luck, the quest isn't tough but trying stay alive heading the helipad will be.

PS. Remember to get the signal flaregun before you leave IF, you will need it for the helipad. | Subject: ""Fuselighter""
This quest screwed me up too, I should have read the threads before I started it.  Okay, getting the rubbings is cake, the island wasn't too difficult to find either.  HOWEVER before you leave on this quest, go to the Mystic Ward (TO the Ward, not IN the Ward!).  If you're facing the steps to the Mystic Ward from the Water Pit area, look to the right any you'll see an undesignated building (No signs outside).  Inside that building is a Dwarf named Tymor standing upstairs, he'll give you the quest to talk to Fuselighter in the Military Ward to get the flare gun to be picked up from the small island after you get the rubbings.

Good luck folks."

Okay,

If you can move this post to the top so eveyone can see it you better.

I have been told by blue, that you do give up the trinket for the exp.  The quest ends there.  There is no more to it.  The text reads as thou it goes further on but it does not and there is no more supportive content to the quest.

I'll honestly say, the GM I spoke with seems as upset as I was about it, and made it very clear that the quest ended there.

If you like the trinket, keep it.  I wish I had, but if you want the exp fine, it's a poor trade if you ask me.  There outa be a nice weapon, gold or something for all that you go thru to get the trinket. | This quest chain seems to be an incomplete one.

After you turn in the Chained Essence of Eranikus to Itharius and go to visit Umbranse, the chain dead ends with its completion. He will not point you to another questgiver or give you any task to complete. Though it would seem that what he says would, logically, lead to another part, it does not, which is a disappointment.

Messages to the GMs and on the forums have yielded nothing except messages that the quest is ""working as intended"".

It is a real Shame Blizz didn't finish the questline this time around... considering the relevance of the state of the game/zones/population and patch etc.
Would be nice to see this qchain added in, along with the long-lost Ashblade Quest that ppl thought was/will be obtainable ingame. | Subject: ""In Eranikus' Own Words completed""
Umbranse the Spiritspeaker is at 68,27

He gave me 2 gold, 52 silver and nothing else.  Like everyone else, I wish I had kept the trinket | Well they've had 12 years to update this.

Any update? | Subject: ""Not much of a supprise...""
...but this quest is still broken at this step, as of 4/16/07

Just sayin' ^^ | Subject: ""Update from Blizzard""
""More will be added to the Eranikus quest chain in a future patch (not sure how far off as of right now). I can't reveal anything further at this time, but from what I've seen it's going to be really cool and fairly rewarding.""

from Eyonix on the official forums (posted 2005-08-30)

EDIT: added date | I spoke with a GM today (04-01-2007) and he confirmed that this quest is indeed broken and will be fixed sometime in the furture. | Subject: ""Eranikus isn't a god""
/Sigh

Why do ppl post garbled information here...Eranikus is an Emerald Dragon, one of Ysera The Dreamers brood, he was set to gaurd Hakkar's remains after the emerald flight destroyed him, Hakkar is the god of the trolls who dewelled withing The Temple of Atal Hakkar...Now commonly known as the sunken Temple, if u actually read the quest log instead of just twisting words u'd know this. the corruption of hakkar twisted the emerald dragons set with eranikus to guard the remains of the troll god, upon his death at ur hands his essence was trapped within a nightmare...again information that was given in the quest line.

oh and BTW quest items don't always need to have a quest attached to them, and some will only drop once u have completed other quests...the onyqia key quest chain springs to mind, why don't u try searching thott for the term ""augurary"" or whatever the precise spelling is. | Subject: ""Umbranse the Spiritspeaker""

For those of us who do things the old fashioned way cause Coords mods give bugs to our comps! :)

If you start from Valormok and head along the foot of the hills going east, you will see a Blood Elf standing with a blue question mark over his head. Talk to him and he teleports you up to the mountain. Follow the path up the mountain to the tower and walk in. I found the Archmage wandering around on the top floor but he slowly makes his rounds through out the entire tower. Cozy little place he has. And he looks bad-ass to boot! :D

When you are ready to leave, head back down to the Apprentice you saw when you first got there. He teleports you back down and then you insert your own cut-scene of you riding away victoriously.

When findind the Blood Elf, be careful of the Spiders and the Naga. You can easily ride through them but they are bothersome. Also, if you are in the midst of angry Timbermaw, you have gone too far. Turn back around, follow the foot of the mountains till you see the Blood Elf again. Worse comes to worst, you end up needing to start the search from Valormok again.

Hope this helps. :)

3601,Kim'jael Indeed!,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3601,"You can just loot the same box over and over again. Just wait for the box to respawn. Can be found on the hill with Blood elves or near the cliff. These blood elves hit little bit hard, but can be easily killed. | Subject: ""Finding Kim'jael & a side note""
To get this quest, players need to go out of their way to find the quest giver, Kim'jael (for add-on users, location coordinates are 53,22 ... he's atop the hill).

On a side note, when players try to approach Kim'jael from west side of the map (where Ashenvale Forest is located), they normally pass by Timbermaw Hold.

One humble advice: if you care about faction reputation stuff, avoid killing the Timbermaws!

They belong to the same tribe as the Timbermaws in Felwood-Winterspring border. Killing them makes them just that much harder to gain good reputation with them. Potentially a bad idea, since becoming chummy with Timbermaws can bring some tangible rewards.

Edited, Thu Jan 5 09:08:49 2006 | Subject: ""Easy""

The quest text sort of implies that Wildkin Feathers are dropped off the Owlbeasts themselves. After spending over an hour hunting these fools, I realized they do NOT in fact drop off the mobs. Instead the feathers are clickable items found on the ground in the areas where these Owlbeasts reside. Hope this helps! | The drops here are feathers that are found on the ground (not by killing anything). They take some wandering around to find properly - however, a lot seem to drop around Quel'Danil Lodge around (33,47). | Subject: ""Piece of cake!""
Very easy quest, soloed this on my level 43 Paladin. All you have to do is run around the Hinterlands and open up the feathers you see lying on the ground. I went over to Quel'Danil Lodge, the mobs there are friendly to Alliance, and I collected about 10 feathers just around the lodge. 15 feathers and not 1 mob killed = easy quest xp. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
The feathers are red, white, and blue and contrast with the grass pretty sharply.  So, you should be able to spot them without having to resort to eratic cursor waving.  It seemed that they spawned most frequently in the area between The Altar of Zul and Agol'Watha. | Quest starts in the village that has the teleport to Darnassus, NPC is at 55,92.

Good Luck! | Subject: """"Correct location""""
THERE IS NO CONSTANT LOCATION. The pile of Glinting Mud apparently spawns randomly. Mine was all the way at the western tip of the lake. The easiest way to do this quest if you can't turn into a seal is to skim the top of the lake (so as to keep breathing) and look for Glinting Mud next to all the rocks on the bottom of the lake. It is a darkly colored mound that is much larger to all the little white things on the bottom. The most important thing to remember is just because someone posted their coordinates doesn't mean they will be true for you. | The necklace can be found in a pile of mud on the bottom of Lake Everstill, see https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=154357 for location. | Confirmed in classic.
+100 with Stormwind. (110 for humans) 1,350 experience
+100 rep for (silent) horde bar. 1,350 experience
Horde players can indeed do this quest.

Glinting mud contains Hilary's Necklace (hint: hover your mouse over the glinting mud link to see a small map with spawn locations)

The spawns are random and can be as far away as the other side of the lake, to as close as directly under her.

Edit: Updated to correct rep gain. Thank you Edyg.

This information should be accurate as of patch 1.11.2
-------------------------------
Morrowgrain quests:

The Morrowgrain quests can be quite involved as there are two quest givers and turn-in locations. Also the rewards given are different for both turn-in locations. The actual process to get Morrowgrain takes several steps as well.

The quest line starts with a quest called Morrowgrain Research which is given out by Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm. Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm may be found at Thottbot coordinates 35,8 in Darnassas. He is located at the top level of the Druid complex (Cenarion Enclave). He asks you to take a packet of 20 Tharlendris seeds to the middle level of the same complex and give them to Mathrengyl Bearwalker who gives out the next quest. That quest is also titled Morrowgrain Research (Just to confuse things).

The second Morrowgrain Research quest has you take a special pouch called an Evergreen Pouch (Provided when you receive the quest) and put into it 2 Un'Goro Soil (Collected in Un’Goro Crater) and 1 of the Tharlendris seeds from the packet (First 10 seeds given to you with the quest). With 2 Un'Goro Soil in your backpack along with 1 Tharlendris seed, you right click the Evergreen pouch. The pouch will plant the seed into the soil and grow an Evergreen Herb Casing. When you right click the casing, out will pop a random herb. One of the herbs grown may be Morrowgrain. When you have 10 of them you turn them in to complete the quest. You can repeat this quest as many times as desired. You can grow a new Evergreen Herb Casing once every 10 minutes.

There is a second parallel quest line involving Morrowgrain as well. This chain of quests starts with either Innkeeper Shyria in the Inn of Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas or with Tannysa the Herbalism trainer in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind. Talking to either of these two people will give you a quest titled Jonespyre's Request which asks you to go talk to Quintis Jonespyre in the Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas. Quintis Jonespyre will then give you the repeatable quest titled The Mystery of Morrowgrain. This quest is identical to the above quest (Use the Evergreen pouch to grow an Evergreen Herb Casing from 1 Tharlendris seed and 2 Un'Goro Soil and out pops a random herb) except you only need to turn in 5 Morrowgrain.

In the end, you now have two locations to turn in Morrowgrain:

Turning in 5 Morrowgrain to Quintis Jonespyre in the Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas will give you 25 reputation with Darnassas. In addition he also gives you another packet of 10 Tharlendris seeds so you can go out and grow more.

Turning in 10 Morrowgrain to Mathrengyl Bearwalker at the Cenarion Enclave in Darnassas will earn you 50 reputation with Darnassas. In addition he also gives you a Cenarion Circle Cache. Opening this will provide a random number of items as loot. Typically there are 4-8 items in the bag although I have seen only 1 before and as many as 14 per Cenarion Circle Cache. The Cenarion Circle Cache typically contains food, drinks, scrolls, potions, herbs etc. For a list of the types of items found in each Cache please see the following link: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=5533/ilkrud-magthrulls-tome You can get a lot of really good stuff in these caches.

Where to get Un’Goro Soil: Un’Goro Soil is found in Un’Goro Crater (Southern end of Kalimdor). Un’Goro Soil is dropped (from Dinosaurs) throughout the crater. Just run around the zone (Avoiding being stepped on or eaten by the dinosaurs) and right click the dirt piles you see laying on the ground. Un’Goro Soil is often found in the AH as well. Un’Goro Soil stacks up to 100 units per stack now.

Where to get Tharlendris seeds: Tharlendris seeds may be purchased from either of the two turn-in NPCs or you can get them as part of your turn-in reward when you turn in Morrowgrain to Quintis Jonespyre in the Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas.

Where to get an Evergreen pouch: An Evergreen pouch is given to you when you receive the second Morrowgrain Research quest. Replacements may be purchased (For around 1 Gold) from either of the two turn-in NPCs.

The rewards:

Once you have grown Evergreen Herb Casings and retrieved the herbs out of the casings you can either turn in the Morrowgrain for reputation, sell it on the AH or use it to make Cenarion Herb Bags (Manufacturing 20 slot herb bags requires 8 Morrowgrain as one of the materials to make 1 bag). In addition the loot from the Cenarion Circle Cache is typically valued at several gold and may be used or sold as needed.

In addition to growing Morrowgrain, the Evergreen Herb Casings often contains other herbs which may be used or sold as needed. How much Morrowgrain or other herbs you grow and which types depend on your Herbalism skill. As an example, I dropped the Herbalism profession completely and grew 65 Evergreen Herb Casings. Out of those casings I received the following:

Morrowgrain 50
Kingsblood 6
Gromsblood 3
Earthroot 9
Briarthorn 8
Liferoot 7
Mageroyal 5
Sungrass 2

For a total of 90 herbs averaging 1.48 herbs per Evergreen Herb Casing. For the most part these are lower-end herbs.

I relearned Herbalism and worked it up to 300 skill level. I then grew 65 more Evergreen Herb Casings. This is what I received from those:

Morrowgrain 75
Kingsblood 22
Gromsblood 2
Liferoot 6
Sungrass 5
Stranglekelp 13
Blindweed 5
Goldthorn 22
Firebloom 2

For a total of 152 herbs averaging 2.34 herbs per Evergreen Herb Casing. For the most part these are higher-end herbs. The maximum # of herbs out of any single casing is 5.

As I went up in skill level, the numbers and types of herbs increased steadily.

All in all 300 Herbalism will result in a 50% increase in Morrowgrain output and a 70% increase in the number of herbs grown as well as large increase in the value of the herbs.

Most people performing the Morrowgrain quests keep the pouch, seeds and soil in their backpack and as they run around Azeroth they pop out a new batch of herbs once every ten minutes. For an Alchemist this results in a steady supply of herbs for use in potions and for others it results in a steady supply of cash from the sale of those herbs. The hardest part is having enough space in your bags for all those herbs!"

3803,Morrowgrain to Darnassus,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3803,"Based on drop rates and reagents needed..

for Revered to Exalted you need 21000 rep
21000 / 75 = 280 turn-ins
280 turn-ins = 2800 Morrowgrain

Morrowgrain drops approx 37.9% of the time according to wowhead stats, but drops 1 - 5 morrowgrain each time it does.
at 2.5 morrowgrain per drop, 37.9% of the time - you will need roughly 425 Evergreen Herb Casings.

Casings are made from 2x Un'Goro Soil and 1x Packet of Tharlendris Seeds, so this means 850 soil and 425 seeds.
The seeds are sold by a vendor in Darnassus for 10s each (is this affected by rep?) therefore the seeds will cost you 42.5g

Un'Goro Soil drops most in Un'Goro Crater from the Gorishi bug things, roughly 1/3 of the time, maybe a bit more. This means you will need to kill around 2500 of these mobs to get your soil, assuming you don't pick any soil up from the ground. If anyone can estimate how long you'd be killing mobs to get that done and how often you'd come across a pile of soil that'd be wonderful.

Last on the list is the 10 minute cooldown on cultivate seeds, this means that once you have spent your 42.5g to buy packets of seeds, and killed your 2500 Gorishi mobs to collect 850 bits of soil, you need to spend 70 hours and 50 minutes cultivating them. I suggest you do it while you grind tbh. | The reason it is repeatable is because if your not a NE then you can do this quest over and over and over and over and over and over (you get the idea) again to get exalted status with Darnassus so you can get a sabre.

she's at 80,45 | To get the Sha'ni, follow the red lava path up from 77,51. | Subject: ""NOT SEARING GORGE PPL!!!""
I had trouble with the coords above too. I saw the mountains and couldnt get up there. Unlike others, I only tried for 5 min or so before I RE-READ THE QUEST! AN IMPORTANT STEP PEOPLE! It is a badlands quest and I think most people read over it casually and didnt see the fact that this is located in the BURNING STEPPES, not the SEARING GORGE, located right next to the Badlands. Ironically, the coords, when placed in the Searing Gorge, appear to fit the decriptions made by everyone here. Its an unattainable position in the eastern mountains (so sad some ppl tried hrs to get to it). After I discovered the location discrepency I immediately knew why half the ppl were having problems....

Sha'ni is on top of Dreadmaul. Approx loc is 80,45 if your using cosmos. If your not, then there is a stone alter she is stood infront of opposite a cave.

She is a ghost and you need to 'summon' her by using the remains on the alter.

I have done this quest at least twice and found him in different caves. The second time I did the quest he was exactly where EvilGrinUK described, but someone killed him before I did. I waited for him to respawn, hoping he would respawn in the same spot, but he did not. He respawned in the same cave, but in a different location ... way in the back.

OK here are the exact steps to get the Sprite Darter since many people seem to be confused on how to actually get it. Just remember you need to be level 38 to qualify for this quest.

1. Go to find Kindal Moonweaver, who gives you a quest called Freedom for all Creatures. She is not easy to locate. Her coordinates are 65,46, and to reach her, you need to walk up a ramp up against a cliff hidden behind a tree behind the Tauren village. Follow the ramp up, and you will see her and another NPC called Jer�Kai Moonweaver overlooking the Tauren village.

2. After the Freedom for all Creatures quest, talk to Jer�Kai. She gives you a quest called Doing Justice. After that quest, she sends you to Darnassaus.

3. After getting your reward at Darnassaus, go back to the Tauren village and talk to Jer�Kai again. She gives you a quest to bring an egg to Quentin at Thousand Needles.

4. Keep doing the link of quests after, and you will eventually get the Sprite Darter pet! | Originally posted by Sakura

At level 49 I got 4200 XP for this. My reputation with Darnassus also increased, as did my reputation with Wildhammer Clan.

Edited, Thu Mar 3 08:38:15 2005 | Subject: ""in you fail....""
In case you fail as I did due to disconnection....  The time will run out while you are offline.
Simply abandon the quest and go back to the shimmering flats.  The quest will be available again to you and the timer starts over. 
You do not need more potions.
You do not lose your egg when you abandon the quest

Also, the fastest way to get there is:
1. Ride Back to Gadget
2. Fly to Theramore
3. Take the boat to Menethil,
4. Fly to Aerie Peak

The Dwarf you need to speak to is in the lowest part of the Aerie peak keep.  Go through the door where the mailbox is.  that is the correct building.

Enjoy your little dragon! | Subject: ""Accoring to someone I asked...""
You need to complete the ""Freedom for all creatures"" series first, then return to those NPCs.  The downside is that the last part of this series takes you to Darnassus to see Tyrande and she doesn't really indicate that you can now go back there and get a new set of quests :("

Guys coordinates are fine for people who have the mod but don't put down people who prefer not to use it.  It's their choice.  Someone merely said it'd be nice if real directions were given and you jumped down their throats.  Sure the mod is nice but you can't force people to use it anymore than people can force you to give simple text directions.

If you'd rather not take time to help people regardless of whether or not they're using YOUR favorite mod, then kindly don't say anything instead of turning this discussion into a flamewar.

One thing that text directions will do is navigate you around hazzards such as enemy towns, mountains, cliffs, etc. that a simple beeline to the coordinate will not necessarily do.

I don't have a coordinate mod yet, but when I get one I sure won't begrudge people who don't have one and asked NICELY for simple directions, which I will provide once I complete this quest. | Subject: ""Loc""

The mine is far up in the NE corner of the Barrens and is clearly on the Map. The fastest way to here is to take the back exit from Orgrimmer. Running from Org only takes about 3 minutes. So South after you cross the bridge out of Org. You should see the mine on your map. Bear right around the mountain and you will come across the road. Follow the road up the hill. The mine is at the top.

You need to collect 5 missing pages from the manual first. You do this by killing mob around the mine.

Once you have the missing 5 pages, proceed to the mine, which is to the left of the tower. Copperplug is deep in the mine. Just keep going till you find him. I soloed this as a lvl 24 Rogue. If you are careful, you should be able to solo it level 22-24 without a problem. Level 20, you might want some help.

Once you have recovered the Manual, open your bags and right-click on the missing 5 pages, which will reconstruct the full manual. Now you can Hearth out and turn in the quest. If you plan on fighting your way out, be aware that most of the mob will have respawned. It is almost faster to just Hearth out and wait for your 1 hour cooldown than to try and fight your way out of this place.

Happy hunting. | Subject: ""FYI""
So I didn't anything mentioned where you turn the quest in...so I walked around Org until I found him...just to help you out, he is in The Valley of Honor in Orn...76,25...Hope that helps.. | For those playing hardcore, don't try this mission until you are 5-6 levels up. Unfortunately for the samoplhlage cover you have to kill a boss in the mine and the mine is really full of enemies. At level 21 I risked too much.

Stay safe!"

Really guys, this quest shouldn't take you more than 15mins, depending on how fast you can kill.  There should be no searching and hunting for either one of these creatures at multiple locations.

Zone into ""Felwood"" -- And open up your map.

Look to the north and you will see ""Irontree"", which you'll see a crater like indentation.  Above it you will see Felpaw woods.

Above the Crater, where it says Irontree.. on themap.. there is a semi circle.. a decently large area.  Start on the left hand side of that and follow that semi circle all the way around, and you will never run out of your mob type.  If you get done with bears and need wolves, keep on going around.

This is a ""locless"" description.

Just above the crater, the land level above it, between the road and the crater... Follow that area around to your right.  You shouldn't have to turn around to finish.

Many more than a dozen of each mob before you finish.

Good luck,.. | For those who like coords, they are around 56,23. | Subject: ""Reward""

73,56 | Subject: ""My definitive walkthrough of the quest""
Calling this one of the worst quests in WoW will be an understatement. This is THE worst quest I encountered in my first 45 levels of playing. The description of the quest is vague and this thottbot page contains a lot of misleading information although there are also correct pointers. So here it goes as recent as May 2006.

Before I begin, I really need to vent last night frustration. I spent a grand total of one whole hour searching for this stupid ""evidence"". Considering the xp rewarded, that is like 2800 xp for an hour play. Pretty pathetic. I read somewhere that this quest chain leads to a nice dagger reward, well I really hope that's the case.

Before I jump into details, let me clarify some misleading information mentioned above. I actually do not consider them errors because game settings might be readjusted from several months ago. And I don't think it's a spawn randomly at any Gnoll camps because even after I click on the thing, it didn't disappear so I assume anyone with the quest can still click on it.

misleading info #1: ""it's a bag."" Let me clarify. No, it does not look like a bag. You can argue it looks like a sack. Or I simply refer it as a medium-size-tree-trunk-looking kinda thing.

misleading info #2: ""it is hanging from a tree."" No, it does not hang from a tree at least not in my case. It's more like the sack thing is leaning against the side of tree. If you are looking for a bag hanging from a branch of those small trees, it's not. The sack is at the side of one of those huge trees.

misleading info #3: ""The camp with bag is at the trees where lights shatter through."" This piece of info is the very reason I spent helpless 30 min circling those trees with lights coming through. NO, the camp is NOT there. Gnoll camps that are set up near trees where lights shatter are southeast of that lake. The real camp is straight south of the lake. 

misleading info #4: ""The camp is on a plateau against a tree."" This piece of info is actually correct, but if you notice, ALL camps are on a plateau somewhat near a tree. So this info alone is not sufficient.

misleading info #5: ""The camp has a distinct feature that is it has a cage."" Again, 50% of gnoll camps have one or 2 cages.

Now, the correct steps:

1. Like most of comments above mentioned, get yourself positioned at the ""finger tip"" of the lake. The lake looks a like a hand with a finger sticking out, so get yourself at the finger tip of the hand.

2. Now, face direct south. Not southeast, but straight south.

3. Now, walk straight south. The trees with lights shatter through should be on your distant left-hand side. Now you should be able to walk to the bottom of a huge tree. On your right-hand side there is a gnoll camp against this huge tree.

4. If you climb up the plateau, the sack thing is next to the first gnoll you will encountered. This first gnoll can be killed without aggro additional gnolls. So you can kill him and click on the quest thing.

Two excellent pictures are posted by HuntehKy several months ago. Now, I'll re-post the picture links.

The quest is an instant click so you can literally click on it and run. But the mobs near it can be single pulled and killed, so I see no reason why you want to use ""hit and run"" strategy.

Hope this helps! | It's at 73,56 - But don't be thrown off by the tree nearby with all the shafts of light coming out of it. | Subject: ""OMG! PICTURES!""

First of all, thanks for all the helpful directions.  Figured I'd add some pictures to help show where I found this:

What a mess, so little help given over so many posts.

Completing this quest is very simple and you can solo this quest easily.:

Go to the Writhing Deep (roughly 75,60, SW of Camp Mojache).

Enter the most South Western cave (thanks to a previous poster), this cave has two tunnels which lead to to main chambers the whole cave is pretty small. The mobs are no challenge for the level of quest and you can solo them all.

The coccoon is at 73,61, in the centre of the round chamber, click on it to open (you will see an attacking animation). They guy will come out and will tell you he will stealth his way back. Congrats you've done it.

Darkheart | Subject: ""location""
here it is, plain and simple:

when you jump down on the bottom level of the cave, face the way my character is facing on the minimap.

head toward the side i have circled. you can't miss it! | Subject: ""Experience/Reputation""
3050 XP and an ""increase"" in Darnassus reputation at level 47. This leads to another quest, ""Escaping the Hive"". That's the quest where you escort the NPC from the insect hive - for me, like for many others, it was broken - no NPC appeared.

i just did it, at first i couldn't find it. but the entrance is at location 73,63. drop to the bottom and go into the southwest entrance then turn right at the branch. easy easy, solo'd it. | Subject: ""level 45 hunter solo'ed""
The hive is at 74,62 according to cosmo's. You spiral down into the hive and enter the very first entrance you come to. The one at the top of the spiral. When your inside you will be at a Y turn right. Follow the path down till you come to another Y turn left the pod will be just ahead. Beware there is a tunneler and a stinger there. you will need to kill these ones then in the area with the pod are 3 level 45 tunnelers. I found it easier to pull these one a time. I did this as a level 45 hunter solo it was hard but not impossible. | Subject: ""Confirmation""
Entrance to the Writhing Deep:
73,63
It is a big bug-base with a spiraling path.

Take the spiral path all the way to the VERY bottom.  At the bottom there are two caves, one on the northeast, the other on the southwest.

Enter via the Southwest Cave.

A short distance ahead the tunnel forks.

Go RIGHT.

It's the big squishy thing in the center of the room.  Kill the bugs, free the elf, he'll vanish, then Heartstone out. | Subject: ""The quest is NOT bugged""
The quest is NOT bugged.

A GM said, and I quote, that the quest is NOT bugged, but that it is just very intuitivly unclear.  Very poorly explained.  As such, he was unable to clear alot about it.  However, by trying this quest for over 4 hours.  Reading all kinds of reports on it, I am very, very likly to assume this.

The cocoon is either where it's supposed to be, or it's not.  That is, 73,63, I believe.  I have not seen the location for myself, but anyone who's completed it says that 73,63 is where the cocoon will be.  However, the quest is some kind of escort quest (also mentioned in the forums about it). 

This escort quest can only be done by ONE person on the ENTIRE server at ANY time.  This is directly from the text of the GM.  These would corroborate why, when the server is just reset, that it has worked for some people. 

For instance on Bloodscalp, some newb has left the quest open for 2 days+ now.  So I just bought a 3g bag, and ground the exp.

Good luck if they ever fix it.

P.S.

""They are working dilligently to express the wording of the quest in a better language so it appears clearer, and is able to be completed more often.""

I think the bloodpetal zapper is just be another allusion towards Nintendo's stuff--The Zapper. There are several Legend of Zelda references there and this quest line is all about Mario and Luigi if you're somehow still unaware."

Got 20 samples and as I returned to UC to check them I barely got the 5 items needed... Had no spare samples afterwards.
Based on my experience I'd recommend to get at least 30.

Btw... the duplicate item message appears because you haven't ""opened"" the analyzed sample. A sample from the slimes turns into an analyzed sample. Then you open the analized sample and check if the needed quest item is in there. | Subject: ""Silly WoW""

There is no bug, gravedanger has just ridden too many short buses.  I just completed both of these and ran into no problems.

While the Un'Goro samples took more than the Felwood, it also seems to be the luck of the draw based on other's experiences.

The worst I got with the Felwood samples was 1:6.  The worst for the Un'Goro was 1:10.  I ended out using I think 15 for the Felwood samples.

Use this info as you will.  Better to have more samples than necessary so you don't have to make the trip back.

Lastly, there are some nice items yielded from those samples (superior healing pots for example), so don't turn the quest in until you've tested all the samples.  After you turn the quest in, the bowls on the table become unusable. | Normally takes about ten samples to get all the quest samples you need, but I'd get fifteen anyway just to be on the safe side. If you want to be extra careful, go with twenty. You won't need any more than that unless you have extremely bad luck. | Subject: ""coords""

4294,... and a Batch of Ooze,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4294,"Subject: ""test all""
Just a hint:

test all your samples before ending the quest.
E.g. imagine you have 20 samples and after testing 15 of them you have your 5 questitems. If you now end the quest you cannot test the remaining 5 samples because the testset is inactive.
So you have to drop the remaining samples.
But if you test all you may get some items which can be sold. | All the oozes and slimes I encountered had 100% drop rate for the samples. I gathered 20, just to be on the safe side, and had more than enough.

Back in UC, there are two testing bowls on the table. Use the green one for the Un'Goro samples, and the red one for the Felwood samples. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
Took me 20 samples to get 5 pure ones. I'd get 20-30 to be safe. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
I've got both the Felwood and Un'goro quests.  It's not bugged.  One bowl at the chemist's table in UC is for Felwood and the other is for Un'Goro.  I didn't have to bank anything.

You'll need 50 for the Un'goro quest to be safe.  You'll probably not use this many, but if you have this many it'll save you the trip back.  The worst I got was 1:10.

----- UPDATE -----
I ended out needing 32 samples to complete this quest.  Use that info as you will."

Silvermane stalker is the highest level of silvermane encountered in hinterlands. The ones I fought are all lv48. And they can stealth, which is just pain in the butt. If you start out of AP, the alliance town, you'll travel east. Along the way you'll encounter 2 types of silvermane, mangy silvermane (lv40-41) and silvermane something (lv43-44). You will have to continue to the east. The best way to spot a silvermane stalker is simply to walk in the woods, hope to walk in front of one and spot him before he sees you. | Subject: ""Corrected Instructions: All you need to know""

4421,The Corruption of the Jadefire,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4421,"Subject: ""Location""
It may well be quicker to ride for the griffin flight point through Ashenvale and backup the south end of Felwood. 

Xavathras is located near the Ruins of Constellas.  The confusing part is these 'Jadefire' demons are not located at Jadefire run ... They are just south of Jaedenar. 

Xavathras is located at the end, near a corrupt moonwell (green moonwell).  He respawns fairly quickly.  You can get most of your other kills along the way and then finish off the kills on the way out.  It also looks like you can jump to the south end of Darkshore.

This quest would be pretty fun for a pair of L50s ... or a single 58+ for best speed and low risk.  As a vetran 60 (all L50+ blue gear and more) its pretty easy, but still kind of fun.  Five of these things brough me down to around 700 health ... no buffs, no pots, just my armor and weapons.

They also do a fair bit of shadow damage, so shadow resistance is helpfull, but I've gone mostly for tanking gear (low shadow res).

Xavathras respawns in about 10 to 15 minutes (maybe less).  Looks like he is always at the same spot. | You can find the felsworn in several locs - 39, 82 and north.
Only the felsworn are in this area, you need to travel north to find the rogues and shadowstalkers.

The rogues and shadowstalkers are at the camp at 37,69.

Xavathras is at 32,67 | Everything you need to kill is located at:
37,69 (Ruins of Constellas)

Xavathras is located at the back of the ruins, (32,67) with 1 rogue beside him, and others scattered around.

If you're a lock, Banish rogue, ff dots on Xavathras, let pet get aggro.. etc etc. :) Easy.

P.S If you want felcloth, THIS is the right place to be! | Subject: ""Re: The Corruption of the Jadefire [4421]""
Thank goodness now a flightpath at Emerald Sanctuary - makes life much easier | Subject: ""Xavathras""
Entrance to ravine leading to Xavathras is at 35,67.  Ravine is full of Rogues(lvl 50) and Shadowstalkers(lvl 51 and 52).
Clearing with Xavathras is like the ravine but with level 50 and 51 Felsworn.  Best to work to the right and clear around the edge to the cliff.  Adds are on the ridge to the left.  You will have to fight Xavathras (lvl 54) and another level 51 demon at the same time.
Xavathras stands at 32,67 in front of the hut behind the well. | Subject: ""ooooooooook...""
The Jadefire satyrs, are in the ruins of Constellas, just off the road to the west, near some slimes (right before Jadenar). when you get there the camp will be litterd with the Jadefire. all of the satyrs you need to kill are there.

To get to the boss (i forget his name, and cant look it up cause my wow just crashed :( ...) you have to take a kind of narrow mountain path, if your facing the camp from the front (your back to the slimes) veer off to the right of the camp, when you get to the middle of that section, turn left. you should see a little narrow mountain path. there will be (i bealive) a felsworn, and two rogues in the middle of the path, and then another one right before the camp that has the boss. (hes off to the left a little bit, by another felsworn).

this guy is just 54, nothin speacial about him, he gets enraged right before you kill him, so lowbie casters watch out ;). he was standing near 31:66 i bealive.

this quest is easily soloable.

just dont let your wow crash when you thanking me ;)"

This was opened to me by completing Flute of Xavaric

I hadn't finished the related Corruption of the Jadefire and More Corruption quests, so not sure if that set leads here w/o the flute. | Subject: ""Escorting the Ancient Ghost""
After having succesfully taken the filled Vial back to the Emerald Sancutary in Felwood, I have been told to visit the Ruins right south of Irontree Woods. As soon as I reached them (pretty easy to find, just search around), I used the flute and some ancient tree ghost spawned together with sum minions.

Arei, that is what he is called, wanted me to escort him to the border to Ashenvale.

On our way back to road we had many adds, 52-54 Tree Elementals, and also sum nasty lvl 54 elementals, which looked like green water elementals and had sum nasty, stacking dots.

After we had passed the Bloodvenom Falls, there suddenly spawned 8 (eight!) Jaedenar satyrs lvl 56-58, mostly spellcasters, and 5 of them instantly aggroed me, while that stupid tree ghost hit one satyr, totally ignoring, that the rest was beating the crap out of me.

Conclusion: This Q is definately not soloable as a lvl 55 Human Warlock. Rather doubt it, that a pally or shaman or whatever class could solo it anyway.

Will try it again as soon as I got some plated backup."

There is a statue of a guy with a sword at the ruins.  You need to use the quest item at this statue and it will summon the giant tree man.  The quest he gives is an escort one, and its level 56. | Subject: ""Experience/Reputation""
At level 55, this got me 5450 XP and no reputation adjustment. | Subject: ""Completed successfully""
First off, I tried to do this quest unsuccessfully three times before completing it successfully, and each time I only had to use the flute once.  After using the flute, you'll see some wandering spirits appear and Arei pops up a little ways away near an archway.  He's really big, you can't miss him.

First thing he does after you start the quest is go all over irontree woods agroing everything.  I was able to complete this part because the most he agroed at one time was three.

The biggest hurdle is as he's walking down the path just south of Jaedenhar.  You'll get jumped by 5-6 of those satyr demon thingies.  It will include one Hellcaster who will AOE you to death.  This will take at least two people to deal with those mobs.  I died three times there. 

The last time, I had enough folks helping me to handle them, but as soon as they popped, they agroed ME instead of Arei, and he just kept on lumbering down the path.  So I ignored them.  they chased for a while then turned around.  Turns out the hardest part of the quest turned into a moot point. 

At the border with Ashenvale, you'll get two jadefire demons that spawn, those can be taken out without any problem with one person.

good luck!"

The leg shafts drop from Glassweb Spiders in Searing Gorge. The Overdue Package is in Dustwallow Marsh, and the sword is by the eastern coast of Swamp of Sorrows, carried by a named murloc. Check the links in the quest description above for exact positions. | Subject: ""Quest Objects and Where to Get Them""
These items listed below are the items required for the quest Ledger from Tanaris.

1. Krinkle Goodsteel's Ledger
  -Appears by outhouse after accepting this quest
2. Crystal Leg Shafts
  -Dropped from Glassweb spiders in Searing Gorge (these spiders can be found directly North and West of where you accapt this quest)
3. Goodsteel's Balanced Flamberge
  -Dropped from Jarquia(?) in Swamp of Sorrows  (spawns near the mmiddle of the beach on the  Eastern edge of SoS)
4. An Overdue Package
  -By far the hardest item to find. Found in Dustwallow Marsh by a crashed Zeppelin (Beezil's Wreck). The easiest way to find this is to go to the mountains surrounding Dustwallow Bay (not the mountains surrounding the entire region), then to head south until it says that you've discovered Beezil's Wreck (if you've got your minimap open and zoomed all the way out, it'll look like a tiny black line on the ground when you get close enough). It's a tiny package on the ground, so just search around, it'll be there.

I hope these directions help those who are having trouble completing this quest, and those who are too lazy to figure these things out on their own. | Subject: ""coordinates""
Overdue package - 54,55 (dustwallow)

Godsteel ledger - 66,62 (Searing Sorge)

Leg shafts - spiders drop them (Searing Sorge)

Goodsteel Ledger
_________________________________________

page 1

Greetings and Salutations.
Adventurers!

I, Krinkle Goodsteel, have need of
Those willing to put themselves at
risk in order to complete some of my
most arduous tasks. Because of my
many duties and the workload I've
managed to take upon myself, I ensure
that anyone brave enough to complete
this list of items and return them to me
intact will be paid handsomely.

The list is contained on the following
pages...
___________________________________________

page 2

Solid Crystal Leg Shafts -

The Glassweb spiders of Searing Gorge
are made of an incredible
crystal-like material. Their legs, if not
damaged when they're killed, make for
a wonderful conductor in some of my
companions' engineering experiments.

I will need a number of them to test
upon. The spiders having eight possible
legs themselves should be no problem
for a stalwart warrior or practiced
mage.
__________________________________________

An Overdue Package -

I hired someone who I thought was a
reliable pilot to bring me a package
from Theramore. I was apparently
wrong. And even though the pilot
lived to tell the tale, he left his entire
zepplin and all it's cargo behind to
save his own neck.

Well, I need that package back. From
what Beezil tells me, he crashed just
west of the bay in Dustwallow
Marsh. It went down just after he
crossed the hills along the water's
edge.

Hmmm... never did tell me what caused
him to crash...

Goodsteel's Balanced Flameberge -

Finally, I want one of my finest
works of blacksmithing to date. This
flameberge was an incredible sword
that I bestowed upon what I thought
was a very honorable and great
warrior. Well, he was tronced by a
murloc named Jarquai? Something like
that.

It was while he was traveling along
the coast of the Swamp of Sorrows
when he thought to attack the
creature. He failed and aperantly
fled, but not before leaving the
weapon behind for this murloc to
take.

Find me these items and return to
gadgetzan with them all, along with
this ledger, and I will reward you.

_____________________________________________

Additional note:

To aquire the ledger be sure to look at the ground next to the outhouse as it is slid under the door and you need to click on it to pick it up, he does not actually hand it to you.

Edited, Wed Jan 19 13:40:43 2005 | Subject: ""The ledger""
When you accept the quest the ledger appears on the ground by the outhouse. If its not there, just talk to him again and he'll drop it on the ground. I thought I never recieved it either, but you you have to actively pick it up. | So....for WoW Classic... To make it easier for those looking for old posts about it:

The ledger appears in front of the outhouse for you to click on the ground. If it disappears, click the outhouse again and ask to borrow it. It will appear again. | So you don't have too scroll down to far, in Swamp of Sorrows you are looking for a named murloc on the back called Jarquia, who drops the flaberge. Questie's icon puts him in a turtle shell hut thing at 94.50 or so, but he is often elsewhere. Check at 91.66 first as this is where I and many others below found him in the open. Level 46, easy kill.

To be a bit more accurate since there are three types of spiders in Searing Gorge. The ones that you are looking to kill for the shafts are Glassweb Spiders. One place to find them is around Sea of Cinders/Grimslot Dig Site/Tanner's Camp. | Subject: ""Confirming Coords for Package and the Flanberge Sword""
I just completed this quest and my coords are as follows:

The Overdue Package (Dustwallow) = 53,55
  Path to get there = 55,50

Goodsteel's Balance Flanberge (sword dropped from Jarquia the murloc in Swamp of Sorrows) = 93,51
(he is a blue colored murloc standing next to a large turtle shell)

I did this easily as a 49 druid in cat form. there are spiders and slimes there (40-41)in the area of the wreck.

Happy hunting!
Shandor | The sword ""Goodsteel's Balanced Flameberge"" drops off of the named murloc right outside of the turtle house at 94, 52 in swamp of sorrows | Subject: ""Info and Coords""
The dwarf in the outhouse will put the ledger on the ground. If you miss it you can request it again. Strange thing is even if you let him out and watch him head off and disappear his voice will still come from the outhouse when clicked.

Solid Crystal Leg Shafts are found on Glassweb spiders found throughout Searing Gorge.

The overdue package is found at the crashsite in Dustwallow Marsh west of Theramore at coords 54,55

And lastly the Balanced Flameberge is found on a named level 46 Murloc called Jarquai in Swamp of Sorrows. He is found along the eastern beach at coords 91,66

Now take the items to Goodsteel in Gadgetzan, Tanaris for your reward. | Subject: ""Crits don't matter""
Just to be perfectly clear, I did this quest on March 5 2007 and kept a clear eye on my combat text and I got a number of the spider leg drops on fights where I critted multiple times.

Crits do NOT affect drop rate.

It is just that the drop rate sucks."

At first I went to the first location provided and no drops.
Then I went to another one and nothing at all.
I decided to go South and killed two creepers and got 2/2 for the drop.

The location I was at was 47,33.

My drop rate was:
Tar Beast 13%
Tar Creeper 11%

I got more from the Creepers then Beast though.

FORGET ALL THAT Shi...!above and listen start at Fp marster in felwood take the road SOUTH and go to41- 68 and enter there then go to
36- 67you will see a small path there you will find some mobs called jadefire. they are the guards of the well its only, lvl 51 - 52and there is a ""boss"" lvl 54No Big deal........

easy whit lvl 52 Paladin
Good luck
aKa Slimeball...! | The corrupted moonwell is at (32,66) Felwood, surrounded by level 50-52 Jadefire satyrs and a named boss, Xavathras (54). | Also note, to get here, you need to come from the south, not the north. If you're coming from Bloodvenom post, you want to get off the road somewhere aroun 42,66. Coming from the north will only get you lost in the mountains surrounded by angry orcs. | Subject: ""Wrong Quest""
Most of the comments posted on this page are about the wrong quest.The well you want the sample is NOT in Jaedenar.That well is for the quest ""Collection of the Corrupt Water"".The well for this quest,""Well Of Corruption"",is in THE RUINS OF CONSTELLAS.Just follow the path all the way to the back and you will see it.So people please make sure that the quest you are commenting on is the right one and quit comfussing the hell out of people. | Follow up Quest:

Corrupted Sabers
https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4506"
4506,Corrupted Sabers,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4506,"After returning to Winna Hazzard with the corrupted cat, you must talk to the pet to continue the quest. Until you do this, Winna will have a gray question mark above her head.

Also, be quick about talking to the cat. Once you are close enough to Winna Hazzard, the cat stops and no longer follows you. The cat will despawn quickly so be sure to talk to it quickly otherwise you'll be doing the whole thing over again. | Subject: ""RIGHT CLICK ON CAT AS SOON AS YOU RETURN!!!""
Title says it all.  Seems someone did bury this comment on the page afterall; but I did the quest without knowing this and wondered why I couldn't turn it in.  Had to go back, and discover the hard way.

Do yourself a favor, and right click cat first.  I did everything possible to try to make this stand out from the page for people looking for coords or whatever, so they won't have to go back. | FYI: As a rogue, you can stealth back out with the cat. It doesn't seem to pull aggro. | Subject: ""talk with cat""
Then you get corrupted cat(Moonwell is on 31:66), bring it to Winna(34:52). Then you get there talk with cat. | Subject: ""Easy for anyone""
Fight your way in and open the carrier, the cat turns into a large green cat that is very fast.  Just mount up and ride back to the road, as long as you don't get knocked off your mount by running right over a Jadefire, you are home free.  The cat follows you, unlike other escort quests, so just haul and get to the road and that's it!

Did this as a 52 Hunter.  Some mobs will respawn behind you, but as I say, just run around them and continue to the road. | Subject: ""Turning in the Quest!""
Some of the previous posters indicated these symptoms as well, but here goes:

Your cat will no longer follow you once you get into Bloodvenom.  It goes and sits next to Winna.  And you will NOT see the gold dot on your mini map.  You have to go to the cat, right-click, and ""release"" the cat before the gold question mark will appear above Winna.

As a previous poster indicated, you don't seem to have much time once the cat leaves your side.  Someone I did the quest with was running around when we returned it and the cat disappeared from Winna's side before he realized what was going on, and he had to abandon and start over. | 1) Winna Hazzard gives you a usable cage (Winna's Kitten Carrier).
2) You go to a moonwell at 32.66 (path starts around 37.68).
3) In the moonwell, you use the cage and a cat spawns. This cat will follow you as a pet.
4) You lead the cat back to Winna.
5) When you get back to Winna, the cat stops, and you have to TALK TO THE CAT.
5) Now you can complete the quest by talking to Winna.
6) Profit. | Subject: ""Appears to be bugged in 1.4""
Edit: The first time, it didn't let me ""talk"" with the cat at first so I wound up wandering too far away and it despawned. Second time I noticed it was letting me ""talk"" with the cat, and was able to complete the quest.

Back to topic: The quest is quite easy. You get the quest from Brave Moonhorn south of the Southern Barrens (the north part of Thousand Needles), and then all you have to do is to take the lift down and follow the way. It'll lead you to a ""crossroad"" where Freewind Post is marked!

4581,Kayneth Stillwind,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4581,"Subject: ""Forest Song location""
Forest Song (where you will find Kayneth) is Northeast of Satyrnaar. Not very far at all. It will tell you you're in Forest Song. | Subject: ""coords""
loc 85,45 | Subject: ""<Blank>""
There's horde rogues stealthing by the roads if you try and pass by the horde settlement, there's also a mounted guard patrolling between the settlement and the labor camp. I found another route, through the wilderness that avoids all the 30+ stuff that is in that area.

At the river go north along the west bank. Some spiders and bears here that you can avoid fairly easily. Just south of the lake a little ways cross the river, if you are unlucky you will run into an elemental but odds are you won't. Go east and down into the wedge shaped valley and directly east, a few nasty wolves here but if you are careful you should only have to fight one or two. You will come back out to the road and as long as you keep to the right side should avoid getting the attention of any of the demons in Satyrna. There's also an alliance graveyard on the right if you are unlucky to die around here or need to hide from the patrolling horde rider. Follow the road a little ways and the entrance to Forest Song is by the road on your left. | Subject: ""More to this one""
There is a followup quest to this called ""Insane Druids"" - not much additional info at this time. | Subject: ""coords""
Anyone who doesn't have cosmos can put

/script px,py=GetPlayerMapPosition(""player"")
/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(format(""[ %s ] %s , %s"",GetZoneText(),(px*100),(py*100)));

in a macro box to make a macro out of it. Drag whatever icon you chose to an action bar, and just hit it whenever you need to know what the coords are where you're standing. It works great and you don't have to go download some huge add-on. =) | The coords of this q are 85.44"

Both this part and the last part of the quest are easy, all you have to do is freeze the egg get close (not too close) and use the other item.

if your raid doesn't want to bother with your quest while they're in the rookery, just wait until you've killed General Drakkisath and finished the run.  from there you can jump straight down to the rookery, and as long as you don't pop any whelps, you should be able to finish the quest solo. | The eggs required for this quest are in the Rookery in Upper Blackrock Spire (UBRS). Simply freeze the eggs and slowly approach them and use the device provided by the quest to capture them. Getting to the eggs, however, does in fact require a raid. If your raid does not want to do your quest, just wait until they finish up and head back down to the Rookery and complete it yourself."

There are two waterfalls in this river.  One that is next to the ocean and another that is farther inland.  You want to go to the waterfall that is near the ocean to get the sample of water. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
By ""mouth"" they mean the part of the river that opens to the sea.

Fill sampling tube by actually swimming into the waterfall (below the bridge).

Do NOT confuse this quest with the quest ""The Principal Source"" (Druid quest). THAT sampler must be filled not at the Seaside, but at the landside part of the river, near the hills mountains.

Fill point for Sampling Tube, Cliffspring River:
Waterfall at 50,25.

Fill point for Druid quest: [ https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4497 ] : 55,33 . | Subject: ""NA""
50,25 | Subject: ""confused about waterfalls?""
Everyone seems to get the waterfalls confused. Follow the path to the Cliffspring River, and jump off the bridge you pass over. That's the waterfall you want, not the one near the Furbolg camp. | Subject: ""Experience/Reputation""
At level 15, I got 800 XP for this, plus an increase in my reputation with Darnassus. | Head north from Auberdine along the road until you come to the bridge at the Cliffspring River at 50,24. Jump off the bridge towards the east and you should land right before the waterfall. Swim up to it and click on your vial. | This quest is not near the cave with the Stormscale Wave Riders but at the waterfall near the sea. | Subject: ""If you can't fill it ...""
I've checked my quest, it's ""The Cliffspring River"" allright, I'm at the bottom of the first waterfall from the coast, and I see the bridge overhead just as it sais in the quest.

I've swum around a bit, tried different locations near the waterfall and pool, but it keeps saying ""Requires Cliffspring Falls Cave Mouth"" ...

then I started thinking, and noticed I had TWO vials in my bags :D

Be sure to use the right one for this quest (the little small black one, not the blue one).

Also, you need to actually swim in the stream of the waterfall to fill it.

Happy hunting"

Grain=50,33

Nuts=51,34

Pretty easy quest...so far..i still have to kill the actual guy but it cant be that hard :p im writing this as i go. | To complete the quest you need to collect three ingredients from barrels at furbolg camps. But first, fill  Empty Cleansing Bowl from Auberdine well.
All the camps are located east of Bashal'aran and filled with mobs, so be carefull. Also opening the barrels may trigger furbolg respawn so mind it.
After collecting three ingredients find a big bonfire and use bowl to spawn Xabraxxis. Kill him and open Xabraxxis' Demon Bag it's just dropped on the ground.

 The Blackwood Corrupted - www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0skyfDp_tQ | Subject: ""Annoying""
This is an irritating quest if you lose. When I got back to my corpse he was still there (and it was a little buggy, some of the furbolgs were shifting between green and red), so I sat and rebuffed, and right when I was about to pull him, he disappeared.

You lose the bowl when you use it, so you have to abandon the quest and get it again to get the bowl again to resummon. Pretty annoying. | The items can be found:
Grain: 50, 35
Fruit: 52, 33
Nuts: 51, 33

Once you have all of the items, right-click on the cleansing bowl and you'll see ALL of the Furbies run at you, but don't worry they won't attack you. I solo'd this as a 17 druid. | Subject: ""Xabraxxis""
What you're looking for is in the containers that look like large, over-turned barrels or drums. Once you've collected all three, you have to ""use"" the items beside the bonfire in the center of the camp. You can't do this while in combat, but once you DO, don't worry about the furbolgs, as they'll become pacified and not attack you (at least for a while). After about five seconds, Xabraxxis will appear and begin attacking you. Kill him and take the talisman you loot from his ""demon bag"" back to Thundris. | Subject: ""Completed as Level 15 Hunter - Solo""
It's a fairly hard quest, I died twice doing it. Most of the time it was because I was pulling and then was attacked by 3 or 4 of the level 14 Bears.

Just pull all the ones near the materials away. gather those, then pull and kill as many in the camp as you can, run in, right click the bowl and then run.

Wait until all the things swarm the bowl, then a red devil looking guy shows up (level 19) yelling about cleansing camps, pull him, kill him, loot his body.

THE TALISMAN IS IN A CRATE NEXT TO HIS BODY, IT ISN'T ON HIS BODY.

Goodluck,
Unsuspected, Level 15 NE Hunter | Do not panic in Hardcore - a bunch of furbolgs will all arrive when you place the item, but will soon eat the bait and only the quest npc will be hostile to kill. | Subject: ""<Blank>""

This quest-chain is easy and it gives you something that is very expensive and/or annoying to get. REPUTATION with stormwind. I need 20k more reputation with stormwind to become exalted so I can buy a swift horse mount =). Instead of a ugly mechanostrider ^^

And besides u get cash. If the questrewards sucks , sell them."

If you watch his path it is possible to start the quest and get out of his agro range without fighting him. As soon as he flys by the quest NPC start the quest and you should be fine. | The quest starts at 18, 41 up in the Highperch area. Go to the south-eastern ""tower"" on your map and you will find a narrow path going up the back of the canyon wall. Pao'ka is right on the ledge.

It's pretty straightforward. He doesn't have waves of mobs that attack him like other escort quests, but he does wander right into plenty of wyverns on the way. He's fairly strong and can almost take a wyvern by himself, so if you end up pulling 3 at a time, you can kill your two before killing his. As soon as you're out of combat, his health resets.

He is buffable, unlike some other escort mobs."

Is there any follow-up ?

Edit: It looks like, there is no follow-up.

Does it give any kind of reputation ?

Edit: It gives a significant amount of reputation (if I remember right, 200) for Argent Dawn, of course.

If I complete the quest, can I get another Dawn's Gambit (For farming Vectus)?

Edit: If you complete the quest, you can ask for another box, so, Vectus is farmable. | Subject: ""actual chain""

Axe sold for over 5g :)

When our group activated Dawn's Gambit, we did it in a far corner.  The room aggros and if you're in the middle they *all* aggro on you.  If you're in a corner, part of them attack immediately and then you can pull them in batches after that.  The mobs are pretty brittle and drop fast, but they can zerg you and overwhelm if you're not careful. | Subject: ""if doing quest iwth others...""
If you're doing this quest with another in your group, make sure everyone places their gambits. 

It's a quest requirement.  I let a groupmate use his and didn't use mine and now I have to go back... again. | Subject: ""Prev Quests""

This quest is easy...

The moonwell is RIGHT next to the person who gives you this quest. 37,43 if you REALLY need the co-ordinates.

The next bit is so easy that theres no need to even bother using co-ordinates or whatever.
You should KNOW where the damn crystal is cause you just seen it from the previous quest. It's THE SAME CRYSTAL AS BEFORE!:S
48,49 are the co-ords for the crystal.
For those without co-ordinates.. Stand directly under the D in Auberdine, on the map... The crystal is Directly east of that.

The only... remotley ... 'difficult' part is cutting through the moonkin to get to it. Even though.. you've already done it once... If you're new at the game you might have your hands full, but if you can pull mobs away from the crowd then you'll be fine.

I cant see why anyone needs help on this quest...

Fight your way to the crystal, click it to pour the water over it and get the next quest. All that takes is getting back to Auberdine. You need co-ordinates for that too? �.� | Subject: ""How to do""

As a result, if you can't find it in one location, look in one of the others. | This quest is a reference to Aliens. The reason the serpent kills the dog before it jumps is because in the movie (either one of the movies or the game, can't remember which) a newly hatched Alien feeds on dogs (and other such pet animals). | Subject: ""alien egg""

41,41 | COORDINATES: 48, 43

I headed directly north of Freewind Post and found of camp of Galak Scouts, Wranglers and Windchasers. Theyre in a camp along the northern barrier of the map. Wranglers and Windchasers were plentiful while Scouts were a little rarer.

Theyre pretty well spaced out so you can easily move west through the camp slaughtering as you go.

The windchasers have the ability to heal themselves and other centaurs so you may want to focus on these first. They also have a whirlwind spell which will render you immobile so be cautious.

The wrangles have the ability to net you so be wary of that.

I had the best luck finding scouts by looking at the entrances/exits to the camp. Scouts seem to serve as the guards for the camp. | Subject: ""please....""
It's not a super secret coord system.. It's just the % over and down on the zone.

for example:
41, 41 = 41% down from the top of the 1k needles map, and 41% right from the left edge of that map (the map you see when you press M). Yes, it's (X,Y) from middle school.

Also, blizzard provides those coords, the mods just show them visibly. There are tons of mods that do it. Some ones with small footprints imho are titanbar or fubar (google it or search wowinterface.com). Just get a location plugin for one of those mods (plugins are reallys imple, you don't even have to put them in 1 folder, just put the folders that you download into [Insert your harddrive and wow install destination, by default C:/Program Files]/World of Warcraft/Interface/Addons/ folder.

On the surface this can appear quite daunting but theres an easy way round it for the right classes...

To start with she can be found by simply riding the road to south and looking to the left side of the road when you reach the ""owl wing thicket"".

Now she just walks to each cave in turn ignoring the beasts, but, if you let her get attacked first (shock horror!) then she will fight back and you can then take the aggro off her and she'll help you fight the target.  Also you can heal and buff her so dont forget to use this.

Make sure you get her to help as much as you can, it slows her up and makes things easier on you.

Also note her threat area is quite small so stay back and let her lead to ensure you dont pull first.

If you do by accident, dont panic, she's quite tough and can take a good few hits herself before you need to step in.

Soloed at 56 druid without one potion.

good luck. | Subject: ""Stay waaay back""
The other night I (57 mage) did this with a 54 druid friend, but what surprised me was how far back we had to stay from Ranshalla. The first try we followed at maybe 5-10 yards, but every time Ranshalla drew aggro, the wildkin went right through her and aggro'd the druid. It didn't go well, the druid died, and I escaped to the road with only 5% health remaining. While I was healing up, I got the message that the quest had failed, so this one is not like the standard escort quests. Most likely what happened is that Ranshalla went to the next torch and casted her strange spell, but neither of us were there to click on the torch so it did not light. So very likely that's what failed the quest and not too much distance which normally causes escort quests to fail. The next time we tried it we both kept back from Ranshalla at the limit of my casting range and that worked very well - Ranshalla became the tank and we just nuked any wildkin that wanted to fight. Another note - only one party member needs to light the torch for everyone to keep advancing the quest, so if you bring a group, select one to go with Ranshalla, everyone else can just kill the wildkin to keep the area clear. The ending animation for this quest is very cool and something that I wish WoW had more of. FFXI was full of great cutscenes like this and something that I've missed since departing from that game. Maybe BC will bring more of these kinds of animations, but who knows ... | This escort quest ends in a pretty cool lore event concerning the history of the wildkin, check it out.

Priestess of Elune says: Through the gem, Elune channeled her infinite wisdom...

Priestess of Elune says: It was on that day that the wildkin were given to us. Fierce guardians, the goddess assigned the wildkin to protect all of her sacred places.

Priestess of Elune says: Wildkin are inherently magical; this power was bestowed upon them by the goddess.

Finally, after all of this time using thott I can actually post something constructive for future generations.

It's a rather simple escort quest: you go to five caves and light five torches (you must right click the torch to light it) and then to an alter where you get a nice light show followed by the reward detailed above.

Nice and easy.

/Lore of Garona | One tip on completing this quest, let Ranshalla aggro the owlbeasts. She can take a hit or two, and if she isn't the one to aggro them, sometimes she just keeps walking while you're in battle, and can get into trouble by aggroing more of them. | Subject: ""Recommendations""
I reccomend doing this with the Enraged Wildkin quest line (specifically part 3: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4864/enraged-wildkin).  You have to kill the same wilkdin in both.

respawn of arnak ~ 7 minutes | Subject: ""Thalia Amberhide""
I read some of the posts saying the quest was bugged but its not. You have to escort Lakota out of the Village and then she will  disappear. From there, return to Freewind Post and speak with Thalia Amberhide who is inside of the Inn. Everything worked fine for me. Lvl 25 mage. | A few tips for this one

Do this quest at the same time as  Wanted - Arnak Grimtotem. Since Arnak Grimtotem is very close to where you will first start this quest.

You get this quest from the NPC Lakota Windsong
She is found at coordinates 28, 26. To get to that point, come down the great lift. Go straight ahead until you see a totem on your left at approx 31,37. This marks a parth that goes to the top of the grimtotem pinacles. Follow the path along the top and when you get to a pinacle with more than one path, take the left one. This will bring you to a clearing on the northern cliff face where you will find both Lakota Windsong for this quest, as well as Arnak Grimtotem for the  Wanted - Arnak Grimtotem quest.

The enemies along the escort path respawn pretty quick so there's not much benefit to clearing them ahead of time except for the ones closest to where you start. Lakota Windsong, however, has a slow respawn time. So if someone just just done the quest, espect to wait 10 minutes or so for her to respawn.

Her escort will take take the path all the way back to that totem at ground level. This leads you through 3 platforms with enemies. More enemies spawn each time she gets to the middle of a platform. So each time you get to a platform, pull 1 or 2 of the mobs back off the platform. She will help you fight them. Take care of all of them 1 or 2 at a time like that before actually moving on to the platform. Then you won't have to deal with them at the same time as the ones that spawn.

You can buff and heal the NPC while you are escorting her. | The spawn rate here is high, so you'll need to fight your way down even if you cleared the path on the way up. Additional mobs spawn when she reaches each plateau, but you can start pulling the respawned Grimtotems while still on the bridges to avoid fighting them all at once.

Lakota disappears once you get to the bottom of Darkcloud; cash in the quest in Freewind Post to get the reward."

Last edited by Skosiris on 2007/10/14 (Patch 1.12.1) | For those without a coordinate addon, on the road from Camp Taurajo to Crossroads, there's a bridge that crosses a dried up river bed. To the soutwest of that bridge there are a pair of huts or houses. Inside one of those huts is a body, that body is Mankirk's wife. | This quest has probably caused more Barrens related jokes than any other. Hardly a minute can go by without a person asking, ""Where is Mankruks wife lol!?""

The above posters are correct. If you follow the road south you will eventually cross a small bridge. Very near the bridge are a group of small huts. The beaten corpse is inside one of the huts. Make sure to click on the corpse!

  Like many have said before the quest was a pain in the ass due to vauge directions.  I actually had to come to ThotBot to find more on it and piece together the quest with everyones directions. 
  Yes you can either start in ""The Crossroads"" or ""Camp Taurajo"" your choice. Simply put, if you start from ""The CrossRoads"", go South on the Gold Road (The Main Road in the Barrens running North/South). Going South, keep your eye out for a bridge that passes over a dip in the plains, the bridge has 4 big horns/tusks built into it. Mind you coming south from the Xroads, you will be able to see the two white tents Mankrik's Wife is located at before you even cross the bridge. The two tents are located off to the right of the Southern Gold Road.  On closer inspection the  white tents are of Tauren design. One is smaller than the other, and the larger of of which has a air driven wind grain on top. Mankrik's wife is located on the SW side of the tents, a virtual 3 feet out of the entrance of the tent with the air powered grinder on top. She will be the ""Level 16 Beaten Corpse"" laying on the ground. Go up (Right Click) on her and then return to Mankrik in ""The Crossroads"".
  If you choose to start from ""Camp Taurajo"", run North up the ""Southern Gold Road"" The white tents will become visible quite shortly after your departure from ""Camp Taurajo""  This is about as detailed as I want to get. (^_^)  Hope this helps. | Subject: ""<Blank>""

Just inspect the body that is laying inside the tent.

Like the first post saids she is located to the right of the bridge if you are headed south ... FYI she is no longer in the realm of the living .. in other words she is laying on the ground near the Huts | Subject: ""49, 50""
49 50 is correct. all you do is walk to the body and your done | Subject: ""where is she""
Head south on the Gold Road from Crossroads. You will cross a small bridge, she is next to a hut on the west side of the road. | Subject: ""Finding Mankrik's wife""
Follow the Gold Road south out of Crossroads. You will soon cross a small bridge over a ditch, and once crossing south over the bridge you will enter the Southern Gold Road.
Stop just south of the bridge and turn to face West. For the compass-challenged, West is on the left side of the minimap*.
You will see two huts - a short one and a taller one. Head over to them.

If you have co-ordinates, they are as stated in the Additional Notes: 49,50.

Note: If you are lower-level, watch out for the Ornery Plainstriders (which, as oppose to earlier plainstriders, are now aggressive), Sunscale Scytheclaws and Stormsnouts. They are level 17-18. The Zhevra Chargers are still passive, as are any giraffes you might see.

Mankrik's wife - or, at least, her corpse, is here. Yes, she is dead.

Go in front of the mill. That's the taller building. There is an orc female (Mankrik's wife) laying on the ground, named Beaten Corpse. Right-click on it to interact with it. It will say:

---
The body is that of a female orc warrior.

It is clear that she died in battle, probably against the quilboar in the area.
---

Select the option, I inspect the body further. It will say:

---
You turn the body over and see the marks from blades and spells upon the deceased orc--her armor all but destroyed, her hair matted to her face.

Based on Mankrik's description of her, there is no doubt in your mind that this was his wife.

He will be upset by the news, but you are sure he should know the truth.
---

Click Goodbye and head back to Mankrik to break the news.

___

Loot note: There is sometimes a food crate, drink barrel or other form of crate/box inside the mill, against the back wall behind the wheel in the middle.

* If you don't have a minimap for some reason, click the [X] in the top-right hand corner of the screen beside the name of your current zone. NO, that's not an Exit button, and I'm not a prankster. That button is to show/hide your minimap and minimap buttons (though why it's an X instead of something like a _ doesn't occur to me).

Is it that hard? I just completed it at lv38 alone. First I looked around the vicinity for any mob and took out a spider and raptor.

I had VW out to tank the demon, but big blue couldn't hold aggro for more than 30 sec, so I sacrificed him for shield and nuked all out. When the shield drops, it was Fear time. Keep the demon feared and don't stop shadowbolting it; always refresh your DoTs and Fear when they wear off.

The demon hit me for 80-130, but I have 2,100 HP with all +stamina gears, so I could take lots of beatings. In the end I came out with 70% life, almost depleted mana, and about 50 secs left.

just run to the near lake or river, and fight on the cliffs edge, once u killed one and dont think u can handle the second, jump into the water and wait for aggro to go. | But seriously, if you are a level appropriate warrior or rogue, do yoursself a favor and say fck off to this quest. FCK THIS QUEST. As a warrior, even if you use your 30 min cooldown and kill 3 of them, when 1 dies a new one spawns. They constantly apply a slow debuff, so you can't run away, and your attacks take forever. There is no way you complete this quest without dying multiple times. &*!@ like this is ridiculous. I'm at 1.6g repair and only half done. I wish someone had warned me like I'm warning you. NOT WORTH IT.

Just a guess, but don't stand between two silos when you summon. You may end up summoning from both. After you summon, the glow goes away from the silo for awhile.

These are beasts. A hunter can freeze-trap one, put a pet on another and scare yet another, so three are manageable, if you're not surprised by them (as I was). A druid could sleep one.

With the constant re-spawning and the ""slow"" spell, these are long fights. Mana users should wear +Spirit gear, or they may run out of mana from healing the pet/themselves, casting spells, etc. Use whatever crowd control you have for bandages, heals, etc.

Fortunately, they don't hit too hard. | Subject: ""New Coordinates""
Looks like this is one of those things they changed in a patch. New Coordinates are 49,70 and the water trick does still work | Subject: ""easy if you're prepared""
this can be a very simple quest.

get in the water S of the ruins, and go E of the east bridge.

come up near 50,70 (or on the map what looks like just E of the ruins) and kill the 1 or 2 single mobs on the hills.  look for big silos with blue light streaking out of them.  clear out any stray mobs and blow horn.

I've seen the parasites come in mobs of 2 or 3.  back up to the hills to fight them so you don't aggro any of the undead in the area, and use the water as an escape if necessary (or for more room, as there are no mobs in the water).

when you kill the last parasite of the current group- another parasite can immediately spawn in the exact same spot, and this can happen multiple times.  I have seen the parasites heal and do something like a self-banish, where they regain all health, wont attack, but can't be hit for probably 15-20 seconds. 

took me 10-15min solo with a lvl57wrlk | Subject: ""get ready to die, if you are a rogue""
As a 57 rogue I died 4 times trying to complete this quest and you will too. Because you cant stealth. The maggots have you targeted. Also they will follow you a little way into the water.

Step 1. Find the stinking silos. Go back to Chillwind camp. Then go through the Sorrow Hill Graveyard to the bridge taking you into Andorhal(sp). Just before you get on the bridge look to your right. About 1:00 and in the distance you will see two trees and a windmill. Jump into the river and swim straight to the windmill. Climb the bank on the other side and you will find three silos. You will know them by the blue light streaming out of them.

Step 2. Summon the maggots. Open your bag find the thingy and right click. The green maggots will appear. In waves. When you kill one another will appear immediately. You can not stealth or vanish. Just start hacking away as frantically as you can.

Step 3. Killing the maggots. Keep hacking and dying and trying to jump in the water just before you die to escape the relentless attacks of the maggots.  Eventually you will hack your way through 15 and turn in the quest.

This quest might be easy for a warrior or paladin but for a rogue deprived of stealth and a good opener it is a real pain."

Ok this is the quest in plain english, i can't understand why people are having such an issue with it. This is how i did it, with out failing.

Step1: Get initial quest of lock trainer in SW, who sends you to Menara in Ratchet.

Step2: Get the quest of Menara, then the second quest of one of her acolytes.

Step3. Go to Desolace, Kill an infernal, and just before it dies, use the Emerald given to you to capture it's soul. (Like using DrainSoul).

Step4. Go and kill a Summoner at the Coven.

Step5. Go to Dustwallow Marsh and find Tabatha, in a house, in The Quagmire.

Step6: Get a level 60 to meet you at Tabatha.

Step7: Accept final part of Quest of Tabatha.

Step8: Follow Tabatha to garden at side of house, where she summons demon.

Step9: Send in Voidwalker, DoT demon, and shadowbolt it, while Level 60 does the rest.

Step10: With 2 mins to spare, go back in house and speak with Tabatha.

Step11: Go back to Manara in Ratchet and Quest is complete.

I felt the need to write this as some people seem to find it hard/confusing. This should clear that up :)

Also as someone else mentioned choose if you want fire or shadow as your path.

Good Luck :).. and i did this at level 36 | Depending on which quest you selected your rewards will be one of the following:

1) The other half of the charm is on him.. to my knowledge undead really don't have the urge to  steal/pillage personal possessions and hold onto them..

2) Is right outside / on the farm.. and is ""Jabbering"" meaning to talk rapidly, or unintelligibly... his soul isn't at rest either... Mmhm.

A Summary

Closest place to Everlook.
Can be found at 60,33 - walking down the hill towards Everlook.

Full Patrol Path
I have followed him through a full circuit of his patrol path and he walks to the peaks of four different hills. Head to any of these and wait - or plot a path to find him.
The Peaks.
56,38
60,31
61,27
64,24

He is a level 56 Golden Elite.
He looks just like any other white bear.

5800 Exp.

100 to Thunder Bluff Rep.

To pull into town for town guard assistance -
Go out of the Horde entrance heading North - go to the top of the hill - wait to find this Bear and then head South staying ahead of the bear until you find it start to move away from Everlook to the West.

Pull to the Horde side entrance of Everlook (West side) and the guards will net it and finish it off.

To those that find mobs will not pursue them when desired -
You have to inflict *some* damage to successfully pull the bear all the way to the entrance. I would suggest doing it in bursts - keeping ahead of this slow bear in between your attacks.

Solo'd as a level 56 shadow priest 10-0-38.
I pulled to the town because it was mentioned so much in previous posts and i have never done such a thing before. Pretty sure i would of finished it anyway as the bear was very low health as it reached the town and my mana + health were looking good. (Vampiric Embrace is just fantastic).    8) | Subject: ""Letter to Ursisus""
Dear Ursius,

The first time we met, I remember you did your maulish bear hug. I was inclined to fall off a cliff, and die. The second time I died again, falling off these goddamn cliffs. Then I stalked you, you ran away and I followed. In an open clearing you killed me again. The fourth time I caught you dissapearing around the bend of a mountain. You can't escape! You killed me promptly. The fifth time, I was - frankly - pissed off. I let you have it, and with a little luck took you out! May you enjoy bear heaven little Ursius, now gtfo of my game.

Enche, 57 Troll Hunter
<Eternality>
Dalvengyr (U.S.) | This bear wanders around the mountains, so it's hard to give exact coords for him. Look around his page (Click on the Ursius Slain link for Wowhead's listed coords)

Pretty much a basic 56 bear. Mages and warlocks should have no problem soloing. Not sure about other classes, but depending on gear and level, they shouldn't have much problem either.

For those of you without any UI installed, Ursus wanders around the mountains north of Everlook. It may take some hunting to find him, as he wanders around the mountains.

5055,Brumeran of the Chillwind,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5055,"Brumeran is a chimera that wanders around the southern portion of Winterspring.

She wanders around even more then Ursius, so giving exact coords are very hard. Look at her page (Click on the ""Brumeran Slain"" link on this page) for coords. I would, however, recommend waiting and looking around 62.5, 57.9 for her, as you can fight her without risk of adds (It's on or near the road.)

She's a level 58 Chimera with lightning breath and a stackable poison effect. Nature protection would be recommended here. The poison will eat down at your health fairly quickly. I'd recommend bringing a nature protection potion (And/or some Anti-Venom) or a priest. Mages (Frost especially) shouldn't have much problem assuming that they have bandages and potions at the ready. I'm assuming that locks shouldn't have much problem either. For other classes, I'd recommend hunting her with some other people, or pulling her to the Everlook guards. (Make sure that, if you try this, that you get enough damage on her so that you receive credit when the guards kill her.) (I also don't know if it's possible to do anymore. It would help if someone would confirm this for me.) Of course, depending on your gear and level, you may have a little or alot of trouble dealing with her. I'd always reccomend finding a group.

For those without a UI, she's in the wilderness ranging from a little below the frozen lake going south past the group of elite dragonkin. She goes south from there. I would recommend waiting for her around an alliance NPC along the road leading south. You should find her around there. If you want to hunt for her in the wilderness, following the listings of coordinates on Brumeran's page (Click the Brumeran Slain link) should give you a good idea of her path.

Coords are roughly 36,36. The area is a big lake on your map, it is pretty hard to miss it.

I soloed this very easily with my level 29 priest, never got below half health once. These mobs do have a spell that cuts your accuracy in half, so I can see how that could cripple some melee classes.

The objectives for this quest are stationed all around the area, some underwater and some on the coast. I'm fairly sure you could complete this quest without stepping foot in the water or fighting any elementals, but it would take much longer.

Its worth noting that the elementals in this area drop Bubbling Water in great quantity, which is an excellent mana healing drink for casters.

If you have herbalism and you turn on Find Herbs, the objectives for this quest will appear on your minimap. | You can find the lake at 35,35. Most of the plants needed are underwater. The elementals are immune to ice. | Being a herbalist helps this quest. Find Herb will show Incendia Agave on the minimap.
Last edited by 32172 on 2008/02/20 (Patch 1.12.1) | Subject: ""Scalding Elemental""
Mob called Scalding Elemental is one of the most ridiculous mobs Ive every seen.  I tried to kill him at lv29 and I gave up (Fire Mage) I can solo lv34 elite but not this lv29 normal elemental. :( Even though I'm a mage, all my gears are concentrated for stamina, so I have about 1000 HP at lv29, ok, so I tried to kill scalding elemental and I laughed so many times.  This is not even funny.  Immune to ice, (Ice mages gg) nova doesn't work and it runs fast, uses a firespell that does about 150dmg+3sec stun (can't break stun w/ blink).  And hits around 80 per hit.  That means, For each firespell he can do about 200+dmg w/o him getting hit.  Fireball? My fireball usually does like 190dmg but it takes down his HP only about 10% (high resist to fire) And you don't have enough time to cast third one.  Or not even second one, cuz he casts that stun spell on you.  No nova, no blink, immune to ice.  Scalding Elemental is not soloable by mages... I have no idea why blizzard designed mob like this.  I already have a lv60 character and Ive never seen any normal mobs unsoloable by any kind of classes. (Yes, I tried to run away from this scalding elemental and it followed me all the way to the elevators of Freewind Post. GG) | I found the mobs hard to kill in close combat.
Fist of all, they DPS is crasy. Everytime they hit me, they damage around 90. And when they critt they damage is on 130. Sometimes the mobs uses a stun that last 3 sec. They even uses a curse or something that gives you 30% chans to miss. For casters they are not so hard but look out rogue, warrior, pala and drood, you wont take 2 at the same time. | Subject: ""24 druid""
Doable as a 24 druid at 33,33.

With decent to good gear you can take one of the elementals at a time with perfect tactics and execution, there's two spawn spots for the agave that you can stealth to with just one elemental kill. | Subject: ""info""
The best location to collect these agave is at: 36,38. A couple of the plants are on land and the rest are in the water. Solo'd this one at 29 with a 28 pet. Easy enough to do but you need the watch the aggro range on the elementals. It's a bit hard to see underwater already with there is the added effect of steam and haze in this water.

My results:
You gain 2200 experience.
Received 22 Silver. | The quest giver says northeast, but it's really just east. | They are all around the lake(Has no name, but it's in the Darkcloud Pinnacle area). The plants are orange/brown and scattered all throughout the lake.

To get the quest:

Go to LBRS. From the entrance, go right up the ramp to the right. Jump down. You will see a mob with two dogs, etc...there is a door to the left...go through the doors; turn with the hallway...when you come out into the next room...turn  directly right and jump down on the ledge...run along the ledge and jump down one more level to the ground...there you will see mobs under camps...behind the first camp to the right you will notice an opening to a ramp which heads downward...fight the mob or use invisibility potion and then go down that ramp. At the bottom you will see the body where you can obtain this quest. You must be an armorsmith. After you get the quest...loot the same area again and you will get the Unfired Plate Gauntlets. You will need both the quest and the Unfired Plate Gauntlets item.

1. Return to Winterspring and to turn in the quest to Malyfous Darkhammer in Everlook. He will give you a follow-up quest to get him some mats.

3. Note: it's easiest to get these mats before you turn in the quest in the first place so you'd save a trip.

First thing nobody has mentioned yet is that one of Chiefy's bodyguards is a shammy who heals. TAKE THAT ONE OUT FIRST. Sent in felguard, chewed that one down easily, howl to scatter the rest while healing felguard, then DoTted everybody still standing. When felguard went down I called an infernal in at the cave mouth who made short work of the remaining Ursa and chief. You can probably pull this same trick at much lower level, whenever you get an infernal. The infernal's 'AoE stun on arrival' effect gets really handy when a 59 elite is chewing on your eyebrows.
Finished at 90% health, 30% mana, first time through, so the infernal might've been overkill...I could have tried to keep the felguard up instead. Anyhow, it should be a cakewalk if you just DoT and fear and heal your own demon, same as Kroshius in Felwood."

You might need to increase graphic settings to see the difference between the two book types. | The trick with this quest is to carefully examine the books on the floor. ""Trapped"" tomes that spawn guards have a clear white/gray split on their pages, whereas the real thing has a smooth transition from white to gray. This may only become apparent if you zoom in and highlight a book, but it's worth it to avoid unneccessary fights.

Also, if you're doing this as a 'lock, use Life Tap and Hellfire to suicide in and out, as you won't lose durability and won't have to fight to undead out front. | I can 100% confirm that the real book definitely looks different from all of the other books, I just did the quest yesterday and posted about this here on the book's page a few minutes after.

First and foremost, the fake books are indeed all bottom half white pages and top half gray pages.

Secondly, the fake book pages look to be a lower texture resolution. They don't look like actual pages if that makes any sense. The real book's pages will look like pages are supposed to look. When you see it, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

And be sure to hover your mouse over the books to light them up some, the room is rather dark. :) | Subject: ""kay""
Building located at 43,68. Inside there is a bunch of musty tomes second one i clicked on turned out to be the quest item. Do not know if it is random or not but i found it in the very book in the very top right hand end of the room. Hope this helps :) | It is completely possible that at some point there is no ""real"" book spawned. By using the fake ones, eventually a real one spawns. It took me 12 fake ones to spawn a real one. | Subject: ""The Real Book""
If you look at all the books in the room, they are dark blue on the bottom and light blue on the top.

The real one is light blue on the bottom and the top.

You can avoid corpse running as long as you inspect them carefully. | Subject: ""The pages""
The guy that pointed out that the books with half light and half dark pages are all the Ruined Tomes and the one that is all the same shade is the quest book was Dead on. I picked up 7 Ruined tomes fighting those stupid guardians before I read his post. After reading it I zoomed to 1st person and looked at all the books until I found one all the same color and that was the right one.

On a side note, you can get a room with ALL ruined tomes, if you do you have to pick some up and wait for the respawn. | Subject: ""Here's what the real vs fake book look like""
Real vs Fake

Edited, Wed Aug 3 14:10:49 2005 | Subject: ""Works in 1.10""
Just did it - though I inspected every book first and they were all top grey, bottom white.  Figured they'd fixed it and started clearing clockwise from the entrance.  Cleared them all without any luck.  Of course more than half of them had re-spawned by the time I got done with the last one, so I inspected the re-spawns and sure enough, one was a blended grey.  Popped it and out came the Annals.

So the color trick still works - but it appears there's no guarantee that at any given time that the book will be there.  Might have to open a few duds to get the good book to spawn or come back later after some other sap has gone through a mess of them and given up not realizing that one of his respawns was the good one. | Leads to Brother Carlin (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5210)

Finally got the book when I tried this method. 

1)Turn up the Gamma in the video options screen

2) Look at the spines of each book.  The correct book has a faint, but noticeable 'X' on the spine.

1: Wrong ones can spawn 0,1, or 2 guys to kill you.  Generally 55.

2: You get instantly debuffed with -25% speed and 33%  more time between attacks

3: One type of guy gives you a debuff that stacks up to 5 times.  Debilitating Disease or something.  Each stack is -20 stamina and -20 strength, and it lasts 2 minutes.  Each time it stacks again the 2 minutes is reset.  So plan on doing this with -1000 health and -100 Strength.  I'm a 55 rogue and it was annoying, but I never died.

Here are 2 pics of what the real one looked like.  Front and back.

However in my case the the whole room was just full with false book, so I needed to loot some of them until right book spawend.
Last edited by BigBadNoodle on 2020/11/20 | This is a pretty frustrating quest if the book takes a while to spawn.

Basically, you're looking for a book with pages that are ALL the same shade of gray. You'll notice most (if not all) books in the room are black on top and white on bottom. Clicking these will spawn 1-2 lvl 56 ghouls.

If the book with evenly gray pages isn't there, you'll need to start clicking and looting the others (i.e., useless tome) to force them to respawn. I had to respawn at least 20 of them before I finally got the Annals of Darrowshire to drop. | As already said, the real book isn't two toned and it is obvious when you see it.

However it's important to note that despite posts here saying 'got it first time', it isn't always there ready and waiting.
I had to use four trapped books before this one spawned (no-one else doing the quest)."

Get the quest that starts the chain in UBRS from Awbee.

Go to Winterspring and either make the double jump(which I am pretty sure got fixed in a recent patch) or you can suicide through the cave and stand on the rune.  If you are unsure where the rune is, die at the end of the cave where Scryer is and look in the room till you see a small blue circle.  All you have to do is stand on the rune for less than a second and you will get teleported.  Also, make sure you strip if you can before you do this because since the dragons stun, it takes a few deaths.

After you talk to Haleh and accept the quest and all that good jazz, you will get teleported to the lake in WPL.  Get out of the lake and run around to the west side of Andorhal and there is a big farm house thing.  Kill several of the mobs in there so you can get to the room on the top story.  Talk to the elf in there and complete his quest and he will tell you to go look at the book.  Look at it and accept.  Look once more and you should be able to accept the quest for the epic gear.

Also, I'm pretty sure you can find the Blood of Heroes in EPL, the Chromatic stuff should be in UBRS, and the Skin is in Scholo. | follow-ups:

Getting into the room with the cage and trying to pull the 55 demon was less so. He brought with him the 54 warlock, two 53 guards, the Notre Dame Marching Band and the entire population of Racine, Wisconsin, all of whom had some version of stun. I guess there was a convention in town. My 54 Feral lasted about 27 nanoseconds in that inferno. There were so many creatures on the screen, some of them fell out onto my desk. I must have been in the wrong cave since everybody else seemed to have such as easy time. So proceed with caution and hope you run into the B team or maybe bring a friend?

Presumed to exist.  Only a greater chromatic dragonkin or dragon could pocess such a carapace.

Information on the Chromatic Scale

Commonly found on the lesser chromatic flight: Whelps, Broodlings, lesser wyrmkin.

Information on the Blood of Heroes

Legend claims that in places of extreme conflict, across what is now known as the Plaguelands; clean and holy springs may erupt from the ground.  The water from those springs has been named 'Blood of Heroes,' by artisans and commonfolk alike - in honor of those that fell in the war against the Scourge.

Information on the Frayed Abomination Stichings

The threads that holds together the abominations of Stratholme are highly sought after by artisan craftsmen:  Extremly resilient - nearly unbreakable.

Information on the Skin of Shadow

The quest works like this. In upper blackrock spire (Raid Section). Behind the arena are two blackrock thugs on a ledge kill them and a broodling spawns named awbee. Thats the start of the quest from there you do some running around to Haleh ect just follow the quest line untill you get to the book in western plaguelands.

Chromatic Carapace = Gyth (Epic)
Only one i have ever seen drop is mine possible to come from general too maybe.

Flayed Ambomination Stitches = Stratholme stitches the ones just before Baron Rivendare. This is probably your biggest pain when doing the quest.

Brilliant Chromatic Scales = Upper blackrock spire off chromatic dragons. I got most of mine through the rend event but they drop by general too.

Blood of Heroes = Eastern/Western plaguelands there are little pool objects scattered all over. When you loot them 1-2 elite 59's spawn. Just run

I wouldn't do this quest unless you get a carapce to drop. I was lucky enouph to get one and do the quest and it was definately a pain.

There are Paladins there though, so obfuscate past them with stealth and pick their pockets too because they are oblivious, mwahaha.  Go inside the town hall and apply Crippling Poison to your weapons.  Sap one Pally, then get the other one to aggro you.  Run to the other end of the hall and stab him till the Crippling effect works.  Sprint to the Libram and voila, the slow ass bastard will never make it in time!  Escape by whatever means you find appropriate.  Easy easy! | Subject: ""just to let u know""
These items are in WESTERN PLAGUELANDS, not eastern.  The quest is in eastern, so it's easy to assume they're in eastern. | The libram is in the house looking like the Southshore Inn, first floor, inner room, on a table. It glows.

You can avoid fighting into hearthglen, if you have done the quest ""Scarlet Subterfuge"" before. Just talk to ""Myranda the Hag"", get the Scarlet Illusion buff and walk into Harthglen to get the book.

When you loot the book, the Scarlet Illusion will get removed.

Be warned, the Night Elf wants to recover his gear and heads deeper into the complex. Do not solo unless over leveled. | Subject: ""Quest Info""
This quest ain't too bad, first you have to find the Blood key which is a random drop from the mobs inside the shadowhold, I found mine from a mob around the Elf's cage. When you find it Right click the key to get the quest accept it and talk to the elf (spent a while wandering why the cage didn't open while I kept right clicking it). She then says she needs her gear so she goes further in the cave. DO not be fooled even for a 48 this elf kickz azz she can tank the mobs of her level (for a good time but she'll die eventually).

My plan was I went ahead (since my agro circle was smaller) and pulled mobs to her, and we dpsed the down one by one. THings went smoothly until you reach  a open area inside the cave (as in it has a large amount of space) and she sees her gear. Immediatly I pulled the mons to the left and killed them then all the other mobs (not 2 many) when the place was cleared she went to go get her gear which makes her likie 3 times stronger. When she gets it she makes some comment and 3 lvl 55 mobs spawn. Since the place was cleared no other mobs came with the 3 55's so I let her go ahead and tank 2 while I dpsed the other down. Then took the second and we dpsed the third *occasionally take a look at her health to see how she's faring*. After all this she decides to get out of the place, I followed the steps of pulliing ahead as I did in the beginning. When I was about to reach the entrance of the cave pull the 2 guards standing guard of the entrance and killed them. She then goes through a speech of trey and this 53 elite pops out, he hits hard and fast so fight wisely. When he dies the quest will complete and she'll just run off. I attempted this thrice on a 56 druid on a low pop server (not one was around). Hope this was helpful :D. | Subject: ""Supplemental info""
As always, right-clicking on the key starts the quest. My key dropped inside Shadow Hold while killing mobs to do ""Dousing the Flames of Protection.""

Arko'narin can be found inside Shadow Hold. See Toabo's post for the location.

Once inside the Shadow Hold, the location of Arko'narin shows up as yellow dot on the mini-map. So, finding her is not a problem.

Completing this quest leads to Rescue From Jaedenar.

Edited, Mon Dec 19 01:31:45 2005 | Subject: ""Basic outline""
Kill enough Jaedenar and this key should drop. Once it does, enter the underground lair (Shadow Hold?) that is located in the NW corner of the camp. (NW of the corrupted green moonwell in the rear of the camp). Once inside, you'll follow the ramp down and eventually come across Arko'narin in a wooden cage. Talk to her to complete the quest. | Subject: ""Failed on first attempt""
The quest is not nerfed.  To start it you don't click on the cage, you click on her inside the case and talk to her.  This completes the key quest.  Then she asked you to accept a send quest to escort her.  If you fail on th escort quest the first time, you can abandon the quest in you quest log and get it from her in the cage again.  You do escort her down to get her gear and back out and once outside elite Trey's ghost appears and you have to fight him.  Turn in is at Emerald Santuary and you get the next quest to rescue Trey's remains."
5203,Rescue From Jaedenar,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5203,"This is actually not that hard of a quest, except when Arko'narin finally gets her gear. Once you get to the big room where her gear is located, she gets excited and runs right to it. She will likely pull two mobs. If you can get in front of her before she says ""There it is!"", you can pull the big blue demon standing against the right wall. He will come by himself and Arko'narin will help you fight. After you put that guy down, let Arko'narin run to her gear. She will likely pull aggro on another mob, and you want that to happen. This puts her into combat and keeps her from changing into her gear too soon. Take the mob down and then heal up immediately if you need it. It's important to be at full strength very soon.

As soon as Arko'narin has her gear on, three blue demons walk into the room. She will charge them without hesitation. This is not as bad as it sounds, as she now has boosted armor and an enchanted sword. She also likes to use Mortal Strikes. Still, it's best to focus on whichever one she is attacking. You might also want to pull aggro on one, because she can't handle all three on her own. If you get aggro on all three, expect to spend some time in the air. The demons have a nasty pop-up attack and it can hit while you are in the air. They juggled my shaman for a few seconds. This limits you to instant cast spells and attacks.

The good news is that if you had to kill everything on the way in with her, the respawn is such that you will pretty much just walk out after the three demon fight. You might have to take down three or four mobs near the entrance, but that's all. Once you are outside, you might also have to take out the two guards on either side of the door. After a few seconds outside, Arko'narin will be charged by a level 55 elite, the Spirit of Trey Lightforge. Despite his level, he is not too difficult. The Spirit has an attack that reduces your Shadow resistance by 100, and of course it uses shadow attacks. That's why you don't want to start tanking right away. It's best to throttle your DPS and let Arko'narin tank a bit early on. When you see her life start to drop in the 50% range, open up and pull aggro onto yourself. If you have healing abilities, you can start even earlier.

My 55 shaman soloed this with no problem. Healing makes a big difference, however. | Subject: ""Details""
This quest follows from A Strange Red Key. It also can be shared. First, make sure everyone talks to Arko'narin in the cage once to complete the A Strange Red Key quest. (They'll need the blood red key that drops off the various mobs in the Jaednar camp to start that quest.)

Once everyone completes, then have someone talk to her again and accept this quest. Everyone eligble for the quest should get a pop-up window announcing that someone has started the quest and inviting you to participate. (Probably best to be safe and have everyone stand near the cage in case there is a proximity limit on the auto-share.)

Once she's free, Arko'narin will wander downstairs. She'll aggro several mobs along the way, but typically no more than 2, although sometimes it will be a warlock mob with a pet imp. You'll hit mostly level 53s, but some 54s and the occasional 55. She'll fight with you, but she's pretty weak when she doesn't have her armor on.

Once she gets all the way downstairs, she'll put her armor and sword on. In so doing, she'll pull three Level 55 melee mobs (the big tall blue demon things) plus any of the 53-54 casters that you didn't kill on the way in. She'll be more effective with her sword, but soloing this part would probably be tough. (I went in with two Level 57s, a 55, and a 49; we got through with barely a scratch.)

After that, Arko'narin heads back up to where she came. Some of the mobs will have respawned, but it won't be anything new. She'll reach the room with her cage and then take a ramp up to the exit. You'll need to kill the two guards that flank the doorway (they will certainly have respawned). She'll then walk a few paces out into the open and do a little dance for freedom.

To the east (the camp entrance), you'll see some blurred movement; that's the Shade of Trey. He's a Level 53 elite. He's mainly melee, but he gives off an aura that dissolves your shadow resistance. That's only a problem if you left a shadow caster alive. Otherwise, he'll go down relatively quickly.

Afterwards, Arko'narin freaks out and runs. Quest will complete and you turn in at Emerald Sanctuary.

The level rating of this quest is a complete joke. I tried to solo it at level 59 as a warlock and found it taxing to say the least. Clearing the mobs as you go through Shadow Hold is not too much of a problem, and there seem to be two occasions where 3 scripted Jaedenar demon types pounce you. As a warlock this isn't too much of a pain since I could banish one, and kill the other two before the third one popped, or rebanish it if it popped early.

What is a problem is that the NPC you escort has such a high aggro range (level 48) that you have to kill just about everything on the way, which put a heavy load on my mana. I had to bandage and life tap about 6 or 7 times throughout the quest, my soulstone and demon armour ran out half way through which meant spending mana refreshing demon armour, and I didn't have time or mana to create another soulstone.

To top it all off, when I got out of the place and the elite spawned, i had about half health and mana, he insisted on attacking me and not my voidwalker. The level 48 NPC pulled 3 non-elite adds from the area as we fought.  I sacrificed the void for a shield and resummoned him TWICE. And the bugger still killed me.

What a complete waste of time. Surely with an elite mob at the end it should be classified ""55+ (Elite)""? Take a group or reroll a warrior is my advice. | Subject: ""I havent seen anyone post anything helpful for this quest, so here it goes...""
Its really not that hard. SHE CAN TAKE HITS
kinda solo'd as a 55 mage.
its alot smoother if u clear the mobs between where she gets her ""equipment"", and her cage before you accept the quest. but basically if she:
pulls 2 ppl at once you: let her tank 1 and kill the other, then help her finish killing hers.

pulls 3 at once you: let her tank 1, sheep 1, kill 1, help her finish killing hers.

she ALWAYS reaches FULL HP by the time she walks to the next mob so dont worry about her getting too low hp. and if theres only 1 mob, take the time to eat and drink while she tanks it, then when ur full hp/mp help her. If ur already in combat, and ur low hp/mp use bandages or evoc while she takes the hits, better than you trying to save her and dying.
VERY IMPORTANT: Before she reaches her equipment ( the small tent area before the water) make sure u kill the mobs that you see when u first enter the room. You will have to pull them urself. because after she gets her ""equipment"" 3 of those lvl 55 guys spawn near that first camp and you'll have to fight them as adds. in that case, ur fuked.
its good grinding for a lvl 55 character to solo if u can. but if ur not fast enough to handle 3 at a time then bring a friend, it does make it alot easier. however,when i was escorting her back to the room with her cage in it.. the quest glitched out on me... and the NPC disapeared.. can u say WTF? by this time i had done it 3 times over and really didn't feel like doing it again... but aparently people have finished this quest so maybe it was some wierd glitch gg.

5204,Retribution of the Light,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5204,"To get Trey's remains, you have to go a little further into Shadow Hold. First, go back to the area where Arko'narin found her gear. Go into the water and kill your way through the slimes. Note to Shamans/Druids: the slimes are immune to Nature spells.

Continue going the only way you can through the Hold. After maybe 8-10 mobs, you will go down a hallway which ends in a room. From the hallway you should be able to see the succubus Rakaiah standing in front of an altar, which is surrounded by four Darkweavers. You should be able to pull Rakaiah by herself. She is not difficult at all, and if you've managed to make it this far, you should make short work of her. After she's down, you'll see a yellow question mark light up over the altar. Trey Lightforge's remains are on this altar. You can pull the Darkweavers one at a time. Be sure to get all four before using the altar. Once they are all gone, you can use the altar to complete the quest. Return to the Emerald Sanctuary to get your reward. | Subject: ""go through the water with the oozes""
Just to reiterate what someone said earlier - first - go back to Shadow Hold cave, where you did the escort quest, go in and allll the way down to where you helped her get her armor.  The cave does not end at the bottom where the water with the oozes are.  You have to go -=through=- the water, killing the oozes and the cave continues to go on.  Go through a bit more and you will see a room with the succubus in it and 4 warlocks guarding the body - the room does not aggro when u pull her - i am a 56 warlock and this was super easy for me.  Great XP as well.  The one thing is though that by the time you get to her, you have to fight your way back out of the cave =X

5206,Marauders of Darrowshire,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5206,"Be prepared to hate yourself. This quest has four layers of f*ck you in it.

First layer ~ The Mob you need.

You need Scourge Champions. They share a spawn with Dread Weavers, Diseased Flayers, and a Banshee-type mob that fears you every 15-20 seconds or so into EVERY OTHER THING AROUND YOU. So right off the bat you've got a 25% RNG on the mob you need being up.

Second layer ~ The first ""item"" you need.

Maybe my luck is just !@#$, but in WoW Classic I'm only getting the skulls -maybe- every other kill, so there is an additional 50% RNG, bringing the total down to roughly 12.5%.

Third Layer ~ The -actual- item you need.

Clicking the quest item turns the first ""item"" into the real item you need, only it doesn't, like, ever. In the 10-15 skulls I've collected, I've gotten a whopping total of ZERO resonating skulls. I don't know what the actual drop rate is SUPPOSED to be, but it sure as hell isn't 50%. Maybe 10%, and my luck is just really bad. If that is the case, that brings the overall rate of acquisition to about 1.25%.

Fourth Layer ~ You need 5 of these damned things.

With a realistic rate of about 1%, if your luck is anything like mine, you're gonna need to kill alot of these mobs. Like 500+ just to get the mobs you need, to drop the precursor items you need, to get the real item you need, five times.

I don't remember it being like this in vanilla, but my god in Classic this is brutal. | Subject: ""Here is what you do...""
Head due north from flight path in EPL, Light Hope Chapel.

Create a macro: /target Scourge Champion, and go for the highlighted mob.

Kill the Scourge Champion, loot the Fetid Skull and press the Mystic Crystal, provided by questgiver.

The Fetid Skull then turns in to either Bone Dust (trash) or Resonating Skull. Do this till you have them all.

For every 5 Fetid Skulls I got 3 Resonating Skull and 2 Bone Dust...

The path north leading up to The Noxius Glade is the place most likely to encounter Scourge Champions..

As mentioned above Scourge Champion, Death Singer, Dread Weave and Diseased Flayer all seem to be on the same spawn table. So kill them all and wait for respawn.

Stay away from Diseased Flayers if your melee. Naste 10min curse of -10% to hit.. yuk!... | Here's the NPC you need to kill:
https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=8529 | Subject: ""Useful info""
Solo'd with 58 Warrior.

For the people who want to know 'where are these at' , the Champions are in Noxious & Fungal Glade like the quest says.  They are scarce so you'll have to wait on respawn once or twice.  Just GO THERE!  You can't miss them.

The fetid skulls drop almost every time, use the mystic crystal that Carlin Redpath gave you to covert to resonating skulls.  They turn to dust about 50% of the time.

Sometimes I think people do more reading on here than just reading the quest they are handed in the game. | I farmed this quest at The Noxious Glade just north of Light's Hope Chapel.

The mobs you want, Scourge Champion, share a spawn with Dread Weavers, Death Singers and Diseased Flayers. The conversion rate of the item is not very good, so consider killing all of these as you also search for the Scourge Champions.

Personally it toook me a total of 14 Scourge Champion kills to finish this quest. So close to a 33% conversion rate of Fetid Skull -> Resonating Skull | /!\
It also needs Villains Of Darrowshire completed !

Otherwise it won't show up.

There are three locations for the spirits.

1. Corin's crossing (59,72)level 54-56 mobs
2. Browman mill (67,49) level 58-60 mobs
3. Plaguewoods (34,34) Level 54-56 mobs

There is no one great spot for them. They are spread out and are not easy to find.

For you low level i suggest you hit plaguewoods. But everything is spread out and you better watch out for a killer elite patrol. They have a deadly knock back.

Anyone 56+ hit browman mill. Everything is nice and together.

On another note, the ghouls respawn as stiches, plus the warriors and mages. So make sure you kill everything and not just the ghouls because most likely they will not respawn as ghouls again.

O yes this quest took me about two hours and i !@#$ing hated every minute of it. At least i leveled! Woot! | I used the location above (68, 41) on my Warrior, and it worked really well. Just on the first sweep through I got ten down, and it honestly could have been more if I widened my search area. Do NOT go to Corin's Crossing. If you can't heal, you're as good as dead. Even if you can, you will more than likely get overtaken by their summonings, and patrols that occur. I went there, changing from 68, 41, and I died before I even killed the first one. It was an open clearing, with one enemy... then two shades joined in, and then two mages. He summoned the shades (level 56), and the mages wandered into me. Warriors: STAY AWAY FROM CORIN'S CROSSING!

Personally, I think this quest is great, especially for First Aid users. The Runecloth drop rate here is great. I started with 2 Heavy Runecloth Bandages, ended with 12, and that's with my use of them. I didn't have to eat a single bit of food.

Oh, and that Ghoul Rot debuff will hurt you. It gives you a -10% chance to hit, which means you'll be missing a lot more often than normal, a LOT more often. If you're a class that can debuff this, you'll want to do so just as soon as it hits you. Great place to quest, but it can be a slow grind. | Subject: ""KILL UNDEAD""
what you guys dont seem to understand is that they respawn as ghouls for every undead you kill. so the reason you guys arent seeing any ghouls is because you dont kill any undead.

first off you have to do the quest to burn the archivists room in a 5man group in SC strat.

next, you have to kill Balnazzar to loot his head. this can be done in either a 5man group OR a 10man raid. take the head back to the LH chapel. (edit: the head can be looted by anyone that has the quest, not just one per raid.)

then he gives you a quest to kill baron rivendare. you have to 5man him to complete the quest. go back to LH chapel to complete that then tyrosus will prompt you to open the chest right next to him inside the chapel.

quest rewards are as noted by above poster, the choice of one of the three argent items. ones a shield, one is a one-hand sword, and i forget what the other is. | It's the box right behind him, in case you didn't realize ;) | Subject: ""Argent Avenger""

5321,The Sleeper Has Awakened,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5321,"This quest is a pain unless you cheat a bit.

The NPC follows you (not a predefined route), so all you need to do is to keep away from the road while escorting him to Maestra's Post. That way you can fight the lowish mobs in the woods, one by one, instead of going through the scripted battles (I don't remember how many there are, but at least two, both with three mobs).

Completed at level 18, failed on level 17 since I didn't stay far enough from the road near Maestra's Post (make sure you take the longer route:). | Subject: ""Not difficult, easy to solo...""
This quest can be soloed fairly easily.

(1) Just take the Evershade guy WEST of the road in Darkshore (you don't have to go far offroad, just into the woods a bit. Stay west of the road till you get to the entrance to Ashenvale. This avoids Spawned Mob 1 (the Furbolgs). You can go between the road and the Glaive--AS LONG AS YOU STAY OFF THE ROAD to the west side.

(2) Then follow the road to Maestra's till you see the little house. Then go offroad again, east this time, and cut around the big tree and through the country to get to Maestra's. This avoids Spawned Mob 2 (the Undead Guys).

This quest is really quite simple. At most you may have to kill a bear or wolf or cat or two. You do not need to go the Zoram Strand route -- unless you enjoy the scenery, of course. I believe it is your presence on the road at or near those two key positions that spawns the two mobs. Stay just off the main road, and you'll be fine. Good luck! :-) | Subject: ""The easy way""
The easy way to do this: Avoid the street, go through the wood straight to the beach, then to zoram beach and from there to the shrine. Only occasional animal attacks, no furbolgs. | Subject: ""I followed the road less traveled and that made all the difference ;)""
Go STRAIGHT west from where you get this quest until you reach the beach.  Then follow the beach south until you get to the excavation site and start heading southeast until you hit the road and follow it west then south all the way around until you connect back up to the main road and on to your destination.  I done this with NO fights at all, not even a beast.  Very easy. | Subject: ""Sleeper Awakened""
Take him to 27.36 | What got me confused was him falling asleep. Small chest beside him after you pick up the quest gives you a horn you can use to wake him up! | Escort NPC despawns when you enter Ashenvale during PvP event on SoD realms.. | You can skip the ambushes by moving through the woods. The NPC can be used to help finish quests in the nearby area as well. Especially useful on melee classes.

Lots of level 30-32 mobs around; some spellcasters.  Basically you go in the front gate of the fortress, straight up through the front door of the biggest building, around the circular corridor, and into  the main room.  By this time, unless you can stealth, there are probably a dozen dead bodies in your wake.  Inside the main room are another 8 or so.  The crystal is in the middle; whack it with your pickaxe and a level 37 demon presents itself to be dismembered.
The hand is loot on the demon's body. | Subject: ""Coords""

go to shadowprey village  which is far west of Desolance,about 25 70. go in to water south of village, look for cages, open them the talk to the Fisherman who is on the dock after u get 5 and there u r.... | Under normal circumstances, this quest is relatively easy. Just go to Shadowprey Village, jump in the ocean and check the shellfish traps. Once you have 10 shellfish, you can turn them in to Jinar'Zillen on the dock (in lots of five) to get your two fish.

However, recently several websites/forums have mentioned that the shellfish traps are good to farm, as they have a chance of dropping the Big Iron Fishing Pole. On some servers, that pole sells for upwards of 10g on the AH. Also, turning in shellfish yields about 55s for every 5 you turn in. As such, the shellfish traps are usually camped hardcore, making it difficult to finish the quest, depending on your server.

You need to open a minimum of five traps to complete the quest (and that's with great luck, as the traps sometimes yield vendor trash or even nothing). Good luck. | Subject: ""Ghane it's in the game ...""

This one is easy and you can do it while doing another quest. The best location for the weeds are just north of the mass grave yard on a tiny hill. You really can't miss it. The Doom Weeds clumped in sets of two for me. Found a couple that were just in the middle of the field by itself. Once collected you need to turn in to the Junior Apothecary Holland in the grave yard. Keep in mind he's a wandering mob and if you don't see him just stay on the path and keep your eyes open.

My result:
You gain 550 experience.

5502,A Warden of the Horde,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5502,"During Children's Week (The first or second week of May), you are able to obtain this Quest from the Orphan Matron located in Valley of Honor, Orgrimmar. | Subject: ""Total experience greater than 1650!""
I just finished this quest as a level 40, taking my orphan for a spin of Burning Blades on my brand new mount (it still has that 'New Raptor' smell).

The total quest experience is far greater than 1650.  However, you get 650 for each stop you make before turning the quest in.  With 5 stops, the total experience is 4900.  Not bad for just running around.

For horde, you get a set of 3 stops followed by 2 more.  The first 3 are the Throne Room of Lorderan (just above Under City), the Rampart along the Gold Road north of the Crossroads and just before Ashenvale, and the docks of Ratchet. 

Once these three are complete, the next two are available.  One is in Thunder Bluff; the kid wants a footprint of the head honcho Tauren on the top rise.  Last, head to the Raceway in Thousand Needles.  It's just north of Gadgetzan, or follow the road east of Freewind Post until you hit Shimmering Flats, then head southeast.  It's labeled on the world map, but even if it wasn't it's hard to miss.  The ice cream vendor was on the west side of the track with the gnomes.

I assume that's also a stop for the Alliance.  I saw a ""?"" Paladin who was kind enough to not kill me or my orphan.  (I wonder if you can kill  orphans; something to try next year!)

Sorry I don't have coordinates, but you really don't need them.  I had trouble finding the ice cream vendor, but once someone showed me I didn't see how I missed him in the first place.

All in all, between the orphans, getting a mount, and the Darkmoon Faire, it's been an exciting week.  All that's left is streaking Ironforge and making it out alive! | Subject: ""finish it or not?""
Would I be able to get another orphan after I turn in this quest? I like my little Grunth, he's always shoving rocks up his nose and asking me what ""zug zug"" means :P | Subject: ""Children's Week""
This was a Children's Week quest (second week of May, I believe).

So, you can only get it during that time. | Subject: ""Re: A Warden of the Horde [5502]""
As of patch 2.1.0, the whistle expires in two days (assuming it's like other holiday items that don't count offline time, it would be two days play-time: time actually spent online, like Engineering Cards). So, theoretically, if you only log in for two days of playtime over a year, you could probably keep the orphan for that long.

I think I'll try this with a bank character. It's possible Blizzard will have the whistles esplode at the end of Children's Week, but since they've built in a timer, maybe not. Would be funny to pull out an Orphan for Winter Veil and cry about there being no presents for him. Okay, not so funny. | Subject: ""Why this quest is red""
The difficulty level for this quest is set to 60, so that it flags up to everyone playing. If it were set to say, 40, then level 60s wouldn't see the yellow exclamation mark over the quest giver (of course, you'd hope that after 60 levels people would be smart enough to ask for the quest anyway...)

It's not actually difficult to do all five quests in this series, although it may be time consuming if you're very low level, and if you're soft and chewy and not paying attention you might manage to die getting to one of the Points of Interest in the first three quests."

I made one pass around that fountain thing in the middle, killed about 7 and it dropped. | The drop rate is not great, the quest can take a little longer than you would expect (it took me about 25 minutes of killing).

Based on the Wowhead drop data and the comments I tried both beach and up in the ruins, it finally dropped off of a Myrmidon on the beach. Many of the mobs in the ruins themselves do NOT drop it, so the beach might be a little better. Only kill Myrmidons and Sirens, which the beach is crawling with. | Grind for this down on the beach, the serpent guards in the ruins do not drop the item! | Subject: ""<Blank>""

5536,A Land Filled with Hatred,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5536,"Subject: ""Dealing with shared spawn points""
As of 2.0.8 nothing has changed.

When I arrived on the scene there was a full complement of mobs but only 1 Satyr (yes, I checked the whole place).

* Killed everything on top of the encampment and 2 Satyrs respawned
* Did it again and 3 Satyrs respawned

Look, any quest that relies on you killing the same mobs over and over is poorly designed.  At least the respawn time is fast.

This could be an extremely annoying (instead of moderately annoying) quest for a lower level solo, since it would take so long to clear the place to get respawns and there's a decent chance of getting killed by a mob respawning at an inopportune moment.

PLEASE do remember to group with anyone and everyone doing this (or similar) quests at the time, even if you can easily solo.  A group will finish this in no time even with unpredictable spawn percentages, and there's no sense fighting over mobs. | Subject: ""I love chicken and Pie""

for the ones who don't /tloc (including myself) Can anyone give a general Direction from the Start of the quest. or a General Location, from the Middle of Azshara. :-)

P.S:. No offense.... but i don't think people wanna read 50 posts about Whether you like/dislike or how fast you finished this quest. (Just staing my opinion) | Subject: ""Exact coordinates.""
21,61 were the exact coordinates. It didn't take long at all. Just a touch of running around to find the right types of mobs. | The location is 20, 65 ."

5545,A Bundle of Trouble,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5545,"The bundles of wood are easily gathered northwest of the outpost. Watchout for the prowlers and bears though, they can give you quite the trouble while doing this quest. If you have the Defend the Frontier quest you can complete that while collecting the wood with ease. | Update for Classic!

Guys, the easiest way to do this is go into your graphics settings and turn your GROUND CLUTTER all the way down. Turn your view distance as high as your PC can handle and BOOM, you shall see these piles from miles away. No tricks or hassle, just run around killing things for the other quests you have in the area and you'll see tons of these scattered about the trees. | Although the two quests above go together really well. Should you have already completed ""Protect the Frontier"". Take the time to kill the Prowlers. They are pretty good at yielding ""Stringy Wolf Meat"". Which is good for cooking.

The Bundles themselves respawn pretty quick. They are really close to each other. So you don't have to go all out looking for these. Making this a really quick quest for 775 XP.

For instance. I found them by trees at these coordinates:

76,62 (2 bundles)
77,60 (Near Murloc Camp - be wary)
77,63
77,64
78,62
79,61
79,63

You only need 8 bundles. So as you can see, there isn't that much searching to complete this quest.

~Lie | Subject: ""Quest guide by Thortok""
This one is pretty simple, there are world objects next to the trees in the area around there.  I tend to look in the trees to the north."

Demons guard each portal. They, along with lesser infernals patrol the area. Try and close the portal when (the partrolling demons)have just moved away from the portal.

A level 39 demon will pass through the portal and immidiatly engage you in combat. Do not fight toe to toe unless you have three or more in your party. Soloist should fight while moving backwards (towards the road). Oh, and watch your back.

Don't let their high level or the fact that they are demons entice you into farming these guys. They are very stingy with their loot. 9 out of 10 times, they drop nothing. | Subject: ""easy""
/tloc 50,76    for those of you that want a copy/paste tloc | Run to Mannoroc Coven and use the big ring portals near the road. A level 38 Doomguard appears and attacks you. Defeat him to seal the portal. The portals respawn after about five minutes, so if you don't want to explore the coven, locate three portals and make a loop. Be careful of patrols, several Infernos, Summoners and Doomguards have long patrol routes that take them right next to several portals. | Subject: ""2CENTS""

You get 3 waves of attackers. First wave is two lv14s. Second wave is three lv14s. Last is a lv16. Wait around for each wave to come. Last wave Sentinal Aynasha will run out of arrows and won't help you. Another minute and she will send you to Onaeya. Shes located at 45:90. | she takes ages to finish, even if you kill all the mobs, just wait for the quest complete text. | She's hidden in the hills, sort of difficult to find. 3 waves spawn upon accepting the quest, the first with 2 furbolgs, the second with 3, and the last wave with the named furbolg ""boss."" | You don't have to actually ""escort"" this NPC. You just defend the friendly NPC against a few waves, then the quest is ""complete"", and you turn it in in Ashenvale. | She has some ""unique"" audio-only voice lines.

1. Enter main gate at 56, 30
2. make a left
3. Go up free standing tower killing mobs on the way
4. When you get to the top, solo pull the outter two guards if any
5. Go through the opening of the tower on top and kill the seer and his buddy
6. Loot the seer

Note - this quest causes confusion because you can't see the guys in the top of the tower. Anotherwords you can't target through them, so many don't realize they are actually in there. | Subject: ""Sceptre of Light""
You get this quest from Azore Aldamort, 38, 27 in Desolace.

Go to Thunder Axe Fortress in Desolace to get the sceptre.
Enter the fort and go left. DO NOT go into the main building.
Go up the left watch tower (open, stick-built structure). There was an Augur at the base, a Felsworn on the 2nd level, and two Felsworns on the edge of the top level. Then inside there was an Augur with the Seer.

My main problem was I didn't go up the tower far enough. Once you go up one level, there is a ramp on the outside of the structure that will allow you to go up to the top. Keep climbing until you find the seer. Seer is always there and always drops the sceptre. | Subject: ""...""
For all the nubs who cant post...

Guys, the tower is inside the fort. Its the 1st tower on your left.

Its easy saying ""he is on the top of the tower"", considering the place is full of them.

If your gona help, then please do it propely"

The quest is really tough to do if u dont know how. So, as few of you said before, get involved as less as possible, just stay aside and assist a little. I soloed as a hunter level 32.
Note: If u fail the quest (as i did once), go to 40.80 where the caravan stops and wait them exacly 10 minutes, after that, the caravan start to move again and before they enter in Mannoroc Coven u should speak with the goblins and take the quest again!(leave the failed quest before that) | Subject: ""easy""
http://img67.imageshack.us/img67/3205/wowscrnshot040507071922tg6.jpg
The Caravan travels back & forth on its trade route.  After its southern stop & when it heads north and it gets to 45,75 west of Mannoroc Canyon one of the goblins shouts it needs help being escorted.  At this point it'll have a yellow ""!"" above its head.

Easy if you're 35+.
All npc caravan members will help kill if the mobs are close enough.
Two to three fights of about 3 mobs each, all lv 34-38 range IIRC.
You can heal any NPC if they get low on health.
If you fight a mob that isn't part of quest, any mob on side of road, if you bring it close enough to caravan they'll start killing it too. | Subject: ""What happens...""
Tried as a lvl 34 priest...

As far as I've seen there are 3 waves:

Each wave:
lvl39-40 Sorceress,
lvl38-39 Infernal (fire immune),
lvl37-38 Demon

I failed because the last wave just killed one of the NPC's just before the wave was killed... >_<

Also... I wasn't able to heal the NPC's you have to guard =/

The trick is to NOT GET INVOLVED too much :D
Just help a little with the lvl39-40 Sorceress but don't attract too much aggro.
The Kodo's can handle the other 2 baddies. | Subject: ""Fairly easy at lvl 40""
The Caravan made 3 stops with with 3-4 mobs per stop.
The kodo will charge against mobs so just pick one at the time.

Return the Quest at 62,62. | This is one of a pair of caravan escort quests, the other being  Bodyguard for Hire. The caravan in question patrols back and forth between Kormek's Hut and the junction just north of Gelkis Village in the south, following the eastern road past Kolkar Village, then along the road that passes through Mannoroc Coven.

This quest is done on the northward journey.

Rough timeline is as follows:
00:00 Caravan arrives from it's previous southward journey. Super-Seller 680 spawns.
10:00 Rigger Gizelton says ""Time for the Gizleton Caravan to head on out! We'll be back soon but if you cannot wait, head north to Kormek's Hut. We open shop in about an hour."" Super-Seller 680 despawns. Caravan sets off eastwards.
10:56 Caravan halts just outside Mannoroc Coven. Rigger Gizelton yells zonewide ""This is Rigger Gizelton asking for assistance escorting my caravan past Mannoroc Coven. I'm on the road east of Shadowprey village."" The quest then becomes available from Cork.
Once the quest is accepted, the caravan proceeds at a walking pace through Mannoroc Coven

There are three ambushes by Coven demons (infernals, succubi, felhounds).

After the third ambush, the caravan continues a little further, then halts briefly once it clears the Coven, where the quest objective is completed. The caravan then continues on at normal pace to the far end of its route.
~23:00: Caravan arrives at destination (time dependant on ambush delays).
You don't need to stay with the caravan after the quest objective is completed and can go hand in the quest at Scrabblescrew's Camp (where the Kodo Collection quest is done).

hes at the 27 ,86 | You can find Zaeldarr in a cemetary in Ravencroft. Once you enter the mausoleum, there will be a few mobs on the way down, which are easy to dispatch. Zaeldarr will be there with two other mobs. With a bit of crowd control, it shouldn't be too difficult to solo. | Subject: ""Another Quest""
If you are at least level 54, you should also pick up another quest that starts in the underground tomb where Zaeldarr is.

6024,Hameya's Plea,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=6024,"You pick up this quest somewhere around Zaeldar the Outcast if I remember.

For this quest you have to ride up to Zul'Mashar. You will easily find the path as it's full of troll scouts, around level 57 mobs. They have some drain life ability, they enrage and it gets harder and harder as you try to reach the top. You will find the mobs hard to kill as the cannibals are level 58-59 so you might as well can kamikaze, stealth or run in and die safely to corpse run. They also call for help so if you think you were safe, think again! You can get hexed, shot at, almost anything.

Inspector Hameya (71,16 or so) is a level 60 Humanoid that patrols around the graveyard - you can easily pull him solo but chances are you will also pull a mossflayer along with him so be careful. He doesn't do a lot of damage so he's fairly easy at level 58.

After you loot the key from him, run back to The Undercroft (28,86) and complete your quest on the mound of dirt in the back of the mausoleum, right next to a broken cart. There you go, rewards are crap but you might want to keep a cloak in case you need some extra arcane resistance! | Subject: ""Who cares how u did it""
Where is this guy,and unless u have tips for the people of that class, stop bragging about how u soloed it easily casuse to tell ya the truth no one gives a damn on how u soloed it, they just want tips or want to find the NPC. | Subject: ""How to Find Hameya""
  If you follow the road all the way NORTH through the eastern plague lands to the norther border and then follow the mountains EAST you will find a path guarded by trolls. Head UP (north) the path and you will find the area that everyone has been refering to. Fight your way (or stealth if you can) AROUND the graveyard and to the base of the temple.
  When you fight a SCOUT you will need to make sure you use an ability on them so they cant run away on your FIRST SHOT, or they will bring a number of other adds along with them. IF THIS DOSE HAPPEN! run up the temple steps and jump off to the side of the stairs. It will take a moment but you will eventually get out of combat and be able to go try again.
    Kill the mob at the bottom of the temple stairs, and use a ranged attack to pull the mobs one by one away from the graves. If you get too close to the graves there are mob that will spawn and wipe you out FAST. Wait for the Name to track around the side closest to you and use ranged to pull him back. Simple as pie. | Subject: ""Tips""
To start the quest: In the very bottom of the Undercroft (tomb full of undead trolls) there is a rather large scroll that gives the quest.

To reach Hameya: Follow the road towards Light's Hope Chapel, continuing North. Continute pass Northdale (tiny area with a small lake with broken houses) until it says you've entered the troll area (Zul'Marsh, or something like that). Ride up the mountain, or kill the mobs in the way or that have attacked you. At the very top should be a large clearing: a huge temple on the opposite side, with a couple litte buildings to the left and right, and graves in the front.

To find/kill Hameya: Its best not to even approach the graves, for three reasons: 1. They mobs there are close together, making it hard to pull one at a time, 2. Stepping to close to the graves makes additional undead trolls spawn, and 3. Hameya may suddenly attack you. It easier to edge around the graves, taking out the one or two trolls along the sides until you reach the temple stairs. Chances are you may have to kill the two troll scouts patroling up and down the temple. Once there, you will notice that Hameya circles around the graves, so he is easy to point out. There is also a space where there are no other troll mobs - that is the area you can pull him. Even classes without a range attack can get close enough without pulling aggro from the graves or other trolls (Paladins), but Hameya is a bit tough, especially for those 55-57. Stun lock him or keep him away from you. He may curse, poision, or disease you, so beware of the debuffs. Once he dies, head all the way back to the Undercroft.

To turn in quest: Head all the way to the Undercroft. To the left side of the building, there is a patch of dirt that you turn the key to. It is right alongside the building, so dont look at the graves. The quest reward is 90 silver, a sword, and a cape. | Subject: ""How to find Hameya""
All you guys have missed ONE important point.  None of you has actually said how to GET to the place where Hameya is found. You are all so pumped up (like other writers have said) on how EASY you found this guy to kill..... But nobody has actually recorded the ROUTE to follow to get to Hameya. We are all 55+ if we are reading this page, so we DON'T need to be told how to take him down. Ferget yer own MAJOR triumph, kiddies! Use yer experience to help others .... which is what these forums are for. | Subject: ""he is at""

Utahmar | Subject: ""Quest start""
You start it at the Undercroft Tomb. Right where Zaeldar(sp?) the Outcast is. Scroll is on the ground. | Subject: ""Could be easy if ...""
You have vanish/stealth or FD (feign death).  These trolls hit fairly hard, but the main issue is all their attacks and effects.  They tend to have a high aggro radius for L57, 58 & 59s.  They also have lots of nasty attacks doing shadow dmg, nature dmg along with typical rogue/warrior & hunt movies such as hamstring, confuse, and the troll special ""frogging"".

A Night Elf should have less trouble as they can shadow meld, but AFAIK either druids or NEs will have issues if they aggro to much.  These guys run when low on health and (again) they frequently bring others with them (before they attack you even).  This could be the result of the 1.10 (really should be 1.20) patch.

If you have no 'de-aggro' abilities this gets tricky - unless you like to die.

Your best bet would be to ride up to the barial mounts in Zul Masha'r.  Becareful not to aggro too much.  You can also take out some small mobs as need to help reduce aggro and give yourself more space to run.  Its key to use hamstring, concussion blow, revenge (with stun -if you have it) and anything else that will slow them down. 

The good thing is most of them are not undead and the undead ones tend to die off every so often.  When I pulled Hameya I got one ad.  I was able to kill Hameya fairly quickly, but even using concussion blow and 1st aid I was down to 137 health at the end of combat.  My nat res was around 61 and shadow res was around 83 and that did help, but maybe move tanking gear (def, amor & stam) would have helped...

On my way out I noticed a Pali with the Judgment crown getting ganked by six trolls... so - being that I was fully healed- I charged in and we took them down, but these guys swarm like flies (the pali was probably being a little careless to) and its fairly easy for these guys to dismount you with their knock down and frogging abilites.

Also to finish up the quest it is slight confusing because there are two mounts of dirt behind the Undercroft.  One is for the Tirion Fordring quest (that leads to Orante Adamantium Brest Plate).  The mound of dirt for this quest is just behind the Undercroft and next to a wheelbarrow.  The other mound is next to Fordring's grave.

The Tirion quest requires full tanking gear (for warrs) as five grave digger types jump you.  If you prepair - with a few pots, buffs (sharpening, good food buffs, etc..) and can charge in - a good tank with all teir 0+ tanking gear should be able to tank them (but its tough and you also should clear out as many moss flayers as possible).

And some info besides I solo'd this or that or I p0wned this (esp when you ad no other details) is just stupid n00bzers posting.  Details are key. | Subject: ""Hameya infiltrator is at..""
The Hameya Infiltrator paces around at the bottom of the temple's stairs. you can pull him solo if you wait for him to walk away from the other mobs, you just have to make sure and kill the scout/hunter at the bottom of the stairs or else they will cause you problems.

Also I think someone mentioned not to step on the graves I think they spawn more undead guys. I am a paladin and finished this at lvl 56, so it is very doable if you time it right :)

PS the shadow guys at the top of the temple don't seem to aggro, so if you are in deep trouble you can run up to the top of the temple, it seems to be out of the mobs' aggro range. Not sure if this is a bug or intentional but it helps."

The naga lord who drops the book of the ancients can be found on the biggest island you can find NW o your map. But before you can kill him you need to put the gem in the statue which is at the top Northern portion of the island. After that he pops up and you can start bashing him.

The sceptre of light(prequest) can be found inside the thunder axe fotress compound in the watchtower on your left when you enter the compound."

The quest is a reference to Ultima Online. If you died in that MMORPG, you turned into a ghost -- whatever you typed in ghost form, came out as ""OooOoo ooOoo Oooo"".  Napa Valley was/is an UO shard (realm), and the Knights of Chaos are/were a guild on there. One of the programmers or quest designers apparently was in that guild. :) Nice gimmick."

Noxious bats between 46,65 and 56,61 enough there from me to get the 20 in about 15 mins.

Monstrous bats at 48,38 | Subject: ""Not that hard...""
These mobs may have had been altered during later patches cause I had no problem finding them. Looked 'em up at thott and went there.
I even sometimes had up to 3 noxious bats in sight at the same time.
Only downside about these mobs is the annoying poison they make that slows your movement to 35% of normal and attack speed to 20% of normal... :/

Noxious to be found within the box outlined by these coordinates: (49,52) and (71,73). Level 55-56 beasts.

Monstrous weren't that hard either. They're just north of the ravine. Take the bridge to the other side and you're almost there. | Subject: ""A few things""
First the loc's for the Monsterous bats are all correct,  follow these loc's from east tower heading west then hit this loc (50,41) to finish off the 10. 

As for the Noxious bats this is how i did it... Start around (45,66) and head east .  follow the vally east but also look a bit north there are a few up that way.. 

Secondly for those of you that say this cant be done in a day...... I got this entire quest done in 1 and a half hrs.. It can be done if you dont sit on your dead butt and wait for the bats to come to you.  Look around for them you will have to kill mobs outside the quest but thats part of life. another thing about the kill them then come back a few hrs later..Why?  there spawn rate is only about 30 min.. by the time you get 15 or so the ones you killed at the start are respawning. | Subject: ""Ulifes littele anoyances""
monstrous at [70,50
              [63,49]
              [59,48]
              [55,46]
              [55,45] | Just head west from lights hope chapel, and kill north and south of the lake there.

Watch out if you're a caster, the Monsterous Plaguebats like to silence."

6134,Ghost-o-plasm Round Up,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=6134,"When the ghosts show up, they are not hostile. The ghosts with a blue aura can be pulled without worrying about aggroing more ghosts. The ghosts with the green aura act as normal though, so if you pull one of them, you will pull all the nearby green aura-ed ghosts.

For every ghost you kill, another will show up, walking towards the magnet. Use that to your advantage by pulling new ghosts before they get too close to the magnet. If ghosts aren't showing up or if all the existing ghosts have the green aura, just wait for your magnet to decay. All the ghosts will disappear and you can place a fresh magnet. | Subject: ""coords:""
its at about 64,91 | Place the provided crate atop the little hill at about 63,89 to use the crate and summon the ghosts. | Subject: ""Tips on Completion""
Having recently completed this quest, here are a few pointers to sucess.

First, the location where you drop the magnet is in a horseshoe area to the right of the Magram area. You will see that the entrance is sunken a bit in the terrain and you can see a huge arch before entering the area. You will know you are in the right area if you see skeletons walking around.

Once you enter the horseshoe, you need to clear the area, so start killing the skellies and then the necromancers. If you can interrupt the casters, do so as quickly as possible as they summon more skellies. Once you get to the ""bend"" in the horseshoe, that is the location where the magnet needs to be activated. You will know you are in the right location because the walls of the area will widen and you will have a good sized open area between the two giant skeleton bones on either side.

If you look at the ground, you will see a slight depression in the ground right in the middle of that open area. That is where you can place the magnet as that is the center of the open area and gives you room to work.

If you are soloing, you will need to re-activate the magnet several times. After you have cleared the area, right click on the magnet in your inventory and wait for it to activate (it will be about a 2-3 second delay). Then, immediately back up away from the magnet and up against one of the walls. Immediately, you will see the centaur ghosts appear. Five (5) will appear at first and each one you kill results in another appearance of a ghost. At this point, the ghosts will be neutral and then become angry when they realize what is happening. So, you have about three seconds to pull away from the ghosts, which is plenty of time. You will see text on your screen indicating what the centaurs are doing.

Wait for one of the centaur ghosts to pull away from the pack and pull that one to you. DO NOT go after it or you will aggro the other ghosts. Kill the ghost you have pulled and loot the plasm. If you pull when the ghosts are too close, you will pull more than one. They have a short link range for the aggro, so when there is some space between the centaurs pull one.

If you are soloing, then you will be able to pull and kill two centaurs before having to re-activate the magnet again. The ghosts will vanish into thin air. You should use the time between magnet reactivations to clear the area of any skellie or necromancer spawns that will pop up several times during your quest. Then, just repeat the process until you have your eight plasm.

When you are done, let the magnet expire and the ghosts disappear and then you will probably have to fight your way out of the horseshoe.

Just take your time, keep your distance and wait for the centaurs to separate before pulling.

Good luck! | Be warned they curse you with ""Curse of the Fallen Magram"" which increases all damage taken by 15%. | Note that the ghosts that spawn are lvl 38-40 and there are a couple of lvl 40 patrolling centaur that summon lvl 38-39 skeletons, so while you can get the quest at 34, you might want to go in either with a party, or after you've achieved a couple more levels.

This quest is good for experience, though if you die there is a long walk back from the Kodo Graveyard. Here is some information about this quest:

Slitherblade Myrmidon: (Warrior) Can be found at the small island at (33,22). There are also Sorceresses here sometimes. They have a high attack speed.

Slitherblade Sorceress: (Mage) Can be found along the coastline (34,37) to (41,22), or at the aforementioned island. However, they are not farther out than that - there are different spellcasters out there. They cast frostbolt.

Slitherblade Naga: (Warrior) Can be found along the coastline (34,37) to (41,22). They are a basic fighting class.

You probably will encounter other nagas during this quest, including different Warriors and Paladins. You know you'll have gone too far if you have come to Ranazjar Isle, and while there are Myrmidons here, some of the mobs on the island are out of the quest level range (36+). There are plenty of frost enemies around so Cold resistance is good, and water breathing or swim speed potions could be beneficial as well.

Other stuff:

- Good for rogues (Moldy and Waterlogged footlockers around)
- Good for herbalists (tons of stranglekelp)
- Helps to be on the Clam Meat quest, as they are close to each other.
- Watch out for the Deepstrider Searcher, 39+ Elite giant that wanders around the coast. | Subject: ""Coordinates.""

she pats from tyr's hand to stratholme live entrance following the road.  this should hopefully answer previous questions. | If you are a mage, you can definitely solo this quest by sheeping the Courier and then aoe down the 4 elite bodyguards as shown by Faxmonkey.

You can also solo this quest as a priest by using Mind Control on each of her bodyguards separately, let them die while under MC and then run away. Once all the bodyguards are dead, pull her toward the Argent Dawn's camp North of Blackwood Lake (not Light Hope's Chapel) and have the NPCs there help you kill her. The funny thing is that if you are still holding aggro, she will chase after you but she will be daze since 6 lvl 59/60 are wacking at her. Once she is daze, it's pretty much over and you can kite her however you like.

A word of caution: Don't try to kite her and her 4 bodyguards to the camp because the 5 elites are just too much 6 non-elites can handle. I tried this before, and the bodyguards slaughtered all the NPCs."

One thing to watch out for: I tried to pick up some herb while there and when I looted the apple disguise immediately came off and I was attacked.  Easy enough to eat the apple again and they left me alone.

6165,<NYI> <TXT> Archmage Timolain's Remains,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=6165,"Subject: ""Info...""
http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-general&t=4970408&p=1&tmp=1#post4970408
For some time now I have casualy been investigating one of the most interesting mysteries in Azeroth.

It all started when I was exploring a cave in the Western Plague lands long ago and I recived a bizzare item from one of the many silmes there: [Timolain's Phylactery] ( Timolain's Phylactery a scroll or roll (made of parchment), usually shown unfurled, sometimes containing lettering, signifying the Word of God.

Now this interested me because no one I asked had the slightest clue what this was. The single piece of information I mannaged to gather was that Timolain was an Archmage of some power.

Armed with this information I set out to discover more about Timolain. Considering that I had found the Phylactery in the Plaguelands, that was the place to start looking. A quick stop at the Bulwark for suplies yielded instant results! It seems that there is a Tauren there who has something interesting to say...
He talks about an Archmage who worked for the Scarlet Crusade by crafting them magical bows and guns of power. However before any of them were put into service he crated a special weapon of incrdible power for the Scarlet Highlord. Without warning he was killed by the crusade, and nothing more is known of him.
Now this REALY peaked my intrest as I had also been following the story of Ashbringer.

Timolain > Crafted a powerful weapon for the Scarlet Highlord
Ashbringer > Sword of the Scarlet Highlord

It seemed that my own investigation was tied to the tale of Ashbringer...

That had me excited and I made haste to the Scarlet Crudade's stronghold in the Western Plaguelands, Hearthglen, to look for more clues. After much searching the only thing I discovered was a small shack behind the barracks with an alchemy lab and a forge. Knowing that Timolain was an Archmage and a weapon crafter, It seemed logical that this was his home. Unfortunatly there was nothing there that could help me figure out what happened to him.

Out of ideas I returned to where it all started, the cave full of slime to look for anything I may have missed. Imidiatly unpon ariving I noticed something that had been overlooked on my last visit. At the entrance to the cave there was an old overturned mining cart and some tools and skelatons. The tools and cart reminded me of the same ones that I had seen at the mine in Hearhthglen. It would seem that the Crusade had buisness here, dumping Timolain's remains I assumed, yet they had been killed while doing so.

After sharing this new information with my friends, one of them mentioned that he had been in the cave before and noticed that the very same slime I recived the Phylactery from was for some strange reason, a caster. This was bizzare as slime are not known for thier magical skills. It was very aperent that Timolain was brought to this cave, and likely fed to the slime to hide his remains. However the slime that absorbed him took more than just his body.

Now it seemed that I had solved the mystery of Timolain's death... however the mystery of what had happened to the weapons he created was still unsolved. Rumaging around the cave some more I remembered a passage from a book I had read, talking about Ashbringer and fishing.
Now this cave is right next to a river, so I left the cave and went down to the river beside it. I found nothing there. Seeing as how this had all happened a while ago, I thought it might be plausable that anything in the river had been washed down stream by the current. Following the river south I found exactly what I wanted to find: the smashed remains of a wagon and crates agianst a bridge. Could it be that this wagon was carrying the weapons Timolain had created, intending to dump them in the cave with him?

I have spent many days fishing at that river now, hoping to reel in some clue. But my resolve is fading with no results, so I bring this story to you. Perhaps another can carry on where I left off and uncover these weapons, or even the Ashbringer it's self!

75, 59 | TBC Classic prepatch, it appears boosted characters are not able to receive this quest. I have this quest but boosted friend is not receiving it. She is Honored with Stormwind and level 60. The two requirements (56+) and (Honored) have been met. Perhaps due to boosted characters never having been level 56 where the first quest trigger is met besides being Honored. Unfortunately yet another one of the unintended consequences of adding something that was never included with vanilla or TBC original.

Update: Scanning the forums I see others are mentioning similar issues with The First and The Last.

Justine Demalier says: That One, Malagan. I know him. Dependable, brave, abd trustworthy. Force is his name.

Then few min later (was stil standing there idling)

Merlis Malagan Says: Force, eh? Oy! Citizen Force, Come 'ere. Highlord Bolvar Fordragon has requested that all able bodied heroes o' the alliance meet with him at Stormwind Keep. You just been recruited, mate! Get a move on!

Then i got the quest from ""Highlord Bolvar Fordragon"" in SW Keep. Meby you need to get pointed to it from those 2 in stormwind :)"

3. 28,74 | Subject: ""No need to engage Blightcaller""
This was quite a lot easier than it seems, because like the description says, this is a reconnaissance quest. The objective is to collect information about the enemy without engaging him (Blightcaller). The first remains can be found near the road on the North side between the bridge to WPL and the intersection to Darrowshire. I missed it riding through from West to East, but when I turned around and went back towards the West, it was easy to spot off of the right side of the road. The second remains can be found if you go due North from the first remains into the Marris Stead area and they are on top of one of the small knolls. From that spot if you turn and face West you should be able to the the house, Blightcaller, and the third remains. I just crept up to the remains from behind the little knoll until the curser became gold and looted them. It's uncomfortably close to the Elite and his hounds, but I drew no aggro at lvl56 and just sauntered away. It's very likely that's how the quest is designed to work (reconnaissance not combat), but the leeway is probably very small and creeping any closer to the remains than necessary is likely to draw aggro from Blightcaller. | Subject: ""Locations""
Nathanos Blightcaller's location is in front of the house at 26, 74.  This is labeled on the map as ""The Marris Stead"" and is just north of Darrowshire.

The remains of the SI:7 Operatives look just like human bones of any dead player, don't get confused and startlooking at every little pile of yellow bones littered around the house.  They don't move at all (once you get them they don't disappear so its ok to do this as a group).

Fredo: 27, 74 | Right infront of the Blightcaller, on top of a little mound
Turyen: 28, 74 | A little ways East, but still directly infront of Blightcaller, on top of a hill
Rutger: 28, 79 | Either follow the road East until you see him, or head directly SW from BlightCaller | Subject: ""FOR THE OLD.. (like me) or JUST REALLLY SLOW""
AND for those WITH OUT coordinates

If you look at the 'marris stead' place it looks like a horse shoe.  Down the middle of the horse shoe (if you notice on your mini map) there is a string of hills.. 2 of the bodies are on those little hills.  CAREFUL..this elite croud is a 40man.. MANY ADDS.. BIG WIPE-O!... but if you are aware of your agro.. you will be fine.

The bodies look like players dead bodies after they have rezd.. just an outline of bones ...

the 3rd body is south of the horse shoe near the road.. like maybe 10ft off the road at best.. 50 if you are a gnome HA! :D

I hope this helped ppl a bit more. | The three insignias are very close to the Blightcaller himself, a house up North from the road as you've entered the Eastern Plaguelands, almost on the same line as The Undercroft.

One is located on a hill in facing the house, the other is near the road (Rutger) and one on a hill closer to the Blightcaller.

You have to turn it in back at Chillwind Camp then report to Highlord Bolvard Fordragon in Stormwind Keep | Subject: ""co-ordinates""

6282,Harpies Threaten,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=6282,"Subject: ""Locations""
30,60 Harpies in view (beware Bloodfury Ripper elite)
33,66 Ambushers in view
31,71 Roguefeathers in view

Was unable to locate a cluster of Slayers. By the time the first Slayer found me, I had all  RogueFeathers and Ambushers, and 6 Harpies.

Note that in addition to all the harpies you are after, there are just as many harpie types that you are not interested in, mostly Windcallers and Stormwitches, and two elites ""Sister Riven"" (28) and ""Bloodfury Ripper"" (26).  Non-harpies include basilisks, fire elementals, stone elementals, and chimeras.
There are hills scattered throughout the Charred Vale where you can look around without being bothered, and mining is great (mithril, tin, silver, iron).

Recommend clustering ""Harpies Threaten"" with ""New Life"" and ""Elemental War"". | In Stonetalon is a place called the Charred Vale (coords: 35, 58).

You can find the harpies in there ^_^

You can also get there from a shortcut path at Sun Rock Retreat (coords: 44, 64). | Subject: ""Stay to the East""
I have run this mission on both alliance and horde several times and the biggest problem seems to be the flight patterns and mob density. Even people just trying to get through to Desolace or Stonetalon are going to run afoul of plenty of the mobs that are needed for this quest and there are two types in the respawn that are irrelevent to any quest on either side [Windcallers and Storm Witches]. So when any of what we are needing die, there is a chance that they will be respawned as a 'useless' mob [in relation to this quest]. That is why it is often very difficult to find the particular Harpy you need. You may just want to kill Windcallers [Storm Witches are farther East than we need to go for this mission] for a bit and hope the other types spawn [Harpy, Roguefeather and Slayers are red, Ambushers are colored as Windcallers].

You can stay along the edges predominately between the two Stonetalon entrances, though. The Roguefeathers and slayers are near the path to Sun Rock [SE charred Vale] while the Harpy and Ambushers are in the NE near the Stonetalon path from the Charred Vale. Ambushers will also extend to the point at 12 o'clock if you are looking at the map of the vale [due North]. There is no need to go farther west and if you see the Ripper [a blue harpy [elite]]. Then you have reached the edge of what you need for this mission.

And if you think this is a pain, wait till you have to hit Naga for 2 hours on a small island in Desolace waiting for them to drop ONE item."

this one was fairly easy, you dont even have to kill anything except the venomspitters which are lvl 17-18, beware of the pridewings, they are sorta easy to kill but if they link your toast. I did this at lvl 20 an didnt die a single time collecting the seeds. the second quest is another story.

What you are looking for is little nuts on the ground near the trees, you open them and get a gaea seed. for those that are tauren and did the amencorn+well stone quest, the sprite is exactly the same. happy hunting ;) | Subject: ""Hellstream (LvL 28 Warrior ) Guild - The Killers""
It's at 48.40 the seeds are little brown pods that spawn on the ground around the lake in Stonetalon peak.

And my name will be written in the Book Of Legends | very very easy quest.
first, you head north to Mirkfallon Lake. You cannot miss this lake so keep going north untill you see it.
Once you get to the Lake, you find Seeds on the ground, and you loot them. They are pretty big for a seed and it's colored brown, so it isn't too hard to find it.
There are mobs around the Lake but, you can always dodge these.
if your going to kill it, it's around lvl 23. | Lake starts at 50,45. Easy, they are the big brown things all around the lake. | Subject: ""info""
As the quest says, just head to Mirkfallen Lake. Easy to do, collect seeds and kill a bunch of mobs for sport.

My result:
You gain 1400 experience.
Your reputation with Thunder Bluff has increased.
Received 12 Silver."

The entrance To the ravine is 66.88 | Subject: ""Boulderslide Info""
The cave is at the very back of the ravine, there are a few types of monsters in it, casters and melee.  The monsters respawn VERY quickly (2-3 minutes I would say) and there are many of them, so it is more fun with a group but easily soloed.  The good news about the respawn is that the crystals respawn fast too, so you don't have to go far to get 10.

The other aspect of the quest ""explore the cave"" just means to get to where you can see the pool of water and what is across it, so go straight ahead that far. | Subject: ""Where to find""
the Cave is 62, 92

To find Mor you have to go up the path in Sunrock Retreat, that leads up into the mountains. Then turn left hes there with some water elemental.

You finish investigating when you reach near the water.

The guys in the cave are pretty strong I did this at lvl 20 and I died once, as a shaman. They have an instant 100 dmg earth shock.

THERE ARE 2 CAVES - THE RIGHT CAVE IS AT 62, 92
IN ONE OF THE CAVES THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL ITS JUST EMPTY.! THATS TH WRONG ONE | Subject: ""Confirmed""
61.93 is the actual entrance to the cave, 67.86 is the entrance to the ravine.

None Cosmos directions, from Malaka 'Jin take the main road NW going through Grimtotem Post until you reach a side road.  There's a sign that points you to pertanent locations in Stonetalon, hang a left there.  Follow the road and take the cave on the right up the hill. | Subject: ""Guide""
After you got the quest from the tauren upside a hill south for Sun Rock Retreat head south along the path. When you are near Malaka'Jin look to the right and you will discover a path leading you to the ravine. Follow the path and head to the right when youre inside the ravine. Then have fun attacking the kobolds. They respawn quick and the resonite crystals too. If youre rogue use stealth so you can discover the cave. When you reach a lake you discovered the cave. On the island in the lake there are plenty of resonite crystals you can pick up without being attacked by kobolds. Get your hearthstone ready and use it to get out of the cave.

Done it as a lv. 18 UD rogue.

Good luck and have fun | Stonetalon Mountains: 61, 91

For those of you who find the satyrs in Satyrnaar too hard, there are much weaker ones at Night Run (67,55) which have pretty much the same drop rate. | This is a great quest to do along side Warsong Supplies, as you have to kill Satyrs to get to the Warsong Oil | Subject: ""Not that bad""
I'm a 29 undead warlock and I found this quest pretty easy. Only took about 30 mins. Went to Satyrnaar (82,49 entrance). Couldn't find the oil though.

Bleakheart Satyr 5/7 kills (71%).
Bleakheart trickster 5/13 kills (38%).
Bleakheart Hellcaller 2/6 kills (33%).
Bleakheart Shadowstalker 4/12 kills (33%).

The Shadowstalkers use stealth, so, make sure you look out for them. Also, the respawn is quick. If you're a warlock, you should use your sense demons ability. It helps you avoid stealthed ones and look for the satyrs with the higher droprate. | The satyrs casts a curse called ""Curse of the blackheart"" wich I think is a pain in the ass, because it's stuns you random times for 3 minutes :("

You can do this one at the same time as the ""Between a rock and a Thistlefur"" quest. As you kill all the Thistlefus you can work your way up the to the Thistlefur city.

6482,Freedom to Ruul,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=6482,"Subject: ""A pain in the rump""
You meet Ruul inside the Thistlefur Village.  Go into the underground entrance at 38,30, then keep to the left when the path forks.  Ruul is the big polar bear in the wooden cage right where the path empties into the first big room.

You'll escort him out.  Be careful - as soon as you get back to the fork in the path, you'll be ambushed by three mixed Thistlefurs.  He'll head out the way you came in, go left from the entrance, down the hill, and then again to the left toward the gate. 

As soon as you get to the gate, expect another ambush (again, three mixed Thistlefurs.)  Be careful - a named level 25 sometimes appears in the gate area as well.  Once you're out the gate, he'll turn right and head a few yards down the hill before thanking you and sending you on to Splintertree for your reward.

I soloed this with a hunter at 25, but it was tough (I had to restart once).  I'd suggest clearing out all the thistles between the entrance and Ruul before you talk to him, otherwise you may find yourself fighting four or five when the ambush hits.

His sister is in the inn at the Splintertree Post.  I turned it in at level 26 for 2,400 XP, 17 silver, and 150 faction with Thunder Bluff.

If you combine this with another Thistlefur quest (Troll Charm and Between a Rock for me), it is worth the extra time. | Subject: ""Easy if you don't get all the adds""
If a quest can go wrong, it will go wrong for me.  And boy did this one go wrong for my 25 warrior.  I didn't even know it existed, but had to go deep into the Thistlefur cave to find troll charms.  Normally they spawn in one area and I can get them there, but this time I ended up going all the way in and found Ruul caged.

Ran out with Ruul, and we were doing fine, even when an idiot shaman trained two adds onto us.  Things got a little hairy at the entrance to the cave, as a Pathfinder was patrolling into the area just as we started fighting the two Ursas that stand on either side of the entrance.  This of course aggroed the Pathfinder and the nearby Totemic.  We got through that fight ok, and I thought we were done.

But no, had to walk him out of the village.  He very nearly aggroed an entire camp of furbolgs by walking too close.  Right before the village entrance, we fought an Avenger and Shaman.  Not a hard fight but left me at about 70% health.

I didn't have a chance to do any healing before he aggroed the village gate guards, two Pathfinders.  For whatever reasons, my warrior had a lot of trouble just landing hits on the Pathfinders.  We managed to kill one, but then a nearby Shaman joined in, along with what appeared to be a two Avenger/single Shaman three-man patrol, a wandering spider and the patrolling furbolg leader.  For those keeping score, it was 25 warrior and 26 Ruul against seven enemies.  Suffice to say I died quickly and Ruul died about five seconds later.  It was about to get even worse, as one of the furbolgs started to run off, straight towards the nearest camp.

You have no control over Ruul, so be aware that he will walk into situations above if the time is right.  To be safe, bring a couple of friends. | Subject: ""Horde only""
FYI this is a horde only quest. | Subject: ""Stupid Ruul deserves to die in his cage""
To put it bluntly, Ruul is a friggin' moron. He *will* walk through the *middle* of the furbolg camps, so expect aggro and links from 5 to 10 mobs at a time."

They are simply stealthing around x=68-76 y=68-74.
For those of you without cosmos that is basicly the area between the road south of Splintertree Post and The Dor' Danil Barrow Den-a little on eithier side and also, surprisngly, I found Sharptalon hanging around.
And the NPC is out in front of the tower at the beginning of the small path into Splintertree. I hope this is clear enough to anyone working on this quest.Please lt me know if it isn't. | Subject: ""info""
This quest is rather easy. Just stay south of Splintertree Outpost and slay all that you see. Every few minutes or so you'll run into a stealthy Night Elf. Tag 'em and bag 'em.

6504,The Lost Pages,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=6504,"Be sure to bind the pages together with the same character you will be using them with.

Let's just say I learned this the hard way and now have a bank character with 3 soulbound chapters of the Shredder Operating Manual.... | Subject: ""Chapters""
Chapter 1 = Pages 1-4
Chapter 2 = Pages 5-8
Chapter 3 = Pages 9-12

Starts and ends at Gurda Ragescar 69,71
3650 exp when done as a level 26 mage.

Right click on the pages anytime you complete any one chapter.  The pages then combine saving you 3 slots per combined chapter.

These drop randomly from just about everything every where in Ashenvale.  You will easily get all the pages while completing the other quests.  If you are short 1-3 pages, just buy them in the AH.

I would recommend making a ""mule"" charactor, buy him a cheap bag, escort him to any of the three major cities, and hearth him there.  Then, one can send the pages to their mule through the mail, and not clog up their bank or bags.  Send one extra of each page for your next toon for a quick and easy nearly 4000 points the second time around.  You can also use your mule to send cloth mats, cooking mats, or mats of any sort to store.

Sell the pages you have 3 and 4 of in the AH. | Subject: ""Location""
FYI, Gurda Ragescar is located at 70,71. | Great quest for getting exp fast. Buy them from the AH for 10silver a page and finish the quest for 3650 exp in 5 min of work. | Alternativly, get this quest as soon as you can and just do all the other Ashenvale quest. You can save up the pages you need and sell any duplicates for 10s a page, THEN buy the ones your missing. You could save about 1g this way, and you dont have to go out specifically to grind for the pages, as they drop from nearly every mob in Ashenvale | Subject: ""Soulbound""
The pages are NOT soulbound, so you can auction them.  Once you join them into a chapter, they ARE soulbound.

There aren't coordinates for any of the pages.  They are ALL random drops off any mobs in Ashenvale.  You can sit in the same furbolg city and get 9 of the 12 pages (I did). | Subject: ""re: lost pages""
right click the pages to form them into chapters.

i got 8 different pages doing the satyr horns quest. | Subject: ""Agree with Stinaf""
what Stinaf said worked for me as well... Great info.... I was gettin rather pissed at this bugger till I tried it. | Subject: ""info""
This is one of those quests in which the loot you need is random. I've killed everything I could and I didn't see any pattern at all on who dropped it. The good thing about the pages you need is that they are tradeable and you can sell them if you have more than one copy. I saw a few shouts for pages that others wanted to trade with. Solo'd this at 26 with a 26 pet and made it to level 27.

its not a glitch, shes not supposed to wait for you that im aware, as soon as you accept the quest she wills tart walking, just kill mobs as you go, no big deal. It works like the escort quests in FFXI, but no where near as hard ;)

*edit* oh and she is located in Grundig Darkcloud's hut, just talk to her after you kill him for the related quest and kill two birds with one stone, cause the NPC you return to for both quests are the same. have fun!

Edited, Tue Jan 25 11:18:22 2005 | Subject: ""1.9 Quest CAN be completed.""
After failing a few times because of the infinite respawn Ive put on my thinking cap.

I have finished the quest (L22 Warrior) solo.

This is what I have done.
1) Put on a shield and low DPS weapon (you dont want to kill them).
2) Run in WELL ahead of her so that she does not engage when you pull.
3) Pull the 3 mobs forward.
4) Kaya walks about 10 yards past the spawn and voila. Quest completed. | Subject: ""As an undead priest...""
Previous comments on how to work around the currently bugged quest has proven true. Here are the main points summarized.

1. You WILL fail the quest if you stray too from from Kaya. I guesstimate it to be around 50 yards before you fail.

2. She will assist on you being attacked, but her assist range is only around 15-20 yards.

3. Using these two pieces of information you can keep your 40-50 yard distance and pull the three mobs WITHOUT killing them past the campfire. (Note: make sure the caster is far away from her as well.)

4. While you keep your enemy mobs distracted it will take around 20 more secs before she will raise her arms and say something at which point you're already too far from her to hear anything she says. MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT KILL THE MOBS! Then you will complete the quest.

Extra: As an Undead priest, I shielded went into to pull mobs and moved while casting Devouring Plague on the caster so i could heal myself. On the other two melee mobs, I casted Touch of Weakness so they would hit me for less while I waited. I casted Shield when the timer was up and of course used my renew and healing spells. It's not that simple but it's not that hard as well. I assume every class will have a workable solution while we wait for bug to be fixed."

Bleh, it looks like all of the old comments are gone.

Here's where the Quest NPCs are located (sorry don't have Coords to give):

From the Quest Starter, run north until the roads ends in a ""T-Intersection.""  It will go West to Astranaar or East to Azshara.  Don't make the mistake of taking the Y-Intersection that you first come to after leaving the Quest Starter.

First One:
From the T-Intersection, run East about 200 yards.  The first NPC at the Splintertree OUTPOST - pretty much right on the road (not the Splintertree Post, which is just slightly more East and a bit North (you can see it from the road).  This NPC will wander up and down the tower there.

Second One:
From Splintertree Outpost, run East to Azshara.  This next NPC wanders the road between the Warsong Lumber Camp and Shadowsong Shrine in Azshara.  The boundry between Ashenvale and Azshara is the river.  The NPC will wander across the river 200-300 yards into Azshara.  (There is an Alliance Flight Path here and much higher level mobs so be careful and don't stray from the road).  Run back and forth from the bridge to the Warsong Lumber camp and you should find this NPC.  She rides a wolf.

Third One:
Run West, then run west some more, then keep running until you hit the beach.  Seriously.
It's a long run - you might want to make yourself a snack for this one.  Go back past the Splintertree Outpost, past the T-Intersection mentioned above and continue West to Astranaar.  This is an alliance town, so skirt the town to either side (south seems the most direct).  Soon after you leave the town, you will descend some hills and see a tower on your right.  When the ground levels off head west off the road (you may find the faint path the heads to the beach, it doesn't matter).  This will take you between a gap in the mountain range that empties out onto the beach.  Head south along the beach to the Zoram'strand Outpost.  There is a Horde flight path here.  Get the route and fly back to Crossroads.  Or, get a group and do Blackfathom Depths.  There are a few quests here where you can grind out some XP, but no Inn at which to log out.

Hope this helps. | Warsong Scout - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12862 (up the tower)
Warsong Runner - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12863
Warsong Outrunner - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12864 | Scout is in Splintertree post (71, 68). Don't forget to get the flight path if you haven't already.

Outrider is on the road between Splintertree Post and Azshara. Head northeast from Azshara.

The Runner is at the Zoram'gar Outpost on the western coast (12,34). There is another flight path there. | Subject: ""The Skinny on this quest....""
There are three reports to deliver, but be sure that you right click on the bundle in your pack or esle it will give you a gray ""complete"" bar that you CANNOT click on.

Delivery of the reports can be done in any order that you want. Easiest way is as follows.

Splinter Tree Outpost - follow the road out of Orgrimmar's side gate (the one by the Valley of Spirits) and stay on it until it gives you an option of right or left, go right and the Scout is outside the post TLoc 71,68.

Warsong Lumber Camp - Outrunner is on a wolf walking the road TLoc 81,55 thru 88,49. Leave Splinter Tree Post and head north again and you will see the Outrunner. Or go through the lumber camp from the south, go all the way through it and make a left on the road you come to.

Zoram Strand - Head South from Lumber camp on the road you find the outrunner on, keep on it you'll see Astranaar (Night Elf city), go around it to the south unless you are a level 60 and bored, head north to get back on road. Stay on the road unitl about TLoc 21,34where you'll see a dotted path on the left on world map of Ashenvale. The camp is in the Southern part of Zoram Strand (so make a left when you get to the beach and no playing in the water until 30 minutes after eating so you don't cramp). | Subject: ""Doh""
Never mind. You have to *open* the bundle for the reports to be there. I totally read right over that part. So anybody else having my problem, open the bundle. :-P | /way 71.05 68.36 Warsong Scout
/way 92.96 46.62 Warsong Outrider (note - wanders the road between Warsong Lumber Camp and Shadowsong Shrine in Azshara)
/way 12.21 34.20 Warsong Runner | Subject: ""Co Ordinates + Breif Explaining :s""
Scout    = 71,68, Next to a tower, near splintertree post

Runner  = 12,35, next to tent in Zoran Strand, Explained Below.

Outrider = around 84,50, SHE is on a wolf/mount, moves slowly, Stick around the bridge and you should find her.

for Runner at 12,35 you will need to walk quiet far to Zoran Strand which is on the west side of Ashenvale... When yuo get to Astrannar go around to the south, because astrannar is a alliance town that will attack, then there is a path that leads to Zoran Strand and PRESTO! your there.

+ if you havn't already been there, there are 3 quests you can get there from varios civilians!"

Hope u guys wont get in the ocean anymore =D | Subject: ""easy""
this one is very easy, these guys are lvl 15-17, they do group together quite a bit like the venture Co. do, but not too bad, they are found just inside the stonetalon mountains spread thruought the hills. You can find some battered chests around this are as well. The quest after this has you return to the same part only a little further in to kill a special mob. its a lvl 18 in a hut just over a little ridge from the first camps. He is gaurded by a few of these other mobs plus some lvl 17 sorceror types.

In his hut! you will find a lvl 15 Tauren female NPC, she gives you a new quest! escort her to the ajwa camp, which you likely passed on your way here. A few notes of warning! You cannot control her in any way, she walks fairly slowly back down the path, around the corner and back to the camp, for those who play FFXI this is sort like the escort quest. she will walk until agroed and then fight, if she dies you gotta go back. But you cant make her stop. Though dont worry she really does move quite slow.

A second word of caution! when you get to the camp, 2 mercenaries and a sorceror will spawn and attack her! I was not expecting this at all and barely pulled through. So if you can have a minion, make sure its out and your ready and come with two people, cause it takes a second to pull the hate off her. After you rescue her she will just disapear, you go back to the stonetalon entrance and talk to the tauren who gave you these quests, he gives you a reward then tells you to tell the girls aunt located in red rock retreat, this aunt is the same one that gives the cycle of life and new life quests. | Subject: ""location""

I have studied fishing EXTENSIVELY.  I've created spreadsheets on it and have analyzed the data from over 5,000 casts.  Here's the short version of what I've learned....

Fishing lures only allow you to fish in zones you do not have sufficient base skill, and when you do have the base skill they only reduce the probablility of getting a ""Your fish got away."" message.  They DO NOT increase your chance of catching any particular item.  That is on a purely random schedule after the program determines that the fish did not get away.

There is a minimum skill level at which you can fish any zone.  If you're below that level, you won't catch a thing.  Lures can help you get up to that level.  Once you hit the minimum, up to about 50 points above the minimum, the number of ""Your fish got away."" messages will decrease as your skill increases.  After you're 50 points above the zone minimum lures make no difference at all.

I hear a lot of people talking about doing better with or without lures.  Most people just haven't gathered enough data for their observations to be statistically significant.

Try tracking two thousand casts, and write down the results of all of them.  It's pretty tedious.  I did it mostly to ward off the boredom while fishing, and found out some interesting behaviors of the program. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
this is a reply based on the previous guys thread post.

I am ready to train in Artisan, where is an Artisan Trainer?

You learn Artisan level by completing the following quest.

Once you have reached level 40 and have 225 in Fishing. (I repeat you need to be at least level 40 and have maxed your skill at 225.)

Alliance Start: Starts with Grimnur Stonebrand in Ironforge (The Forlorn Cavern) https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=834/winds-in-the-desert

Horde Start: Start with Lumak in Orgrimmar (Valley of Honor).

Both send you to speak with Nat Pagle in in Dustwallow Marsh (Tidefury Cove, SW of Theramore Island). Approach from NW to avvoid higher level mobs. From Theramore Island you can swin directly west from the corner of the dock. https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1281/jims-song-change-to-gossip

Nat Pagle wants you to four different fish; Feralas Ahi, Savage Coast Blue Sailfin, Sar'theris Striker, & Misty Reed Mahi Mahi.

Feralas Ahi is a rare drop in Feralas (Verdantis River).

A quick pointer, to make this easier.
Walk down the path away from the quest giver, walk past the first tents on your right. Walk through Camp Aparaje and up the hill, then turn right into the Tauren camp there. Follow the path round to the right for 60 / 70 yds, killing all the mobs one by one. You should kill your 6 brutes that way. Grundig is standing in the first tent on your left. Easily pulled on his own. Enter the tent to collect the escort quest, whilst you are there. The Tauren you escort will travel back the way you came, so it should be clear of mobs. Beware that you are jumped by  three tauren when you walk through Camp Aparaje.
Take care with the casters with staves as they heal themselves.
Good Luck | Subject: ""lvls""

Be ready for battle when you do this! The first wave of attacks comes; it is 3 nagas. If you are a warlock, have your void walker tank one, let the NPC tank one, and keep the other mob feared. After the first 3 are killed, you will have about 5 seconds to eat/drink. Do it!

Next comes 3 more nagas, rinse and repeat. Again, you will have another 5 seconds to rest. Vorsha comes next. Just went down like any other level 22 mob. Good experience, worth doing! | Subject: ""Easy way to do quest.""
Well as long as you got the quest in your log it doesn't matter what level you are anyone can do it now.

Simply Follow the NPC to the Hill, Vanish the flame. Now you just need to die. Seriously. You will die and the quest will state you have failed the quest. Don't worry, just hurry up and revive your body and restart the quest. Vorsha will be sitting next to the flame. So now when the NPC gets half way across the water to the island it will get bugged and say you have finished the quest.

I did this on accident and I know have a ring to show for it. Seems I'm not the only one that has stumbled upon it either. GoodLuck. :) | If the brazier is not lit and you're not able to click out the fire someone else probably just completed the quest before you. Wait a bit and it should be activated again. Muglash is fine with waiting a while without disappearing as well."

If you're in range you'll hear some flute music play and then the rat will follow you. Do that 5 times, then return to monty!

I played at around 10 pm and I went to the platforms on either side of the quest giver. Then whenever a rat came near me, I played the flute. I had them all in under 2 minutes, easy.

<Skulli> Undead Rogue
Proudmoore Realm | In case anyone is still having trouble locating the road to Ravenholdt its 75,24. Directly behind the plateau thats north of Durnholde Keep. | HC'ers, no need to bother with this quest. Doesn't give anything except for the Ravenholdt rep. | Subject: ""Ravenholdt Quest Line""
Ravenholdt is located in the Hillsbrad Hill, in the north part of the map. It is nort of Dunholde. Do not get dicouraged if you can't find the path immediately, as it's somewhat obscured by trees ad hills. When you do find it, you will come to a cave with a single chest in it.

DO NOT OPEN THE CHEST

Use your detect traps spell before open the chest, and a blue rectangle will appear over the chest. All that is needed to complete this part is to have that blue diamond visible and walk really close to the chest. This will allow you to do the second section of this quest line. Follow the path through the cave to the second floor of the Ravenholdt manor.

The second part involves pickpocketing Syndicate Emblems from syndicate members. The best place to do this is the ruined watch tower by the road to Dunholde. You will not get any emblems from killing syndicate members, only for pickpocketing them. When you have about 30 of these (fewer if you're human I beleive) you raise for faction rating with this area. Note this is not a lggable quest, as each of the guards in the ravenholdt area will not let you accept the quest until you have brought them some emblems. You may do this part as many times as you like to raise your faction rating.

I have no idea what this accomplishes, except for finishing your Rogue class quest. Which is always good, neh? | Subject: ""loc of tunnel""
The loc of the path that leads up to the tunnel is 75,23 | Ravenholt Manor is located east-southeast of Tarren Mill.
You will have to go up the side of the mountain till you find a pathway leading further up the mountain.
At the top of the pathway you will find a cave.
You must go through the cave, however if you are a rogue seeking their ravenholt quest, as you pass by remeber to watch out for the chest within the cave as it is a part of that quest.
Once you are through the cave you will enter a grove with a path, follow the path and you will arrive at Ravenholt Manor.

As a note the Ravenholt quests are not completed, so keep that in mind should you attempt them you will eventunally hit a quest with no way to finish it. Just a friendly warning. | Make sure you have the skill Detect Traps. You can still see the trap without the skill, but your quest will not be completed when you walk past the chest.

If needed you can buy the skill from Fahrad inside Ravenholdt Manor. | Subject: ""April 15 2005 Update""
Got this Quest at 24
went to Hillsbrad Foothills
Found the chest
Used detect traps
Walked around the chest til the Quest updated
Spoke with Fahrad
Spoke with the Gaurds
Pick-pocketed 30 emblems off of the Syndicate mobs in Durnholde Keep
Went back to the gaurds
Turned the emblems in (one at a time as opposed to all at once.. very annoying)(and the gaurds only accepted 27 of the emblems before the ""!"" stopped appearing above their heads...
I then spoke with everyone in the manor, their reactions to my presence had changed from when I first went in. (instead of calling me ""worm"" they now use my Name.)
The Gaurd to Fahrad's Right says to speak with ""Winstone Wolf"" (Who is downstairs at  the table)
Winstone does not have any interaction.....

Contacting GM for update on Content, will post here if and when I hear anything.

Friday April 15th 2005 | Subject: ""Faction Quest""
You get the Rite of Cunning for just detecting the trap on the box in the tunnel.  Try to open it if you want to fight the lvl 33 Elite that spawns by trying =)

Once you turn this in to the Master Rogue inside Ravenholdt, he tells you to talk to the guards.  The guards want you to pick pocket Sydicate Emblems from the nearby keep.  Each one of these you turn in to them raises your faction with Ravenholdt by a bit, until you are friendly status.  I think it takes around 30.  I do not know what this does, but I assume it will allow the NPCs in Ravenholdt to eventually give you quests.  I did this quest at lvl 31, and no other quests in ravenholdt were opened at that time. | The easiest way to search for the path that leads to the Manor is to find location 76,25. It is in the Hillsbrad Foothills area. NOT the Durnholde Keep area. I am including a picture of the path from the bottom.

*Also. There is some good items for sale within the Manor that cost you just silver (~24s), but go for 2+ gold at the AH.

*And, if you are alliance, and do not have the flight path yet. Jump down the mountain side to Chillwind Point. It's north across the river. It saves you time later on.

Sorry. I don't know the horde routes.

Side note: If you collect the emblems from the NPC's in the Keep BEFORE going up. It saves you some time too. | Subject: ""Content Incomplete""
My advice... Don't bother with this yet. There is no compelling reward that makes the travel worth your time. The lands you have to go through have higher level beasts (30-35), and your getting awfully close to Horde country.

The official response I got from a GM regarding this is that the content is incomplete. If you have a few hours to spare and must give it a try here's the skinny.

1) You can do this at level 24, you only need to cast detect traps. Find the chest, and cast detect traps then you will see a flag that says don't open this and you�re done. You do not need to disarm traps as is inferred from other comments.
2) The next quest is to go and pickpocket a bunch of level 20-22ish thief�s and get badges. For each badge you get your reputation in the syndicate, goes up. You need about 30 to become friendly and you�re done.

FIRST NOTE: If you run into a series of pockets that say no loot, someone�s been there before you. Start killing them. Kill on one side of the castle, move to the other side and come back to pick pocket. If you bring a friend, have them kill while you sneak. The goal is to get them to re-spawn so they have loot again.

SECOND NOTE: The badges quest will never appear in your quest log. This may seem borked but it�s not. AFAICT This quest is a Required Item to Initiate quest requiring you to get the badges first before taking the quest and as soon as you take the quest you will complete it for a faction point. This makes it a little weird to turn in too in that you have to talk to a guard 30 times for each badge and press complete quest 30 times.

3) When you reach friendly status the guards will refer you to talk to the Wolfe. This is a guy in a suit inside the mansion. You can�t talk to him. This is where the content is incomplete as of 1/11/05. | Subject: ""The path""
I haven't saw one post here about the actual location of this path so I will post it. the path is located in hillsbrad foothills
the coordinates are 75,23 - that is the beginning of the path, then go up and after two turns you will enter a small cave, inside there is a chest, DO NOT OPEN IT, use detect traps instead, after using it you will see a blue diamond above the chest, go closer and the quest will be completed ( at least that is how I completed it)"

There is some misconception as to the amount of Emblems needed. As of Patch 2.+, you only needed 10 or 11 to hit Friendly. But in Classic, that's not true.

The Emblems only give 100 rep per turn in. As does the previous quest. So if you turn in the quest leading here (The Manor, Ravenholdt), you will start with 100/3000 Rep towards Friendly.

So you must grab 29 of the Emblems in order to reach Friendly status.

Done on an Undead Rogue, so no Reputation bonuses applicable. Humans, YMMV.

7385,A Gallon of Blood,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7385,"This is how it works. In the Frostwolf village is a small cave just to the left of the blacksmith. The primalist there accepts turnins of Stormpike Soldier's Blood, and once she gets enough she will begin walking towards the middle of the map. She's a level 60+ elite and has an entourage, so she CAN handle herself, but it's important to stay with her and keep her healed, because the Alliance wants her dead. Anyway, once she gets to the middle of the map, she will begin a summoning ritual. Once she and her assistants complete the ritual, a swirly pattern will appear at her feet. Now this is the important part: Ten Horde players must be there when this happens to right-click the swirly thing on the ground and stand still while the ritual completes. Think of it liked a warlock summon, where people have to right click the portal. This works the same way.

If the primalist makes it to her spot and summons, and if ten Horde players assist her in summoning, she will summon Lok, who basically looks like a pale blue earth elemental. He will go to the center of the map and chill (pun intended) for ten minutes. During that time, he will attack any Alliance that get too close. He's VERY strong, but be careful that you don't let the Alliance kite him away. Each time he defeats an Alliance player, he will grow in size and power. After the allotted ten minutes, he will begin going on a rampage and destroying everything in his path. The Alliance will attempt to kite him, so it's very important that warriors, druids, mages.. anyone with an intercept stays with him. Lok is VERY powerful but he's rather stupid. As soon as one person has aggro from him, he will stay on that person until they're dead no matter where they take him. So, it's important to keep the Alliance from defeating him or letting him get pulled to some random corner of the map. | Subject: ""Ok!""

7386,Crystal Cluster,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7386,"Subject: ""Woodlord Bossmob""
With enough crystals the bossmob of the Alliance can be summoned which is almost certainly a turning of the tide for the Alliance.

We certainly turned in at least 10 times and the quest giver still said he needs more, so I dont know exactly how many it takes to call the boss.

c. Talk to Lady Katrana Prestor who is just across from Fordragon
d. Talk to Salomon in Lakeshire again
e. Talk to Marshal Maxwell back in the Burning Steppes

g. Talk to Marshal Maxwell again

From here you need to go to Blackrock Depths and talk to Marshal Windsor. He will tell you to return to Marshal Maxwell again with the quest Abandoned Hope.

At this point, it seems the quest just runs into a dead end because Marshal Maxwell does not give you any further quests. You need to go back to Blackrock Depths and kill mobs there for a random drop called A Crumpled Up Note. Right-clicking the item will set you back on a quest to Marshal Windsor.

Windsor gives you the quest A Shred of Hope, which is to retrieve lost information from Golem Lord Argelmach and General Angerforge. You return this to Marshal Windsor.

The next part is a bit hard - you need to escort Windsor from his jail cell. Make sure the area is cleared of mobs before you do this. The quest is called Jail break!

After escorting Windsor out, go talk to Marshal Maxwell. He will give you a quest called Stormwind Rendezvous, which can be done solo if you stay away from the battle.

Talk to Bolvar just after the fight. He will give you The Dragon's Eye. This means you have to go to Winterspring to find Haleh.

After this, go to Upper Blackrock Spire and kill Drakkisath for the Drakefire Amulet. Kill Drakk and loot the blood.

Return the blood to Haleh in Winterspring and she will give you the key to Onyxia. The Drakefire Amulet attunes you to Onyxia's lair, which allows you to kill Onyxia and return the head to Bolvar in Stormwind. | Horde version:
 Head of Onyxia gives  Victory for the Horde which leads to  For All To See.

Alliance version:
 Head of Onyxia gives  Victory for the Alliance which leads to  Celebrating Good Times.

Rewards are:
 Onyxia Blood Talisman
 Dragonslayer's Signet
 Onyxia Tooth Pendant

You'll only be able to select one of the rewards, so make sure you pick carefully."

7981,1200 Tickets - Amulet of the Darkmoon,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7981,"If you're the industrious melee type, and you're not in a raid guild, Darkmoon Faire offers one of the best neck pieces available to you with this item. You will have to work to get the 1200 tickets to get the item. I have found that farming rugged leather and making rugged armor kits was a fast way to get tickets.

Here is a breakdown:

8 rugged armor kits = 20 tickets.
You'll need 480 rugged armor kits to get the required 1200 tickets. It is completely obtainable with some work, and it is a great reward for the effort. | Subject: ""All you need to know""
Rugged Armor Kits:
2400 Rugged Leather= 480 Rugged Armor Kits= 1200 Tickets
(Made by Leatherworking)

Thorium Widget's:
1080 Thorium Bar's AND 360 Runecloth= 360 Thorium Widget's =
1200 Ticket's
(Made by Engineer's)

Dense Grinding Stone:
1920 Dense Stone = 480 Dense Grinding Stone = 1200 Ticket's
(Made by Blacksmith's)

These are just the main things I am going to turn in, I didn't want to waste my doing the math for all the other ones. These are the correct Number's, So there is no reason to second guess it.

-Othilo | It depends greatly on your server's economy on which way is cheapest... Typically it's dense stone, but sometimes it's thorium bars.
Here's a quick way to find out how much it's going to cost you per turnin:
Multiply the cost of one stack (20) of each item by the following: 2 for rugged leather, 1.6 for dense stone, and for the widgets, .9 * Thorium Bars + .3 * Runecloth.
Therefore, let's say that on your server, thorium bars cost 3g a stack, runecloth 1g, rugged leather 2g and dense stone 2g.
That means each turn in costs 3g for thorium, 4g for leather, and 3.2g for stone. (for a total of 180g for 1200)
Now you usually will end up using a combination, depending on what is on the AH at any given time, or your own farming skills, but this is a handy tool for those who plan on buying a majority of it."

Yeah, it sucks, you have to do these quests first:

Screecher Spirits
The Prophecy of Mosh'aru
The Ancient Egg
The God Hakkar
The Lost Tablets of Mosh'aru

After that, talk to Ironwhatever in Tanaris and get the quest ""Confront Yeh'kinya"", talk to Yeh'whatever and get the cloak."

Is there a followup to this quest, for which this is a prerequisite?  I didn't do this quest until I was already Exalted with Zandalar Tribe and had finished all the quests from Yojamba Island.  I finished this quest and Molthor didn't offer me any followup, so I'm wondering if it leads to another chain somewhere."

I've found that the heavy leather is very farmable off the Mountain Yetis and Giant Yetis in the Alterac Mountains. Bonuses:

1. They drop money instead of trash items that you have to constantly chuck away.
2. Heavy Leather drop rate is high.
3. Thick concentration.
4. Fast enough respawn.
5. People usually aren't going to bug you.
6. Drops medium leather if it does drop high (about 25% or 33% of the time), so you can combine it up.
7. They are lower level than the Badlands mobs that are good for farming heavy leather from.

I was able to do it as a level 57 hunter without agro'ing them. Rogues may find this easy to do as well, but I am unsure about anyone else who is under my level. Their agro' radiuses are bigger and might agro' Deathclasp by accident.

Good luck. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
Its exactly located where Deathclasp is too.

As a rogue or druid its easy to stealth to the Satchel and take it fast when Deathclasp is out of aggro range.

Guess as class without stealth too, just run to it when Deathclasp walks up the hill. | Subject: ""coords""
at 43, 91 really easy quest | The respawn on this is kinda slow! My guildies and I had to wait through 2 more respawns of Deathclasp before the satchel reappeared. | This quest is relatively simple. The only trick is to opening it without aggroing the elite & two adds. If you follow them up the mountain, just behind their aggro radius, you can open the satchel from max range without any problems. Make sure you shift-click while opening, though, just in case. That way you can open it, then get out of there."

Hive Ashi - Hive entrance at 48,25. Go to the very bottom hive entrance. Turn right. Crystal is in front of you 50,26.

Hive Zora - Hive entrance at 27,66.
Continue down the hive all the way east. This glyph is deep within the hive. The hive terminates in a circular rooms with about 15-20 wasps. The glyph is inside at 36,63

Hive Regal - Enter the Hive at 55,87. Go around the bend and head south. Continue heading south ignoring all forks until you reach the termination of the hive. The glyph is gaurded by 6-7 elites + Natalia at 53,100 | Subject: ""<Blank>""
Ashi is at 50,26
Zora is at 36,63
Regal is at 53,100 | Leads to Unraveling the Mystery (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8314). | Subject: ""A rough guide to the Glyph locations""
Hive'Regal Glyph is in the south west hive entrance, at the end where the level 62 elite Night Elf Priestess is. It's good to do the ""Into the Maw of Madness (Elite)"" quest at the same time.

Hive'Zora Glyph is in the south hive entrance in a similar position to the Hive'Regal Glyph.

Hive'Ashi Glyph is in the eastern entrance. | Subject: ""Kirithra:""
Hive'Zora glyphed crystal location:

Take the cave entrance at the most south-eastern corner of the hive. Once you're in the cave, finding the crystal is simple; follow the cave right through to the eastern most end. The crystal is in the center of the round room filled with non-elite wasps. Easily soloed as a rogue, but I have no idea for other classes.

Once you're standing at the crystal, the aggro range on the wasps isn't large enough for them to see you (they are round the outside of the room), so you won't need your vanish cooldown."
8310,Breaking the Code,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8310,"Subject: ""Silithid Hive Brains""
Regarding the Silithid Hive Brains that drop for this quest; They will not drop straight away most of the time. It will take 5-15 kills approximately, such is the nature of the dreaded random drop. So its better to do this in a sturdy group of 2 or 3, Idealy while doing Glyph Chasing and Into The Maw of Madness. The Brains being a white (Standard Quality) Quest Item everyone in your group will get to loot it.

The Silithid Mobs are tough, but like mentioned above they are not quite as strong as normal 58-60 elites thus apparantly making them soloable for some people although I have not tried this myself as a 60 Orc Warrior.

Thnx for reading my comment and i hope it helped.

Orccheiften 60 Warrior, Kil'Jaeden | Subject: ""<Blank>""
Any of the elite mobs in the three hives will drop brains.  The non elite wasps in Hive'zora will drop these too, but at a rate about 1/2 to 1/3 of the elites.  Easily soloable by a rogue, just ambush, gouge, backstab, pop evasion, and then gouge, backstab, and evicerate your way to victory.  The easiest mobs to go after are the Hive'ashi Stingers, Hive'zora Waywatchers, and the Hive'Regal Slavemakers or Spitfires.  They have a few long spells they try to cast so be sure to kick or gouge them before they can get them off.  Use dual instant poison and be prepared to blind them."

8332,Dukes of the Council,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8332,"Here is how the summons at Silithus windstones work:

The summon has 2 properties: A) Difficulty and B) Elemental Type.

A) Windstone type dictates difficulty of the summon (easy to hard: Templar => Duke => Royal).

You need a full Twilight Trappings set to summon a templar at a lesser windstone.
You need a full Twilight Trappings set +  Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station to summon a duke at a windstone.
You need a full Twilight Trappings set +  Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station +  Twilight Cultist Ring of Lordship to summon a royal at a greater windstone.

B) Crest/Signet/Scepter remove randomness of elemental type of the summon (Air, Earth, Fire, Water). Type of element after crest/signet/scepter controls elemental type of the summon. Without crest/signet/scepter, elemental type of the summon will be random.

Type of item is linked to difficulty level of the summon.
Crest controls => Summon Templar from a lesser windstone in Silithus
Signet controls => Summon Duke from a windstone in Silithus
Scepter controls => Summon Royal from a greater windstone in Silithus
Here is the list of all possible summons and items needed to summon:

TEMPLARS (recommended: 2 man)
Full Twilight Trappings set at lesser windstone = Random templar
Full Twilight Trappings set along with  Crest of Beckoning: Thunder at lesser windstone = Hoary Templar
Full Twilight Trappings set along with  Crest of Beckoning: Stone at lesser windstone = Earthen Templar
Full Twilight Trappings set along with  Crest of Beckoning: Fire at lesser windstone = Crimson Templar
Full Twilight Trappings set along with  Crest of Beckoning: Water at lesser windstone = Azure Templar

DUKES (recommended: 5 man)
Full Twilight Trappings set +  Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station at windstone = Random duke
Full Twilight Trappings set +  Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station along with  Signet of Beckoning: Thunder at windstone = The Duke of Zephyrs
Full Twilight Trappings set +  Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station along with  Signet of Beckoning: Stone at windstone = The Duke of Shards
Full Twilight Trappings set +  Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station along with  Signet of Beckoning: Fire at windstone = The Duke of Cynders
Full Twilight Trappings set +  Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station along with  Signet of Beckoning: Water at windstone = The Duke of Fathoms

ROYALS (recommended: 20+ man)
Full Twilight Trappings set +  Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station +  Twilight Cultist Ring of Lordship at greater windstone = Random royal
Full Twilight Trappings set +  Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station +  Twilight Cultist Ring of Lordship along with  Scepter of Beckoning: Thunder at greater windstone = High Marshal Whirlaxis
Full Twilight Trappings set +  Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station +  Twilight Cultist Ring of Lordship along with  Scepter of Beckoning: Stone at greater windstone = Baron Kazum
Full Twilight Trappings set +  Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station +  Twilight Cultist Ring of Lordship along with  Scepter of Beckoning: Fire at greater windstone = Prince Skaldrenox
Full Twilight Trappings set +  Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station +  Twilight Cultist Ring of Lordship along with  Scepter of Beckoning: Water at greater windstone = Lord Skwol

1. The Templars:
In Silithus kill Twilight Cultist people in their camps and collect a full set of Twilight Trappings ( https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=52000 ), which consists of Mantle, Cowl and Robe! When you have a full set, go to one of the two Lesser Wind Stones around the Twilight Cultist camps. Put the Twilight set on and rightclick the Lesser Wind Stone.
Now you can spawn a random one of the four Templars (Azure Templar, Crimson Templar, Earthen Templar, Hoary Templar) and kill him. (He is soloable, but maybe you'll need to get one friend to kill him.
When you have killed the Templar, loot him and you will get an Abyssal Crest and maybe some green BoE item and if you're really lucky a blue BoP. Search for the name of each Templar on Thottbot or Allakhazam to find out which one drops which BoP item. Bring the Abyssal Crest to Bor Wildmane in Cenarion Hold and you will get a Bag of Spoils ( Bag of Spoils content: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=52026 ) and 90 Silver. This quest is not repeatable.

2. The Dukes:
For the next steps you will need at least a Friendly reputation with the Cenarion Circle.
Get the Aurel Goldleaf quest from Huum Wildmane and go talk to Aurel Goldleaf. For the following quest you will need another 3 Abyssal Crests from Templars and 1 Large Brilliant Shard. Collect those 4 items and give them to Aurel Goldleaf. Now you will receive a Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station. You will need it and another set of Twilight Trappings to spawn one of the Dukes (Duke of Cynders, Duke of Fathoms, Duke of Shards, Duke of Zephyrs) at a Wind Stone (a normal one, not lesser, not greater). For these bosses you will need a good group of 5-7 people. The Dukes drop an Abyssal Signet, which you can give to Bor Wildmane to get 1.85 Gold and a Sack of Spoils ( https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=52153 for content ). The Dukes also drop other nice stuff such as blue BoE pants and other blue items.

--Everything below this line is unconfirmed, since i haven't got that far yet--

3. The Bosses:
For the next steps you will need at least an Honored or Revered reputation with the Cenarion Circle.
Get the quest Goldleaf's Discovery from Huum Wildmane and go talk to Aurel Goldleaf. Then you will need another 3 Abyssal Signets from Dukes and 5 Large Brilliant Shards. Collect those items and give them to Aurel Goldleaf. Now you will receive a Twilight Cultist Ring of Lordship. You will need it plus a Twilight Trappings set plus a Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station to spawn one of the big bosses (Baron Kazum, High Marshal Whirlaxis, Lord Skwol, Prince Skaldrenox) at a Greater Wind Stone. For the big bosses you will need a group of 25-40 people. The bosses drop an Abyssal Scepter and epic stuff.  Again, give the Abyssal Scepter to Bor or Humm Wildmane to get a Chest of Spoils (content: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=52296 ) and 2.8 Gold.

farmed 34 dukes today with the same group..
we had: 2 mages, 1 warrior, 1 rogue, 1 warlock, 1 druid and me (paladin), all lvl 60

its not fun to have to farm sets with ur group because it might take long. So my trick is to buy the sets on AH (2g for each piece) then get alot of crests, transform them into the medallions, and buy more sets. Each group member was able to summon 3 when we joined each other.

once u kill some, u get the hang of it.. dont worry!

we each took turns to summon, then warrior tanked, when the Duke was at 95% rogue joined fight, and the casters just did their thing while druid and me healed.
It worked well, until druid left and i waisted a set and medallion by summoning and dying..

do NOT summon if u are not 100% sure that u will succeed! its just waist of grinding hours..

after u have killed the duke, just move on to the next camp and kill the duke there.. with an epic mount it wont take long to travel..

Drops were awsome, they dropped a rare item 30/34 times.. even one epic.. rare drops were Darkstone Claymore, Abyssal Pants (sells for 120-180g) and some others..

There are different types of Dukes..
The easiest is Duke of Shards (huge golem, only has one AoE attack that stuns u)
Second is Duke of Cynders (Lucifron wannabee with a fire AoE attack)
Third is Duke of Fathoms (a hydra that hits hard)
Hardest is Duke of Zephyrs! (flying serpent, with a very nasty lightning AoE attack.. nearly everyone wiped because of his AoE!)

loot rules were: everyone pass on signet exept the summoner, greed on BoE (need if u need) and pass/roll if need or FFA on BoP.. those rules worked very well, and we only had a few problems because someone rolled need instead of greed..

Grind with guildies! its not fun if u need a thing and it gets ninjaed by a stranger!

if u have a good group like i had, its more fun than MC!"

Summoning the Lesser Wind Stones requires the full set of Twilight Gear (Mantle, Cowl, Robe) and at least friendly faction with Cenarion Cirlce. The Stones are located at three of the camps, two in each camp. The loc of the 3 camps are: (39,44) (26,33) (18,84).

The mobs at these 3 camps give 1 faction point until half way through friendly if I recall. The Abyssal elementals from the Lesser Wind Stones give 5 faction up until half way through honored.

There are 4 types of elements that can be summoned randomly from any of the 6 Lesser wind stones. Air, Fire, Water, and Earth/Rock. They all do MAGIC based damage, so armor doesn't help here. Fire is Immune to Fire based, Water is Immune to Frost based ect... Though all can do a nature based root spell. Some can do an Earth shock that will cancel a spell, also it does damage (like Shaman spell). They are all soloable mobs with experienced players or easier with some perfessions, though suggested duo so you don't waste your twilight set which you lose on summoning. If everyone that is in combat with the mob dies, or goes out of range, the mob disappears and the Lesser Wind Stone is gone until respawn. As a frost mage, all are easy solo's except the Water based mob, which is Immune to frost, though constant arcane missiles with ice barrier and cold snap does the trick.

The first turn in is only 1 Abyssal Crest which is always given by the Lesser Wind Stone kills. The second Turn in requires 3. Both of these give 50 faction points even with revered faction.

This goes for all the rest of the quests with this particular NPC, all the way through even the Abyssal Scepter. First turn in requires 1, the rest require 3.

Good luck, I hope this explains anything that hasn't been posted. | In order to summon an Abyssal Templar you need to collect a complete Twilight Cultist armor set. Once you do, you should be able to summon the necessary templar at one of the lesser stones found by the Twilight Cultist camps when you wear the items. The Templar doesn't aggro right away when you summon it, so you should be able to switch back to your normal armor before starting the fight.

A complete Twilight Cultist set of armor consists of a cowl, mantle, and robes. All of these items have a chance of dropping off the various Twilight Cultists at the camps, although the mantle (shoulder pieces) seem to have a lower drop rate than the other two pieces.

Because the Twilight Cultists armor do not bind when picked up, you can usually find them on the Auction House in abundance."

8363,Abyssal Signets,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8363,"Here is how the summons at Silithus windstones work:

The summon has 2 properties: A) Difficulty and B) Elemental Type.

A) Windstone type dictates difficulty of the summon (easy to hard: Templar => Duke => Royal).

You need a full Twilight Trappings set to summon a templar at a lesser windstone.
You need a full Twilight Trappings set +  Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station to summon a duke at a windstone.
You need a full Twilight Trappings set +  Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station +  Twilight Cultist Ring of Lordship to summon a royal at a greater windstone.

B) Crest/Signet/Scepter remove randomness of elemental type of the summon (Air, Earth, Fire, Water). Type of element after crest/signet/scepter controls elemental type of the summon. Without crest/signet/scepter, elemental type of the summon will be random.

Type of item is linked to difficulty level of the summon.
Crest controls => Summon Templar from a lesser windstone in Silithus
Signet controls => Summon Duke from a windstone in Silithus
Scepter controls => Summon Royal from a greater windstone in Silithus
Here is the list of all possible summons and items needed to summon:

""Feathers for Grazle"" is a repeatable quest, although Grazle does not appear to have the blue Question Mark above his head. | These mobs are heavily farmed, I suggest finding off peak times to grind them.

How to kill them:
1-find a necronic shard (near the flying necropolis)
2-kill LOTS of undeads: this will damage the shard
3-when the shard will have 0 HP, 4 summoner will happear to repair it
4-use 8 Necronic runes to stop the ritual of one of the summoners: this will evoke the Shadow
5-kill the shadow
Tip: As all the mobs, u must be the first one attacking the shadow to complete the quest. So gather a grp of 5 ppl and kill it: prolly the place will be full of players but u and they cant share the killing of a shadow of doom. If u are alone prolly some1 will attack the shadow before u..."

Bone Fragments are used for a quest in EPL called ""Bonescythe Digs"". After you collected 30 Bone Fragments you turn them in for a Insignia of the Crusade.

The Bone Fragments drops off Undeads in Scholomance, Stratholme and all over WPL/EPL.

The quest itself requires Friendly reputation with Argent Dawn to get. | Subject: ""Bone drops""
These drop of SKELETON type undead only - Not off spectres/horrors/flayers and the like.

A good place to farm for them is Andoral in WPL, since there is a large number of lower lvl skeletons there, which respawn quite quickly.

Oh, and the semi bosses (55-56 elite) that appear inside the towers in Andoral will drop 2-3 bone fragments each.

I am yet to find out if this quest is repeatable...

... but will know soon. | Subject: ""Requirements""
You must be level 55 to get this quest.
You must be FRIENDLY with Argent Dawn to get this quest.

You must meet BOTH qualifiers to get this quest and the others like it."

Once you are friendly these rep quests become available. I was nuetral and just hit friendly so went to see if I could finally do the turnins, and behold I could.

These two give ""Insignia of the Dawn"" reward -
30 dark iron scraps (Korfax, Champion of the Light)
30 Core of Elements (Archmage Angela Dosantos)

These two give ""Insignia of the Crusade"" reward -
30 Bone Fragments (Rohan the Assassin)
30 Crypt Fiend Parts (Huntsman Leopold)

All 4 are found in the chapel.

Also, Rayne, just outside the chapel, accepts 30 Savage Fronds, and you choose either one of the above rewards.

They are turned in for other AD ""epics"" such as the epic neck ""Amulet of the Dawn"" | Just a quick correction to Kelar's post..
Light's Hope Chapel is located in Eastern Plaguelands :)

The Insignia's you get from this quest can be used to get a few items if you gather enough ""Insignia of the Dawn"" and ""Insignia of the Crusade"".. There are a 18 Slot bag amongst other things.

The higher reputation with Argent Dawn, the less amount of Insignia's are needed.

There are both blue and epic rewards..
I recommend that you become atleast revered with AD before getting the rewards as you need 20 of each Insignia at Honored, and only 7 of each at Revered.. And becomming Revered isnt all that hard :)

Hope it helps. | Turn these in to Korfax inside the Chapel. Run BRD loads, ninja the scraps, and turn them in at Light's Hope Chapel for decent Argent Dawn reputation. The first turn in is by far the best, in terms of rewards in rep and exp. However, it's a ready reputation grind and useful if you plan on running Naxx. (You must be friendly to complete the quest... I think.) | Need to be at least friendly with the Argent Dawn, before being granted access to these turn in quests. | Subject: ""Blackrock Orcs""
So here is what I know about this.

The following drop the Dark Iron Scraps

Blackrock Sorcerers pretty much drop between 2 to 5 of these at a time.
The BlackRock Soldiers didnt drop as many but they dropped, about 1 or 2 each time I killed em.

These are the primary NPCs which dropped these in Burning Steppes, Coord 42,53

Ok, this Craftsman's Writ takes 160 runecloth, 16 Ironweb Spider Silk, 32 Rugged Leather, and 8 Rune Thread.

just to explain the math:

8 Runecloth Boots X 4 bolt of runecloth per boot X 5 runecloth per bolt = 160

8 Runecloth Boots X 2 Ironweb Spider Silk per boot = 16

8 Runecloth Boots X 4 Rugged Leather per boot = 32

(and just to be thorough)

8 Runecloth Boots X 1 Rune Thread per boot= 8

so, in short, you need:
160 runecloth
16  Ironweb Spider Silk
32  Rugged Leather
8  Rune Thread"

to make enough robes for this quest, you need no less than 200 Runecloth

just so no one bothers to say ""no way thats right"" here is the math

8 Runecloth Robe times 5 Bolt of Runecloth X 5 Runecloth per bolt = 200

of course, you also need 8 Ironweb Spider Silk and 8 Rune Thread, 1 of each of those two items for each Runecloth Robe

so altogether, thats 200 Runecloth, 8 Ironweb Spider Silk, and 8 Rune Thread to gather for this Craftsman's Writ, and you will also need a tailor to make the robes. they will need at least 260 skill in tailoring, and if they do have the skill but not the pattern, then look for Darnall in the Moonglade, in Nighthaven, the local town, and yes, it is neutral.

9221,Superior Armaments of Battle - Friend of the Dawn,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=9221,"Subject: ""Do the Math""
Do I have this correct? In the case of Rugged Armor Kits, I can submit 25 (125 rugged leather = approximately 165 kills) kits to get either 1 Dawn Insignia or 1 Crusade Insignia. 60 Crusade/Dawn Insignias (7500 rugged leather or approximately 9900 kills) get me ""Friend of the Dawn,"" where I can buy an 18-slot bag, a decent leather helm or an underpowered dagger with OK stats.

At an average of 1 minute per kill (not including time & travel overhead), that would be approximately 165 hours (almost a week) of killing whatever had the best rugged leather yield (WS Yetis?).

I'm not sure I could maintain my level of enthusiasm for the game (not to mention not wanting to ever see another yeti again) long enough to finish this. Is this what is really intended or are we just providing a mechanism for farmers?"

9223,Superior Armaments of Battle - Honored Amongst the Dawn,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=9223,"Subject: "":-)""
The WoW website actually has more information on getting these items, and yes the quests are repeatable.

http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/factions/argent/index.html

Enjoy | Subject: ""Get revared!""
If you really want some of these rewards I think you should get revared with the argent dawn!

To get revared easely, farm from lvl 50-55 at least. (Try to not complete any quests until you are honored)this will help you get revared really fast by complete them when you are honored and wont be given any rep with the Argent Dawn anymore by killing.

The reason why I think you should do this is because you need 20 of each mark as honored and only 7 when revared. Now you may think ""How the hell am I supposed to manage that!"" but the fact is that you gain lots and lots of money/rep/exp when farming skeletal flayers, sorcerer and slavering ghouls.

I missed the chance of being revared so I had to buy all the Bone Fragments, Savage Fronds, Dark Iron Scraps, Core of Elements at AH for a huge amount of money. I layed down over 100 gold to get that Supply Bag!When I already spend over 60 gold I realised I only had to buy an 18 slot bag at AH for 50 gold.

So if you got the time and the will you can have an 18 slot bag for free if you get revared!

Good luck! :)"

9228,Epic Armaments of Battle - Exalted Amongst the Dawn,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=9228,"Subject: ""really not worth the efforts.""
Unless your an Ebay gold buyer, and can afford thousand's of gold to AH the stuff to get the insignia's, its really not worth the time or efforts.

IMO, these epics were added, so ""casuals"" players can get there hands on epics. But seriously, if your a casual player, this would take you months to get. The average player, according to what people say on forums, and others in-game, says it take roughly 1 hour (to grind, not an instance run), to collect enough for 1 hand in for the insignias. at exalted you need 27 of each thats 54, thats about 54 hours of play time. Not to mention, how many casual has the ""TIME"" to get to exalted? not to mention revered. So for a casual thats up to 80 hours+ of play time to get enough for 1 epic.

And if your not a Casual player, you should be in a guild that's raiding, If not close to raiding, And these Epics aint that good.there are better blues/Epics inside ZG. And it would take less time to get aswell. If your not in an end-game raiding guild, these might look tempting, but instead of wasting your time running 5-man/10-man instances, use the time to look for a guild.

The only thing thats actually worth getting is the 18 slot bag.

well yeh thats my opinion, If you think the epics are worth it, then go ahead. but imo, this isnt worth the time nor efforts.

unless your an Ebay gold buyer, then thats a different story."

Obtain the red glow at ANY of the various geysers in Silithus, DO NOT take it back to Cenarion Hold, or Bronzebeard encampment as the maps are showing on this quest.

The correct turn in point of the transporter is on the Big Red icon when u push M (map).  Unfortunatly i spent ~20 minutes or more running around Silithus.

Note:  DO NOT MOUNT ... u lose the red glow.
You are able to cast all other spells...not sure if u lose red glow by hearthing or getting summoned."

9664,Establishing New Outposts,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=9664,"Subject: ""Stealth""
Stealth stops the timer. | Subject: ""Re: Establishing New Outposts [9664]""
FOR THOSE WHO ARE ROGUES- you cannot capture the tower if you are in stealth! | Subject: ""How Towers Are Captured""
Go to the tower controlled by the Horde. You must be /pvp and wait 5 minutes before you officially capture the tower. Stay inside the tower, at least that is my suggestion and how I did it. I soloed these and it was quite easy. IF Alliance does not own all the towers, and you capture one, a spetral griffon master appears when the tower is captured and you can take a spectral griffon to the tower of your choice. All I did was go inside, /pvp and a bar appears that shows you the progress of the capture, and it takes 5 minutes of waiting for it to be captured. Then I /pvp again to toggle it off and waited 5 minutes for my pvp flag to drop. Pretty easy if you ask me, especially during the early morning hours when hardly anyone is on and defending. I would imagine it's the same for the Horde because I saw their griffon master also in front of the tower before I captured it. He disappears when you /pvp and wait the alloted time. | Subject: ""Capture the Towers""
You must be pvp flagged in order to capture a tower.  You cannot get credit for capture unless it was neutral or controlled by opposing faction.  A progress bar will appear.  EPL map shows the four towers  and who controls them.

Argent Dawn | You can't accomplish this while stealthed :| | Subject: ""Re: Establishing New Outposts [9664]""
When you capture the first tower, the Eastwall tower, a group of level 60 spectral soldiers appears to escort you to the Northpass tower. When you capture the Northpass tower you get ""the blessing of Lordaeron"" or whatever the horde one is, 5% bonus to life for 30 minutes. At the Plaguewood tower, a spectral griffon master appears and takes you to the tower of your choice, which should be the Crown Guard tower at this point. Nothing special seemed to happen at the Crown Guard tower. | Subject: ""lol""
this quest is great! all u do is ist in a tower for 5 min while flagged. nobody really cares if u capture the tower so its a win win. ez quest | Subject: ""for quest credit, must be other faction owned.""
You get no credit if its neutral or owned by your faction, wait till the oposing faction takes it then take it yourself, only way it gave me any credit for the quest objectives. | Subject: ""Re: Establishing New Outposts [9664]""
  Everybody should be aware that there's a 50/50 chance that the tower-control slider [if Horde controlled] may be at it's max, either way, expect to be at each tower for quite awhile. The slider moves somewhere in the area of one increment per minute and each increment is so miniscule.

  Those curious about Honor Points, I unfortunately netted a whole 18 points per tower captured [Level 62 Human Warrior]. | Subject: ""pvp""
For those of us who haven't done pvp before, can someone please explain how this works? Do the towers need to occupied by the opposing faction to be able to capture them?

Cheers | Subject: ""If tower is alliance and so are you...""
If the tower is already part of your faction you need only go inside and /pvp yourself.  A bar will show up, wait the alotted time and the tower is yours."
9665,Bolstering Our Defenses,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=9665,"Subject: ""Capturing Towers""
Put your pvp on and sit in the tower until its taken. | Subject: ""About the towers..""
A: You have to stand inside the tower, or very close to tower.
B: You must have PVP enabled if you're in non-pvp server.
C: There is an line that shows on right corner of your screen, it shows how much you need to capture tower. Once it is in your faction's colour, you have captured it.
D: Multiple people capture towers faster than just one. | To capture a tower you have to wait inside it until it's captured. You will see a slider bar appear showing the progress toward capture. | Subject: ""Capturing""
I just captured a neutral tower and didn't get credit for it in the quest log.  Does it have to be enemy controlled? | If you capture a tower and an tower of the alliance is nearby, 5 guards will spawn, mount up with like 40% extra speed and will run to the next tower, follow them, they will guard you while you are capturing the tower. If you captured it, you will gain 18 honor + a grave stone will appear, click on it and you'll get Lordaeron's Blessing, wich will give 5% extra health in Eastern Plaguelands, Scholomance and Stratholme. You get 1% extra damage against undead for each tower, if the horde/alliance controls all 4 towers you/they will gain 5% extra damage, wich is a bonus of 1%. This effect is passive, and will just come back when u ressurect. The Blessing won't last through death. You gain 560xp for discovering the towers aswell. | Subject: ""To Capture Tower""
Sit in tower until it tells you it is captured."
