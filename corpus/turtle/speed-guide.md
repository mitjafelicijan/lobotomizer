I used TitanSpeed to determine the speed of different types of gear and travel forms that modify things. This is a WIP. I am going to try to limit this as much as possible to turtle items and speed effects. However there are some items in classic that appear on this list. Another important thing to add here is that the titanspeed that it gives does not reflect what is happening in game and you must half the value given to you to get the correct value. All of these values are calibrated with normal running speed. So make sure you don't have any minor speed to boots equipped when making the calibration on titanspeed.

Ground Mounted Speed

All mounts in turtle wow have dynamic speed, the speed will adapt along with your riding skill. Below is a chart of how turtle handles the dynamic speed.

Every time you get on a ground mount without Riding skill the speed will scale with your level with the formula (Your Level * 0.5%). Example at level 30 you will have 15% mounted speed. The earliest mount you can get in turtle is the turtle mount listed here at level 18 you can start this quest.

Plainsrunning is a different story I still need a tauren to test for the speed percentage with Titanspeed. Rumors are that plainsrunning doesn't gain any speed benefit from mount speed items

Mounted Speed effects can be stacked just like in classic but there are 2 options in turtle that are upgrades or for a new slot of gear.
Enchant: Formula: Enchant Gloves - Riding Skill --> increases mount speed by 2%
Trinket Slot: Carrot on a Stick --> increases mount speed by 3%
Trinket Slot: Whip of Encouragement --> increases mount speed by 3%
Trinket Slot: Goblin Car Key --> increases mount speed by 3%
Trinket Slot: Gnome Car Key --> increases mount speed by 3%
Blacksmithing Spur: Thorium Spurs --> increases mount speed by 8%
Blacksmithing Spur: Mithril Spurs --> increases mount speed by 4%
Paladin Talent: Pursuit of Justice --> increases mount speed by 8%

Epic Riding Gear %: 116%

Swim Speed

The turtle mount can be used to increase ur base speed in water by 15%. Tested with Titanspeed. I always heard that the speed increase was 10% but this is not correct.

Swim gear can be stacked in turtle. Below is the gear that is available to use together.
Chest Slot: Captain's Overcoat --> increases swim speed by 15%
Waist Slot: Azure Silk Belt --> increases swim speed by 15%
Foot Slot: Deep Striders --> increases swim speed by 15%
Trinket Slot: Ice Pearl of Kaneq'nuun --> increases swim speed by 15%
Trinket Slot: Hook of the Master Angler --> increases swim speed by 25% also gives underwater breathing
Trinket Slot: Rethress Tide Crest --> increases swim speed by 15%
Trinket Slot: Triskelion of Roving Elements --> increases swim speed by 8%
Potion: Swim Speed Potion
 --> increases swim speed by 100% for 20s (2min CD)

I am setting my base speed in water with no swimming gear to 100% then putting on all gear from swimming. That gives me 105% speed increase in water. Factoring in the fact that by going in the water you reduce swim speed by -33% that would be a 72% increase speed in water with all gear and turtle mounted speed.
Swim Gear and Turtle Mounted Speed in Water %: 72%

Wyvern/Gryphon Flying Mounts

These mounts can be controlled and lasts for 45 seconds. An addon to track this turtle specific feature is listed here called FlyerTimer. This addon is dependent on BigWigs.

Swim gear modifies flying mount speed. I set my epic mount speed on titan speed to calibrate the titanspeed. This will eliminate the need to do the math when calibrating with running speed. The below values are what I got as a result.

Normal Speed %: 236%
Swim Speed Gear %: 266%

Running Speed

Night elves get 1% movement speed buff. This changed in the turtle class changes that happened in 1.17.2

Running speed doesn't stack together!!!
Unlike other similar movement speed increasing effects, the movement speed granted by night elves racial additively stacks with other movement speed increasing effects. Night elf racial increases movement speed by 1%.

Max Running Speed %: 110%
Back Peddle Speed %: 64.3%

Spell: Emerald Blessing
 --> increases speed by 10% for all raid members within 80 yards.
Enchant: Enchant Boots - Minor Speed --> Increases speed by 8%
Foot Slot: Swift Boots --> Increases speed by 40% for 15s (1 hour CD)
Potion: Swiftness Potion --> Increases run speed by 50% for 15s. (2min CD)
Potion: Swiftness of Zanza --> Increases run speed by 20% for 2 hours. (3s CD)
Weapon Slot: Runeblade of Baron Rivendare --> Increases speed by 8%
Foot Slot: Lynxstep Boots --> Increases speed by 3%
Trinket Slot: Triskelion of Roving Elements --> increases speed by 8%
