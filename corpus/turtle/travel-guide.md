A lot of people were asking me about which boat went to which place and I decided to make a minimap helper for the Darkshore map because there are 3 boats that come from the same place. Below is a picture to aid you in deciding which boat to get on.

An addon I recommend for tracking flight paths for you would be pfquest. When you type in /db taxi [faction] it will show you all available flight paths for that faction.

Flying Mounts

These mounts you can control and last for 45s the mounted speed is at 372%. Most mounts are cross faction and located in guild bases. Only 2 mounts are faction specific and are on horde/alliance respectively. An addon to track how long the mount lasts is listed here. This addon requires that you use BigWigs.

Horde = Red Skies of Durotar will lead you to being able to mount this flying mount when you feed them a Mutton Chop that can be bought from the butcher next to the inn.

Alliance = Matter of Trust will lead you to being able to mount this flying mount when you feed them a Dwarven Mild that can be bought from the Bartender inside the inn.

I have also made a guide analyzing the speed of the flying mounts listed here
