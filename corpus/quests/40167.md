Title: The Tower of Lapidis V
Description: With the key enchanted, one piece of the puzzle has been put into place. I however, do not possess the skillset able to give this key an attunement of that who created it. The power that once attuned this key is incredibly potent and complex, and will need someone of greater skill than I to do this. You may return the key to Hydromancer Flakereef, perhaps he may know of another.
Objective: Return the Enchanted Brass Key to Hydromancer Flakereef.
