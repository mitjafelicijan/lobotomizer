Title: The Harvest Golem Mystery
Description: Here you have it. The Harvester Blueprint. The goblin, who sold it to me... I wish I never see his green face again! Bah!$B$BI looked into these blueprints. I don't know for what Hewen needs it, but it is nothing good, I tell you! This is a machine of death and destruction! I am only giving you this, because he is my old friend and I... hope he still has some brain left in his greedy head.
Objective: Bring the Harvester Blueprint back to Christopher Hewen at Sentinel Hill in Westfall.
