Title: Sleep Paralysis
Description: Excuse me, $c!$B$B<The lady seems to force a smile, but her eyes betray a deep fury.>$B$BYou look the gallant sort, the sort to help a poor damsel, yes? I find myself in need of some rather... odd substances. They may even be dangerous to acquire, but looking at you â€“ I think you can certainly handle it. I will even pay some decent coin for your troubles!$B$BI need some poison. But not just any poison. There are spiders in a cave somewhere East of here, that have a very painful bite, even causing brief paralysis. If you could collect for me a few vials of their venom, I would be eternally grateful! Surely you aren't afraid of a few little arachnids, no?$B$BAnd what do you mean, why? Are you truly asking a lady her personal business?
Objective: Acquire five Leech Stalker Venom samples for Rose Dolohov.
