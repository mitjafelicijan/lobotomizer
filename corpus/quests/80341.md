Title: Taming the Beast
Description: Haha! My, that boar sure is a BIG one, isn't it? I bet you'd like something more suited to a gnome, though. How about a quick-thinking, majestic Snow Leopard?$B$BYou can find them to both the south and east of here. I've recharged your G.N.O.E.M.R. Taming Rod, so you're ready to go out there and catch a cat!$B$BWatch out, though. They're far more feisty than that boar! Don't underestimate them or you might end up as kitty kibble!
Objective: Use the Taming Rod to tame a Snow Leopard. Practice your skills, then return the Taming Rod to Clover Spinpistol in Kharanos.
