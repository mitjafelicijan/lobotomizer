Title: Drowned Love
Description: Greetings! You're a long way from home! Are you looking for me?$B$BI'm Selendra. I'm desperately trying to right the wrongs of the past here in Mashan'she! You do know that is this place's name, yes? Not Desolace, no! That's a horrible name for it, just because the life has been sucked out and... never mind.$B$BLook, there are signs of life, I'm sure of it. I just need someone to help prove it, convince the world that this land is still worth saving, for the flora and fauna that can still survive!$B$BI would like to see how far the life-leeching has gone. Theradras may have stripped life from the land, but what about the seas? $B$BThe Kal'dorei ruins of Ethel Rethor are mostly underwater now. But there used to be beautiful blooms of Alor'el, the lovers' leaf, which grew there. They can survive underwater though, $r! This is known! Please, search the sunken depths and bring me back some of those flowers as proof, if they still exist.
Objective: Search the sunken elven ruins of Ethel Rethor for any living flowers to return to Selendra.
