Title: Vernon's Task
Description: Greetings, $N.$B$BIt is rare that I admit my incorrect assumptions, but I must atone for this one. I previously thought the ogres of Brol'ok should be allowed to grow and fester, like a pustulant sore, right next to Ravenshire. Let the living there be the ones to suffer with it.$B$BBut alas, whatever still holds vigil over this godforsaken land has a sense of irony. It was just last night that I saw a group of ogres attack, and kill, one of our own Deathstalkers. Out of my own pocket, I now purchase vengeance. Bring me twenty of their heads, and be rewarded.
Objective: Bring 20 Brol'ok ogre heads to Deathstalker Vernon at Stillward Church in Gilneas.
