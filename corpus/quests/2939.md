Title: In Search of Knowledge
Description: While the ruins of Feralas can be quite dangerous, they have much to tell of what has happened here.$B$BSearching through the rubble to the south a few days ago, I discovered what appears to be a normal stave. However, I just can't shake the feeling that there is something more to it. Angelas and I have been poring over our books here, but we can't find a thing about it.$B$BI have a colleague in Darnassus that may be able to tell us what this is, $N. Why don't you go talk to her and see if she can help us?
Objective: Talk to Daryn Lightwind in Rut'theran Village.
