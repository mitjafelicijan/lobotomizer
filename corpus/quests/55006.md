Title: Backup Capacitor
Description: That was almost a disaster. We ran out of oil and almost used all of the power from the thunder lizard scales. What do you mean just work without power?$B$BPal, most things here don't have a failsafe when the tap runs dry. Some things don't even have an off button!$B$BThis town is a ticking timebomb. It'll blow up sky high if the oil platform is destroyed or overrun again, and I plan to have a backup plan.$B$BYou see, I've heard some whispers that the gnomes invented some sort of capacitor that can power entire rigs for hours without end in an emergency, though I also heard Gnomeregan blew up and got radiated, and the capacitor went missing after that. That explains why nobody got their grubby hands on it yet.$B$BVenture there and see if you have any luck finding it, maybe bring your friends too, who knows what lurks down there.
Objective: Bring the Megaflux Capacitor to Technician Grimzlow.
