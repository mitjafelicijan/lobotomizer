Title: The Other White Mech
Description: If there's one thing I like better than crackin' skulls for profit, it's cookin' up brand-new mechanical marvels. There's a whole butcher's shop of parts out there in those burnt woods, and buddy, my mouth is waterin' for a big old mechanical feast!$B$BI don't know why the other expedition would leave so much behind and I don't care - bring me some of those parts!
Objective: Collect 5 Mechanical Drumsticks from the mechanical chickens and return to Sprat Nozzleton.
