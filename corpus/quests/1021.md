Description: Listen, I don't know who you are, but I need your help. My sisters went to take back the Branch of Cenarius from the satyr. They said they'd be back soon, but it's been two whole days!$B$B$n, you have to find them! They were looking for the ruins of a night elf temple in Xavian to the northeast. I don't know what to think. Look for Anilia, she was leading them on the search.
