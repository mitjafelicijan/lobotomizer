Title: Agmond's Fate
Description: The last report I received from Agmond is troubling, more so now that he's dead!He mentioned that his diggers uncovered "ancient urns" at the dig site outside Uldaman.I fear that the urns he found at that site incited the troggs, just as did the idols I found here.$B$BI need you to get those urns for our studies.Go to the Uldaman site, gather the urns, then return to me.
Objective: Bring 4 Carved Stone Urns to Prospector Ironband in Loch Modan.
