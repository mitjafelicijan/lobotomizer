Title: Into The Jaws
Description: I have certainly not seen this kind of lock for quite a while. And now I can see why House Darlthos surrounded this whole ordeal in secrecy. What we have here is a type of blood magic. Although not as dangerous as some, it certainly requires blood of the family member to activate it. Not many know how to wield this magic; the last mage I knew who used this is long dead! $B$B Melenas used to have a section of his own in a library deep in the Shadowfang Keep. Perhaps there you can find something of use. But beware, that place is overrun by the savage Worgen, so it is better if I hold on to this box until your return. We wouldn't want to lose both you and the box should you fail, right?
Objective: Find Melenas' Belongings in the Shadowfang Keep Library and return them to Pierce Shackleton in the Undercity.
