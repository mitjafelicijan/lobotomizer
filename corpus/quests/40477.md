Title: The Harvest Golem Mystery
Description: I will handle rewiring the golems of Westfall. It will take months, maybe years, but it will be done.$B$BHowever, the Defias can still easily produce new ones faster than I can rewire them. We need to halt the production. Fortunately, I know where we can find the shipments of Animation Runes.$B$BGo to the Jangolode Mine and Gold Coast Quarry. The Defias hide their runes deep inside, awaiting transport to their underground foundry. Bring them to me.$B$BAnd yes, I promised you the rest of the story. So where did we end? The arrival of Defias.$B$BVery soon, they started producing Harvest Golems on their own. How they figured it out- it is a mystery.$B$BI have my suspicions though. To produce such a Rune, a powerful mage is needed. The Defias have mages on their own, but none of them is powerful enough to make it. I think they are working with the person who turned the golems hostile in the first place. Their original creator.$B$BHis identity is still unknown to me. I hope you will find some clues with the shipment.
Objective: Gather the Jangolode Mine Shipment, and the Gold Coast Shipment to Maltimor Gartside at the Gartside Plot in Westfall.
