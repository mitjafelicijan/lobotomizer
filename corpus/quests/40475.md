Title: The Harvest Golem Mystery
Description: Excuse me for my bad manners. I was so excited to lay my hands on those blueprints. Never have I seen these lands in such a sorry state. And it is not only because of the Defias!$B$BYou see, years ago a salesman arrived in Westfall. He brought new commodity - Harvest Golems.$B$BFarmers were overjoyed. Golems worked flawlessly, gathering crops and scaring the wildlife away. So more golems were being purchased. In a few years, they outnumbered the farmers. And then, it happened.$B$BGolems turned on their owners. In a few weeks, almost all farms in Westfall were lost. And to make matters worse, the Defias arrived. It was only natural that the people of Westfall linked the sudden change to the Brotherhood.$B$BI believe that it is a mere coincidence. Someone else manipulated the golems and now the Defias are using the situation to their advantage.$B$BI will continue the story later, $N. For now, I have a request. Go to Moonbrook. The smith had a stash of engineering equipment hidden in his forge. Check there!
Objective: Recover the Old Engineering Tools for Maltimor Gartside at the Gartside Plot in Westfall.
