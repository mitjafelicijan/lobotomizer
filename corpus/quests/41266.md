Title: The Big Man
Description: Look, I'm gonna keep this blunt with you, things are -not- looking good, and the big man is going to need to hear about it. He's already got an idea that we are not doing the best right now, but once he hears this he's gonna blow a gasket.$B$BSo I'm gonna need a little old favor. Why don't you run this report up to Taxxlo Rustgate at the top of the tower here in town, and bring him this report. Make sure you're snappy with it, he doesn't like waiting.
Objective: Bring Ozzick's Report to Taxxlo Rustgate at Rustgate Ridge on Blackstone Island.
