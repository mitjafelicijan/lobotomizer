Title: Goblin Sponsorship
Description: Our racing team is the pride of goblins everywhere. You'd be surprised at some of the people who contribute in one way or another to our team.$b$bYou know Gazlowe? He tracks down parts from around the world for us. He even came down to work on one of our rigs once!$b$bA few weeks ago, he said he'd send us a new prototype fuel regulator but it hasn't come yet. He's usually very prompt... Maybe you wouldn't mind going to Ratchet to ask him about it? I wouldn't be so pushy, but the gnomes are gaining on us!
Objective: Speak to Gazlowe in Ratchet.
