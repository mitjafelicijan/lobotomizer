Title: Love, No Matter What
Description: I lost everything when Arthas cameâ€”my wealth, my influence, my home. However, amidst the ruins, I discovered something new: love. If not for Lin and her unwavering support, I'm uncertain how I would have coped with this disaster.$B$BI wish to express my gratitude to her, but I'm at a loss on how to do so. I've never excelled in matters of sentiment. It might sound peculiar, but perhaps a fox fur would complement her beautiful hair. I've heard that foxes inhabit the Autumn Isle to the west. If you could obtain their fur and bring it to Vanudal Goldweaver, he could craft a stunning stole...
Objective: Bring a Fox Fur to Vanudal Goldwever in Alah'Thalas.
