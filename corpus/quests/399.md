Title: Humble Beginnings
Description: It seems an eternity since I was a boy working the farm in Westfall. They say you can never go back, and it's true. Doubly true in my case, my family's home has been burned down and taken over by thieves.$b$bI have spoken with my father about the fate of some of my possessions, including my first compass. He was unable to save them. However, he also says that they should be hidden away on the farm.$b$bYou'll find the Alexston Farmstead west of Sentinel Hill. Perhaps you could go and retrieve it for me?
Objective: Go to Baros Alexston's house in Westfall and search for his compass, then return it to him in Cathedral Square of Stormwind.
