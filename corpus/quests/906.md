Title: Betrayal from Within
Description: Take Lok's head to Thork in the Crossroads, $r. <snort> He should know what has happened to my tribe without any words--ha, not that he would believe Mangletooth helped in <snort> such things. But I am sure he'll reward you for carrying out such a great deed. <snort>$B$BI will continue to bless you with Agamaggan's power for as long as I remain in this cage, $r. Until then, farewell.
Objective: Bring Lok's Skull to Thork at the Crossroads in the Barrens.
