Title: The Horde Needs Peacebloom!
Description: It is said that every generation must face a defining trial. I fear the Ahn'Qiraj War will be the crucible in which our mettle is tested. So we prepare, and in so doing find what we are made of.$B$BI have volunteered to help the Horde by gathering as much peacebloom as possible, so that it can be made into potions for the war. I hope that you are here to lend me your aid. If so, then I need you to bring back to me a good quantity of the herb. Will you assist me, $c?
Objective: Bring 20 Peacebloom to Herbalist Proudfeather at the Valley of Spirits in Orgrimmar.
