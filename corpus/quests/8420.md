Title: Hot and Itchy
Description: Maybe this sounds strange coming from an imp, but I'd like a pet of my own.I really would.It's just not fair that Niby gets me and I get nothing!$b$bIn fact, it doesn't even need to be a living pet.I'd need something to start making it with, like some felcloth.The satyrs here in Felwood sometimes have felcloth, so you'd just have to kill enough of them until you find some.That doesn't sound so bad, does it?
Objective: Bring a piece of felcloth to Impsy in Felwood.
