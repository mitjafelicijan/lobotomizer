Title: Enraged Wildkin
Description: Hey there, $Glad:lass;! I was chased from my camp in southern Winterspring by some bloodthirsty wildkin! Well, I suppose I got too close to something the wildkin were guarding.$B$BI barely managed to get away safely; I fear a buddy of mine wasn't as lucky. Would you mind braving the wildkin and heading to the camp? I really need my supplies, and I'd also like to get back the amulet I unearthed yesterday at the dig site.
Objective: Locate Jaron Stoneshaper's wrecked camp and supplies in southern Winterspring.
