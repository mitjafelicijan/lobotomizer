Title: Knowledge of the Orb of Orahil
Description: Still a fool, and still seeking the trappings of mortals. Yes, I speak to you with arrogance. I see you before me and I laugh. You're pathetic!$B$BBut it matters not what I think. It only matters what those willing to deal with you thinks!And in this case, against my better judgment, those with some portion of power feel you deserve more.$B$BIf this is something you strive for then you should speak with Menara Voidrender in the tower above Ratchet. I believe you have met her before some time ago.
Objective: Speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.
