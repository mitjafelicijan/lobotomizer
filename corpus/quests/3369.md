Title: In Nightmares
Description: This shard holds great secrets; it is the pure essence of the Emerald Dream. However, what I see in this shard is not a dream; one would call this sort of a vision a nightmare.$B$BI do not wish to alarm you, $N, but I think it is best if you deliver this shard into the hands of a wise druid as soon as you can.$B$BHamuul Runetotem on Elder Rise is who you need to find. Head to Thunder Bluff. I cannot say more. 
Objective: Bring the Nightmare Shard to Hamuul Runetotem on Elder Rise.
