I had the chance to learn much of the more nuanced teachings of druidic magic, and it is there I learned to craft an item called 'The Horn of Binding'.$B$BI have been working to craft a new horn and bind it to the natural energies here in Winterspring, but I require more materials from across these lands and Hyjal both.$B$BI require: the beaks of Greathorn Owls native to Hyjal, a Vilemusk Horn from the Satyr that also dwell there, a book titled 'Bracing of Nature' which can be found at Nordanaar, and finally a Moontouched Amulet from the local Owlbeasts here in Winterspring.
Objective: Gather 6 Greathorn Beaks, 1 Vilemusk Horn, the book 'Bracing of Nature', and a Moontouched Amulet to Everwyl Moonseeker at Starfall Village in Winterspring.
