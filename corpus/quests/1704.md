Title: Klockmort Spannerspan
Description: I made a copy of my notes on the techniques I learned while making your armor, and need someone to take them to Klockmort Spannerspan. He's a gnomish blacksmith in the Gnomeregan Reclamation Facility and when he learns what I've learned... I bet he'll pull off his own beard in excitement.
Objective: Bring Furen's Notes to Klockmort Spannerspan.
