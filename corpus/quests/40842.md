Title: The True Enemy
Description: The foul demons dare to challenge us by occupying a stronghold south of Forest Song, in the wretched Demon Fall Canyon.$B$BSadly, the Sentinels stubbornly refuse to lend me aid, while our true enemy grows stronger and prepares for another invasion.$B$BIt is imperative that we take action: I urge you to journey into their territory and thin their numbers. Eliminating at least ten demons of each kind you come across will send a powerful message.$B$BThese fiends must be banished back into the Twisting Nether, never to desecrate our sacred groves again.
Objective: Slay 10 Searing Infernals, 10 Felguards and 10 Mannoroc Lashers for Delos Talonheart at Forest Song in Ashenvale.
