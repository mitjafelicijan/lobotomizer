Title: The Horde Needs More Lean Wolf Steaks!
Description: As you can see, $C, we still need to pack away more food for the soldiers. I don't know if you've ever been in a war before, but once you get past the initial shock of the battlefield, you can get pretty hungry. You did a good job last time, so I expect that you'll do as well, if not a little quicker, in getting me another stack of those lean wolf steaks.
Objective: Bring 20 Lean Wolf Steaks to Bloodguard Rawtar at the Valley of Spirits in Orgrimmar.
