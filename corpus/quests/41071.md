Title: Bearing the Corruption
Description: A bear! What creature in the wilds could match its magnificence and dominance? It is no mere coincidence that our druids have long revered this form, receiving blessings from Ursoc and Ursol themselves.$B$BHowever, it greatly pains me to witness these noble creatures succumbing to the fel corruption that plagues these woods. Despite Ethwyr's selfless sacrifice, it appears that our attempts to heal them have only brought more suffering to these unfortunate beasts.$B$BTherefore, I beseech you: venture into the woods and bring an end to the suffering of the twenty bears who call these lands their home. It will not be an easy task, but do it for the sake of nature.
Objective: Slay 20 Angerclaw Grizzly Bears for Golhine the Hooded in Felwood.
