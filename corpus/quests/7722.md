Title: What the Flux?
Description: When that bastard, Maltorius, left our clan, he left with something more valuable than a pristine arcane crystal: Our recipe for fiery flux! I'd bet anything that the recipe was part of the deal in his new promotion amongst the Dark Irons.$B$BI want you to get our secret plans back, $N. I'm sure they're somewhere near Maltorius, deep inside the Slag Pit.
Objective: Somewhere in the Slag Pit of the Cauldron you will find the Secret Plans: Fiery Flux that Overseer Maltorius stole. Find those plans and return them to Master Smith Burninate in the Searing Gorge.
