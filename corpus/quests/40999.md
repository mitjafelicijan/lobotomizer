Title: Lost and Found
Description: If you desire to truly learn more, I will require some favors before I can depart with what knowledge I can gleam from this parchment of notes. When I first arrived in Karazhan some time ago, I wore an engraved bracelet made of the finest gold. It was a symbol of my status, and has subsequently gone missing ever since I have been left to haunt these halls.$B$BI am certain I left my bracelet somewhere within these lower halls. Recover it for me, and I will be quite thankful.
Objective: Recover the Engraved Golden Bracelet for Duke Rothlen in Karazhan.
