Title: Operation Help Jabbey 2
Description: Well, I hate to do this to you kid, but that dwarf went and... 'used' most of the snuff, looks like you're a bit out of luck. This certainly isn't enough to recover even a fraction of the cost for the parts you're looking for, but I do have another favor, that will pay for the rest of it.$B$BLet's just say I have some clients that are looking to 'research' toxic materials for, scientific, purposes. They are looking to get their hands on a 'Blighted Essence' which can be acquired from the Blighted Horrors in Eastern Plaguelands. So, get me the Blighted Essence, and that will pay off the rest of the parts, easy yeah?
Objective: Venture to Eastern Plaguelands and gather a 'Blighted Essence' from Blighted Horrors for Jabbey at Steamwheedle Port in Tanaris.
