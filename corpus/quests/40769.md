Title: Chillwind Armor
Description: It has been a long time since I worked on anything worthwhile, and let me tell you, I am desperate for some real work. I have been stranded here on Tel'Abim to be nothing more than a glorified repairman now for a while.$B$BMy inner blacksmith calls to me, and I want to work on something unique before I go insane. Long ago when I worked at Everlook I was fascinated with the Chillwind Chimaera, extremely powerful creatures that roamed the snowy tundras.$B$BThere were rumors floating around about rare Frostwoven horns that have been growing on a few of the creatures, I'd like to get my hands on one, and harness it into armor, think you can do that for me? You can find Chillwind Chimaera out in Winterspring, far to the north of here.
Objective: Slay Chillwind Chimaera and collect a Frostwoven Chillwind Horn for Razin Brasslight at Bixxle's Storehouse in Tel'Abim.
