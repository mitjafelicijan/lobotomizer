Title: The Restless Souls
Description: I draw my power - my will to continue living and breathing - from the unmitigated hatred I have for the Scourge and all that they have done. I am, however, no zealot. There are those, like the Scarlet Crusade, who would sooner destroy the innocent undead than lend them even an ounce of compassion.$B$BWhich brings me to this: My blaster. It will unchain the tortured souls from Stratholme.$B$BUse it on the ghosts that haunt the ransacked streets. Free their souls.
Objective: Use Egan's Blaster on the ghostly and spectral citizens of Stratholme. When the restless souls break free from their ghostly shells, use the blaster again - freedom will be theirs!$B$BFree 15 Restless Souls and return to Egan.
