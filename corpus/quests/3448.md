Title: Passing the Burden
Description: I've recently been handed the responsibility of investigating Azshara--a once beautiful area the elves called home. This would be back when they practiced magic. It's now a more dangerous place than it is beautiful, but that doesn't stop us from turning over every stone for answers to our past.$B$BA companion of mine named Tymor offered to help me investigate the area since he takes a particular interest in such things.$B$BHe owns a small place to the right of the Hall of Mysteries here in the city.
Objective: Speak to Tymor in Ironforge.
