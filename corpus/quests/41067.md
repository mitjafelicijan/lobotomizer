Title: Scythe of the Goddess
Description: The name worgen resonates through the echoes of history, evoking memories of ancient times. Eons ago, during the reign of Queen Azshara, her mages delved into forbidden arts, opening portals to realms beyond mortal comprehension.$B$BWorlds of Buring Legion, engulfed by the Emerald Flame, worlds of absolute cold, worlds of inimaginable darkness.$B$BAmong these realms was one known as Vorgendor, world of Blood. The knowledge surrounding it has long faded, concealed in the annals of forgotten lore for good reason.$B$BHowever, in the depths of my ancient wisdom, I can guide you towards a beacon of knowledge. A human mage by the name of Ur dedicated himself to the study of this enigmatic realm. It is said that he penned a tome, a testament to his understanding and exploration of Vorgendor. If the mages of Dalaran are no longer in possession of this invaluable book, I believe it may be found within the expansive library of Lord Nefarius.
Objective: Retrieve a copy of "Vorgendor: Myths from the Blood Dimension" from Lord Victor Nefarius.
