Title: Samophlange
Description: Pulling open the face of the control console reveals a dense jumble of wires, tubing and other strange mechanical objects--most of which seem to serve no practical purpose. Pushing them aside and digging deeper into the console, you find the samophlange. A tug removes it from its housing.
Objective: Return the Samophlange to Sputtervalve in Ratchet.
