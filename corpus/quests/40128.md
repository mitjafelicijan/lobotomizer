Title: An Ancient Acquisition
Description: Greetings. Torble Sparksprocket here. Junior Archaeologist of the Explorer's League! A few weeks ago, the dig found this strange contraption. It appears to be the torso of an automaton, and it is clearly of Titan make, but we haven't seen anything like it before. That's why I was called here.$B$BI quickly realized that it is a modular automaton of some kind. Some days later, the other parts were found, but someone tripped some defense mechanism, and now the dig is full of golems. Can you head in there and find the other pieces? You need two arms, two legs, and a head. Look through crates and such.
Objective: Gather 2 Automaton Legs, 2 Automaton Arms, and an Automaton Head from the Bael'modan Digsite.
