Title: Fall Of The Usurper
Description: With their forces weakened, it is as good as time as any to attack them directly. Before I changed into... this...$B$B<She points at her undead features.>$B$BI was one of the commanders here, before... That's why I know their camp will prove to be a difficult challenge, even while weakened. I recommend that you call for aid when attacking their base. Beware that your primary goal is to end the lives of both Captain Silas, and my usurper sister Faliona too. Do this for me, and I promise that you will be well rewarded.
Objective: Slay Duchess Faliona, Captain Silas, 8 Remnants Footmen and 4 Remnants Priests for Duchess Grelda.
