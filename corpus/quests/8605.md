Title: The Horde Needs More Wool Bandages!
Description: Good to see you again, $C. We are still working on preparations here for the war effort, and I can still use all of the help that you can give in gathering up wool bandaging. Any assistance at all will be greatly appreciated. I only hope that our efforts will be good enough. I've lost too many noble souls on the battlefields of yesterday to not do everything in my power to see to it that doesn't happen again.
Objective: Bring 20 Wool Bandages to Healer Longrunner at the Valley of Spirits in Orgrimmar.
