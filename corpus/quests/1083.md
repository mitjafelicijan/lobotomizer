Title: Enraged Spirits
Description: I'm unsure what the Venture Co. did to the Vale, but it's obvious they were overpowered by the creatures there.$B$BThey set the forest aflame, and used their inventions of destruction to decimate as much of the Vale as possible.$B$BBut in their ignorance they also released something else: burning spirits, elementals of flame, stone and rage.$B$BThe land has no chance to see Elune's smile while these creatures roam free.$B$BBring me their smoldering embers to show you've reduced their numbers.
Objective: Bring 8 Smoldering Embers from any of the fire elementals in the Charred Vale to Kaela Shadowspear in Stonetalon.
