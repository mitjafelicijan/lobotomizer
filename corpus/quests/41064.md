Title: Scythe of the Goddess
Description: You have it in your possession? No, no, no! It's awful, IT should've never been found! The return of the dreaded Dark Riders looms on the horizon, their vengeance seeking to claim my life and unleash ruin upon the entirety of Duskwood!$B$BYet, twisted as it may be, it is still preferable that the Scythe rests in your hands rather than theirs. However, I must confess that my knowledge of this relic is scarce. Although I held it in my grasp for a fleeting moment, I swear upon my fragile existence that I am oblivious to its true nature. I know nothing!$B$BIt was in the desolate depths of the old mine, known as Roland's Doom, that fate thrust the Scythe into my trembling hands. Go there, if you must. But be wary- it's overrun by worgen, or even darker beings.
Objective: Travel to Roland's Doom and find any clues about the Scythe of Elune.
