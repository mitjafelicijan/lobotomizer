Description: Nice work collecting that food recruit, you've done good work, even if you're not apart of our navy. If you're still looking to help out around here, I do have one last thing I need.$B$BYou see, as a Deckmaster, it is my job to secure, and guarentee supplies for the boat, and since we are docked here for some time, I called in a few favors that just need to be picked up.$B$BDown in Ratchet I have an order waiting for a barrel of Gunpowder, grab it for me, it should be tucked away on the left side of the bank there. Lastly, head to Theramore, it is a place that still holds many loyal allies, at the dock, there should be some docked ships, explore them, and find a crate stamped with a green anchor, bring that to me as well.
Objective: Collect the Smuggled Gunpowder from Ratchet and the Smuggled Procurements from Theramore for Deckmaster Darkhollow at Anchor's Edge in the Barrens.
