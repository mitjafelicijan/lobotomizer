Title: Into the Dream III
Description: We will need more materials to attune you to the Dream. Your physical form could become trapped there, and you would surely fall prey to the Nightmare. To ensure your safe passage through the Dreamway, I require the following items: first, a Binding Fragment of Cliffbreaker Giants. This powerful relic will bind your spirit to Azeroth, offering protection in the event of any failures along the way. $B$BNext, an Overloaded Arcane Prism from Dire Maul shall serve as your shield against the magical tempests that permeate the Dream.$B$BAdditionally, acquire a Slumberer's Shard, retrieved from our fallen brethren in the depths of the Sunken Temple. This shard possesses the ability to cloak your presence from the defenders of the Dream.$B$BLastly, seek out a skilled blacksmith who can craft an Arcanite Rod. $B$BOnce you have gathered these items, seek out Itharius, brother of Eranikus, in the Swamp of Sorrows. We need his blessing to grant you access to the Dream, as this decision is not mine to make.
Objective: Gather a Binding Fragment from Cliff Breakers in Azshara, Overloaded Arcane Prism from Arcane Torrents in the Western wing of Dire Maul, Slumberer's Shard from Weaver in the Sunken Temple and an Arcanite Rod. Report to Itharius in the Swamp of Sorrows with the collected items.
