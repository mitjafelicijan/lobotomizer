Title: Eternal Mortality
Description: And so, here we stand, $N. The end of your journey, immortality awaits. But is that truly what you want? To be like those haughty creatures of old, never fearing the cold grip of death? Never feeling the adrenaline rush of living on the edge? The risk that makes life worth living... gone. War, which I can see in your soul you live for, will become lackluster.$B$BYou will live forever. You will watch your family pass away. Your friends. Your loves. And then what? When all you value is gone?$B$BNo, I will spare you this torture, and instead grant you the true blessing: the blessing of mortality. This is the moment you have been waiting for. To face the greatest challenges and know your life may come to an end at any moment. That... that is what truly makes life worth fighting for. Am I not correct, $N?
Objective: Speak to the Mysterious Mailbox again to be mortal forever, or abandon this quest and reap immortality at your 60th level.
