Title: A Pinch of Venom
Description: The Deathstrike Tarantula are a formidable foe out within the swamps that lurk just southeast of Stonard. They can be found creeping about the swamps and laying traps for those they hunt.$B$BIt is from these Tarantula that I ask you to gather their poison. I have been attempting to mix the tang of poison, once nullified, into food. In truth, I do have ulterior motives of attempting make such recipes work.$B$BPerhaps one day I may be a known cook within Orgrimmar, and not stuck to the Sawamp of Sorrow. Travel into the swamp, and collect me 5 Deathstrike Venom!
Objective: Collect 5 Deathstrike Venom for Thultash in Stonard.
