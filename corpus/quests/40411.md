Title: The Good Snuff
Description: Oh, how it is to be docked and not sailing the vast, and boring sea for months on end. All this time to myself and some dry land to stand upon, I just wish I had one thing.$B$BI have a contact out in Steamwheedle Port that has been my hookup for a while now, and if you wouldn't mind picking up a special 'package' for me, it would be much appreciated!$B$BAt the port there is a goblin named Jabbey, he can almost get you anything you need, that is if you have the coin for his 'premium wares' he calls it. Head out there, and pick up a package for 'Groy' he'll know what I'm looking for.
Objective: Pick up the special package and return it to Privateer Groy at Theramore Isle in Dustwallow Marsh.
