Title: Securing the Lines
Description: Gazlowe told me once, "Rezlak. There's one thing you need to know in life, and that's if you want something done well, do it yourself."$b$bI can't deal with losing all our caravans, so I'm just going to take matters into my own hands. Drygulch Ravine lies through the eastern part of Razorwind Canyon. If we kill all the harpies there, the routes will be safe.$b$bOf course, there was one other thing that Gazlowe taught me, and that's "You can get anything done for a price." So, going to help me out, $n?
Objective: Kill 12 Dustwind Savages and 8 Dustwind Storm Witches for Rezlak near Drygulch Ravine.
