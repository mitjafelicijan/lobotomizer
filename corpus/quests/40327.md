Title: Abandoned Equipment
Description: I got word a few weeks back that the Venture Co. had to abandon the Crystalvein Mine because of a basilisk problem. No doubt they left behind all sorts of equipment and tools that are ripe for pilfering. We pirates are usually operating on second hand equipment, and such a score we -cannot- pass up.$B$BThe Crystalvein Mine is located to the east and is just off the road near the Gurubashi Arena. Get there, and get there quick pal, before those Venture goons go and try to get back there stuff. If we act fast, they won't even know we went and snatched it all up!
Objective: Collect Venture Co. Equipment for Falgig Wazzlewrench at the Bloodsail Compound in Stranglethorn Vale.
