Title: Tainted Scroll
Description: Ah, while you were off dealing with the mindless Scourge, this scroll arrived for you. I would think it's some matter of importance as it seems it bears the seal of the warlock trainer Maximillion. I would take some time to read it before heading out again.
Objective: Read the Tainted Scroll and speak to Maximillion in Deathknell.
