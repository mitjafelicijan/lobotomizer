Title: Taming the Beast
Description: I am Clover Spinpistol, Mountaineer and Sniper. We may be good shots, but unfortunately us little folk aren't too suited for close combat. No worries, though! You just need to have a beast take the hits for you!$B$BTinker Town's best and brightest recently made an amazing scientific breakthrough to address our less than stellar record with large animals who find us appetizing and bite-sized.$B$BYou seem like a promising marksman. Just the talent we need in our efforts to retake Gnomeregan! To that end, I'll teach you how to use the patented G.N.O.E.M.R. Taming Rod.$B$BTake this and try to use it on a Large Crag Boar. Make sure it's large!
Objective: Use the Taming Rod to tame a Large Crag Boar. Practice your skills, then return the Taming Rod to Clover Spinpistol in Kharanos.
