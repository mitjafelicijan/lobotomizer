Title: To Kill With Purpose
Description: You kill with purpose while you remain on my stead.$B$BYour first task is to feed my hounds.$B$BTake this mortar and pestle and travel to Corin's Crossing. Once there, you will find a robust selection of Scourge to slaughter. From their fresh carcasses I need living rot. Take that living rot and grind it up in the mortar, then let it sit to coagulate. Bring the coagulated rot back here.$B$BAnd imbecile, realize that living rot from the undead doesn't remain 'living' for very long. You must kill quickly!
Objective: Travel to Corin's Crossing to the east and slaughter the Scourge that inhabit the town. Collect 7 pieces of Living Rot in under 10 minutes. Use the Mortar and Pestle to grind the Living Rot into Coagulated Rot.
