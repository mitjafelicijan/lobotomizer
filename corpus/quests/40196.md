Title: Lykourgos
Description: It has been a long time since our people last saw the sands of Kalimdor. We left our tribe in pursuit of riches, and now, the man who led us here has betrayed us for his own prosperity. The riches we fought and worked so hard to gain were taken, and we were left to rot.$B$BThe one responsible for this betrayal is a centaur named Lykourgos, who orchestrated it with the Southseas Pirates. I had my suspicions about him, but I hadn't expected his honor to be so cheap. Everyone within this camp wants revenge, but we have no means to kill him. I hate to speak anything good of such a snake, but he is undoubtedly a ruthless murderer with great skill in arms.$B$BHe is known as 'The Reaver' due to his brutality, and you should not underestimate him. Find him, kill him, for all of us here, and for his betrayal. I do not know where he is, but he is still a pirate through and through, so he should be found around fellow Southsea Freebooters.
Objective: Slay Lykourgos the Reaver.
