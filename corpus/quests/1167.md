Title: The Tower of Althalaxx
Description: Before confronting Athrikus, it would probably be wise for you to consult with Balthule. I have no doubt he has been vigilant in his watch of the Tower, and he may have information about recent developments.
Objective: Speak with Balthule Shadowstrike near the Tower of Althalaxx.
