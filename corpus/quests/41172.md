Title: War on Venture Co.
Description: Potential is what I see in you, $n. Not many here show it. But you might be the goblin I'm looking for.$B$BMaybe you've witnessed it already or you're just ignorant to the issue, but we're having problems with the... willingness of some workers out here. Call it a strike, sabotage, revolt - I don't care. They're costing me money instead of making it and I'm not having it. If that wasn't enough, their overly aggressive behaviour is a threat to the obedient workers we still have.$B$BOur bruisers got their hands full with keeping order around here, so you will be my instrument of justice. Go out and quell their uprising, immediately. Their medallions will do nicely as proof. According to reports, most of the hostile activity originates from the slum up north.
Objective: Slay Venture Co. traitors and bring their medallions to Taxxlo Rustgate.
