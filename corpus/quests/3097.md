Title: Hallowed Scroll
Description: Ah, while you were off dealing with the mindless Scourge, this scroll arrived for you. I would think it's some matter of importance as it seems it bears the seal of the priest trainer Duesten. I would take some time to read it before heading out again.
Objective: Read the Hallowed Scroll and speak to Dark Cleric Duesten in the church in Deathknell.
