Title: Tainted Tablet
Description: I was tasked with delivering this tablet to you. As if Nartok, the troublesome warlock, weren't enough, another troll has made its way down to the Valley of Trials. He says he is here to teach aspiring warlocks from the local tribes, claiming that his methods are authentic. $B$BHowever, I've never been one for curiosity or taking unnecessary risks. I simply want to stay out of trouble and avoid any conflicts, especially when it comes to something as dangerous as fel. Just remain vigilant and stay safe.
Objective: Read the Tainted Tablet and speak to Zin'jashi inside the Den in the Valley of Trials.
