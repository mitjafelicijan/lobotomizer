Title: Rendezvous with the Infiltrator
Description: Our intelligence on this region is poor. We knew Gilneas was an isolationist nation, but we did not expect it to be in such a miserable state.$B$BBeing among the living, we have no trouble blending in to conduct espionage. One of ours has assumed the name "Greta Longpike", who in her last missive reported she had infiltrated a settlement named Greyshire.$B$BSeek her out and tell her "Night Lady, gold in mouth at dawn". That is the code phrase. She will give you a report, the details of which are of vital importance, that you are to bring back to me.
Objective: Travel to the Ruins of Greyshire, locate Greta Longpike, and acquire the Sealed Report for Livia Strongarm at Blackthorn's Camp in Gilneas.
