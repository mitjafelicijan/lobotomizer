Title: Salvaging the Crops
Description: Weeks it took to fertilize, and toil that ground, and make useable soil, all ruined by a flock of buzzards that swooped down, and ravaged the place for some fresh feed.$B$BBah, dang dumb buzzards!$B$BThere may still be some of the crop harvest left, lucky for us I had just finished bundling it all before those bastards came down and sent me running. Head down the hill toward the farm, kill some to make the rest think twice about freeloading there too long, and gather up 4 bundles of crop harvest, would ye?
Objective: Travel to the farm at Bael Hardul beneath the town, slay 5 Plateau Fleshrippers, and gather 4 Bundled Crop Harvest for Segwar Ironback in Stonetalon Mountains.
