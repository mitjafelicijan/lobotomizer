Title: Excelsior
Description: With the inside finished, all that's left is to add the outer layer. For this, I use only the best elder croc skins. They are more durable and a better canvas--if you will--for adding the designs and accents that make Drizzlik's Excelsior line.$b$bIt's hard to find that perfect skin though, the only one that fits my plan is the skin of an elder saltwater crocolisk. The elders only come out to defend the other saltwater crocs, so you might need to kill a few to draw one out.
Objective: Bring an Elder Crocolisk Skin to Drizzlik in Booty Bay.
