There are, however, more reasons to defend this particular forest than plain love for nature.$B$BThe forest forms a strategic barrier that makes Ashenvale defendable against a large-scale attack. Without it, Astranaar would last a day or two before being annexed to the Barrens.$B$BDo your part in fighting the Warsong Outriders, $N! For the Alliance!
Objective: Bring 3 Warsong Gulch Marks of Honor to an Alliance Brigadier General outside the battlegrounds.
