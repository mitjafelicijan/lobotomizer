Title: Razzeric's Tweaking
Description: Pozzik's a great mechanic, I know that, but he's afraid to just load on the firepower and grab on for the ride. Not me, though.$b$bAfter Pozzik finishes with a racer, I take a little time to put my own modifications on--you know, loosening up the controls, removing parts of the frame, and adding more juice!$b$bI ordered a seaforium booster from Shreev at the Gizmorium in Gadgetzan, but apparently the zeppelin it was being sent on crashed in Dustwallow Marsh! I gotta have it, $n!
Objective: Retrieve the Seaforium Booster for Razzeric in the Shimmering Flats.
