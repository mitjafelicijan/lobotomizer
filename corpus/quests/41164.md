Title: Salvaging Convoys
Description: Are you the promising worker that's been cleaning up all the messes down in the coalpits? You must have something to your name, my brother usually kicks out anyone from the pits sneaking their way into his tower.$B$BI could use your abilities, frankly. In the last weeks we suffered more and more ambushes by the renegade gnolls. Their small dog brains seek violence and chaos, something I cannot understand as a logistics guy. They raided our supply convoys and stole mostly food and weapons, but left most of the tools lying around. Too advanced for them, I'm sure.$B$BWe need those tools back as soon as possible. Vultures and hyenas have been roaming the wrecked carts, feasting on whoever couldn't make it back here. You can find them scattered all over the island, you can't miss 'em.
Objective: Retrieve Rustgate Tools from the broken convoys all over Blackstone Island. Bring them to Supplymaster Maxlo at Rustgate Ridge.
