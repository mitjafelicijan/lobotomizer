Title: Of New and Old IV
Description: I know what it is the Warchief speaks, the Twilight Hammer has recently moved into the Hateforge Quarry, located just south of here.$B$BIt is an annoyance that was eventually going to draw in more attention from our former masters, and was something we would need to deal with eventually, now I implore you to help us with it.$B$BWe may have the strength to fight deep, but to stop the Twilight Hammer lurking deep within the Dark Iron clutches, requires covert strength, not brute strength.$B$BAs Warleader, I ask you to remove the Twilight presence on my behalf.
Objective: Venture into the Hateforge Quarry, and remove the Twilight Hammer presence within for Karfang in Karfang Hold.
