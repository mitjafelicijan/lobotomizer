Title: The Iron Patch
Description: As a double agent, I've been on their ships when they took that orc on the ship, not much of a bright idea since I saw he has no real skill in combat, but if anything he's the perfect pirate, liar, gambler, drunk, you name it.$B$BThey named him Captain of a small fleet and they hope his combat experience would rub off the new recruits, bunch of nonsense.$B$B<Ian spits on the ground.>$B$BYou'll find him on one of the ships, kill him, and bring his head to the Baron, I will lay low, now go before anyone sees us!
Objective: Kill Ironpatch and bring his head to Baron Revilgaz.
