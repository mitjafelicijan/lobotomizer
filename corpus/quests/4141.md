Title: Muigin and Larion
Description: See Larion over there? It's HIS fault we're here!$B$BI told him we were going the wrong way, but would he listen? And would you believe that he's the one that won't speak to me? Well, until he changes his mind, let's have a bit of fun with him.$B$BHave you noticed the strange plant-like creatures around here? They're nothing but trouble, really, but I think if trained properly, I could get them to obey commands.$B$BFirst thing though, I'll need some samples to study. Do you think you could collect some?
Objective: Collect 15 Bloodpetals and return to Muigin.
