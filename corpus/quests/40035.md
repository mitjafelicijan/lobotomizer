Title: Spoils Left Behind
Description: Before we left for the great depths, the Rethress spent some time within Stranglethorn. We butted heads with other Naga there, but otherwise kept low and to ourselves. Tide Mistress Rashal had something of a personal mission far in the east, and we made the island of Jaguero into a temporary base.$B$BIt wasn't long before we returned to the great depths in order to begin our mission here. In our haste, we left behind a small trunk that contains spoils of great importance to us for our future. Go there and gather our spoils!
Objective: Obtain the Rethress Spoils for Hashaz.
