Title: The Gyronautical Compass
Description: A few days back, this human ship was passing by. It didn't seem like anything weird, aside from a boat being all the way out here—that was until a fire started upon the deck, and all manner of chaos erupted. Both murlocs and naga attacked the ship!$B$BThey dragged it down, and the crew escaped somewhere along the coast to the east of here. I'd imagine the boat is still resting along the bottom of the sea, and I want you to go through the wreckage! If the crew knew any gnomes or used any gnomish tools, then there is a very high chance that they had a Gyronautical Compass!$B$BI feel bad for the dead—surely—but it would help us quite a bit if we had such a device! Search the ship and its wreckage. It sank to the southeast.
Objective: Search the wreckage for a Gyronautical Compass.
