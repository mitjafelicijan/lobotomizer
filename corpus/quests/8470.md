Title: Deadwood Ritual Totem
Description: You have found one of the Deadwood furbolg's ritual totems.The totem itself is of non-descript construction, but a palpable sense of despair emanates from it.If there were any object that might best exemplify the corruption that the Deadwood furbolg suffer under, this item would clearly be it.$B$BOne of the furbolgs inside Timbermaw Hold may have a use for such an item... that is, if you've earned their trust enough for them to speak with you.
Objective: Take the Deadwood Ritual Totem inside Timbermaw Hold and see if one of the furbolgs there will find a use for the item.The Timbermaw will not speak with you unless you are of Neutral reputation or greater with them.
