Title: Family Above All
Description: The murloc tadpole stares at you, like it still wants something. But what? More food? No, it's impossible. Maybe it got lost and is looking for its parents? You should look on the shore, they must be somewhere around here.
Objective: Search for the parents of the lost murloc, then return to the murloc tadpole. They should be somewhere on the shore.
