Title: The Mystery of Karazhan V
Description: If Ansirem Runeweaver is correct, then Alarus must be stopped at all costs. To reforge the key to enter the crypt we will require a few items from the souls lingering within the ruins around Karazhan.$B$BFirst, we will need a Mark of Karazhan, an object magically enchanted with the ley energy of the tower. It is said that the twins Andreon and Rothynn were both granted one upon being accepted into the tower guard. Whilst Andreon's whereabouts are unknown, Rothynn's spirit still haunts the caverns of the Master's Cellar.$B$BFinally, there is Groundskeeper Jacoby, one who still to this day lives and tends to the grounds. A man who only appears when not a living soul is looking, only to flee and hide when the living linger. It is from him that the key itself will be collected, so hunt him down.$B$BWhen everything is collected, I can begin to infuse the key with the power it once held, to allow access to the Karazhan Crypt.
Objective: Slay Captain Rothynn to collect the Mark of Karazhan, and retrieve the Old Crypt Key from Groundskeeper Jacoby for Magus Ariden Dusktower in Deadwind Pass.
