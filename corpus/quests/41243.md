Title: A Thirst of Hope
Description: Greetings, child of the Sun. I am Ordenal, a druid sworn to the Dream. A terrible fate has befallen the Quel'dorei, reminding me of the ancient kingdom of the Kaldorei and the Highborne who relied upon the Well of Eternity. When it was lost, my people retreated to the World Tree.$B$BThe Highborne yet survive, though in scant number, and most have fallen to other corruptions to sate their hunger. Such a fate I do not desire for the people here. I would be most grateful for your assistance in testing a theory of mine. I have a few vials of Moonwell water. Would you be so kind as to offer them to the Wretched, and see if, by any chance, it could alleviate their suffering, if only briefly?
Objective: Offer Moonwell Water to the residents of the Wretched Ghetto.
