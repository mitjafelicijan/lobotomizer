Title: Plagueheart Belt
Description: I make no pretenses, maggot. The darkness Plagueheart items hold could very well destroy the both of us. That is why the price is so high. If I'm going to die, it's going to be as a rich man.$B$BAnd I don't give an ounce of gnoll spit how you die, only that you do as I ask. Bring me what I require and we will both benefit - or die; but I've already explained this...
Objective: Mataus the Wrathcaster at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands will make a Plagueheart Belt if you bring him the following: 1 Desecrated Belt, 8 Wartorn Cloth Scraps, 2 Arcane Crystals and 2 Mooncloth.
