Title: Frostfire Bindings
Description: As a Watcher, I was allowed access to many of Medivh's personal effects. Among those items, I found the tomes most enlightening. While the majority of the books were filled with - to put it bluntly - tripe, there were some gems. One of those tomes documented the creation of a set of armor fit for an archmage: Frostfire.$B$B<Angela points to her head.>$B$BIt's all in here and I am willing to share the fruits of that knowledge with you as long as you are able to provide me with the necessary materials.
Objective: Archmage Angela Dosantos at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands will make Frostfire Bindings if you bring her the following: 1 Desecrated Bindings, 6 Wartorn Cloth Scraps, 1 Arcane Crystal and 1 Nexus Crystal.
