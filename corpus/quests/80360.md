Title: Power Taken, Power Given
Description: The journey from our forests in the old world to our new home here in Kalimdor was not only hard on us, but also the loa that protected us on the journey. So far from the forests they have roamed for millennia, they are weakened in their presence here.$B$BFar to the south, the Sandfury trolls of Zul'Farrak have maintained a connection with Kimbul despite their distance from the Gurubashi's jungles. Seek Kimbul's power and return it to me. I will use the power granted by the Sandfury to increase our own loa's presence and strength in these foreign lands.
Objective: Obtain 5 Jujus of Kimbul and bring them to Mystic Guay'jin.
