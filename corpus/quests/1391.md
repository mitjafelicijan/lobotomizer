Title: Nothing But The Truth
Description: We need to operate with a certain amount of discretion. After all, it's not like you're going to waltz in there and convince the fool to drink Faustin's concoction here, right?$b$bBut if there's one thing those humans cannot deny it's the booze. I'll take Faustin's serum and mix it into this ale. I guarantee the poor sap will show no reluctance when it comes to chug-a-lugging a brew.$b$bMake haste to Stonard in the Swamp of Sorrows, $n. And keep our little mission nice and quiet...
Objective: Take Zraedus's Brew to Infiltrator Marksen in Stonard.
