Title: Leather Letter
Description: I just received a letter that was addressed to you. One of the locals knows you well and requested that you meet with them. Congratulations once more on your sharp aim and bravery; you are certainly destined to serve the Alliance well. Old Jonah has grown impatient due to his advanced age, but please do not let him catch you mentioning it.
Objective: Read the Leather Letter and speak to Old Jonah behind Northshire Abbey.
