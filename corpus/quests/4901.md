Title: Guardians of the Altar
Description: At the very top of the ridge lies what I believe to be an altar of the goddess Elune. From what I can tell, we need to light the five torches in each cave, and then we will be able to access the altar directly.$B$BI transcribed some incantations carved into the stone in the ancient ruins of Kel'Theril, which I believe are the secret to unlocking the altar. I'll need your help to light each torch, while I recite the spell.$B$BIf we are successful, you'll be able to report our findings to Erelas!
Objective: Protect Ranshalla while she attempts to reactivate the Altar of Elune. Report your findings to Erelas Ambersky in Rut'theran Village.
