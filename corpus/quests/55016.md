Title: The Skystormer Project
Description: Azshara seems hopeless, but for all that's failed and everything I've tried out here I still have a few more things left to try.$B$BWithin the region there is a species of hippogryph known as Thunderheads. They can be found all over the area but I'm looking for the ones with the real power to get the best results!$B$BFar to the north-east near the very edges of the Azshara plateau are Thunderhead Skystormers. Now they're really the kingpins of the Thunderheads. Grab me 3 Skystormer Antlers, that's where they gotta hold their power.$B$BBring em to me so we can test if they hold any ability for energy.
Objective: Slay Thunderhead Skystormers for Skystormer Antlers far to the north-east of Azshara.
