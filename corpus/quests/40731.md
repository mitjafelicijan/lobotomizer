Title: A Costly Favor
Description: Well, I am stumped, All of my ideas either end up worthless, or failed. There must be something that I can...$B$B<Tazzo's eyes blink back to life, but soon a sigh escapes him.>$B$BThere is something actually, I just remembered. A 'friend' of mine named Leezza used to work far in the north. When we were on better terms she once told me about seeing a ridiculously large banana, too big for her to move.$B$BThis has to be what we're looking for, but if we want this information, I know its going to cost me an arm and a leg... You could go to Tel Co. Basecamp, speak on my behalf, aside, I don't really got any gold, and I know she will ask.
Objective: Find a way to buy the information of the Gargantuan Banana from Leezza Fraxtoggle at Tel Co. Basecamp. in Tel'abim.
