Title: Lofty Heights
Description: I have one more test to prove my theory, and redirect some attention here from the Cenarion Circle!$B$BIf the loss of life did not reach far out to sea, perhaps it did not reach far into the mountains either?$B$BThere is a beautiful bloom native to here, Mashan'she Silversage. It grows high up, but where there is a sea breeze too. I would start on the northwestern shore, $r. Search whichever hills and mountains you can climb, and try to find some of those blooms! It matters so much to me, I would be eternally grateful.
Objective: Seek out Mashan'she Silversage for Selendra.
