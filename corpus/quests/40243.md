Title: The Keepers Charge
Description: For thousands of years I have kept my watch over this place. I have seen the world change around me, and most of the old city be swept beneath the waves. The magic that once ran through this place has been dampened and is almost non-existent.$B$BWith the rising waters my studies have been increasingly difficult. To keep watch over this tower is to protect it, and with the growing threat of the invasive ocean species my time has been more toward survival then study.$B$BI ask for assistance in this matter. Slay the murloc, the hydra and the crab beasts around the area to preserve this tower if even for a moment longer.
Objective: Slay 5 Storm Bay Warrior, 5 Wave Thrasher, and 3 Makrinni Scrabbler
