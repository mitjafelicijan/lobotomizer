Title: The Race
Description: So, not only the Horde, but now we have to worry about some damned cult as well? Uh, I must say, I don't like this, but this is only one more reason why we must acquire plates before anyone else. Who knows what secrets Uldum hides.$B$B<He pulls out a map and points to a place in the northern mountains of Un'goro Crater.>$B$BIf what Vess found out is true, then the first piece of the set should be right at this location. While you are busy with this task, I will prepare a well-armed expedition to search for the second piece at the Swamp of Sorrows.
Objective: Disable 6 Altar Guardians at the Titan's Ruined Altar in the northern region of Un'goro Crater and bring the Plate of Uldum to High Explorer Magellas at Ironforge.
