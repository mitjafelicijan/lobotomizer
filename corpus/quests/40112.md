Title: Disturbing Silence
Description: While I'm glad to see you return, I feel a disturbance in the air. The war party that I have sent to the Swamp of Sorrows has not returned, nor did they send any message. Logrash's warning still circles my mind.$B$B$N, you have done so much already for us, but I would ask you to check on the war party. The location Logrash marked for us points us towards the southeastern part of the swamps along the mountains.$B$BMaybe this is just an old man worrying, but I cannot shake this feeling of unease.
Objective: Sage Truthseeker wants you to search for his missing war party in the eastern part of the Swamp of Sorrows.
