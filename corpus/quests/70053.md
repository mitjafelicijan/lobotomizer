Title: The Loch Menace
Description: Something's wrong with the threshadons, $N. They are out of their hiding place and are eating all the fish of the lake!$B$BFor a while now, our local fishing business has been in a decline thanks to that. I am afraid we'll have to accept the fact that we must cull their numbers so that we can maintain a certain balance.$B$BThey are beautiful creatures we've shared the lake with for generations, so it pains me that we must take such extreme actions against them.$B$BIt's only expected of me to ask an outsider to do what we can't, and are not willing to do.
Objective: Slay Threshadons in Loch Modan and return to Warg Deepwater in Loch Modan.
