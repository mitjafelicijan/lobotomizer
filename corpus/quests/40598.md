Title: The Old Church of Westfall VI
Description: Now that you've heard my story you can understand what has happened. If anyone is responsible for shutting down the church and the murder of the Easton Family, my suspicions lay toward Carver Molsen. He inherited that farmstead and was always greedy for more, even going so far as to join the Defias.$B$BHopefully my information is relevant for you, perhaps you can bring it to Gryan Stoutmantle, he is in charge of the People's Militia there.
Objective: Bring your findings to Gryan Stoutmantle at Sentinel Hill in Westfall.
