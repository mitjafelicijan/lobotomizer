Title: No More-pid!
Description: Why in the name of Doomhammer has this plague spread the land? Scorpids!$B$BIt didn't used to be this way, but now every time I leave Razor Hill, scorpids! In my tent, my shoes, my armor, always more scorpids! They're more of a nuisance to me than a real danger, but each time I get stung I have to drink a healing potion or head back to town for help. I’m sick of it!$B$BI'm nursing my latest sting right now, but you look like you’re up to the task of a hunt. Head out and kill every scorpid you find! It's not like you'll have any issue finding them...
Objective: Kill 10 Armored Scorpid. Stomping on their tails is not required, but may make you feel better. Return to Yelnagi Blackarm in Razor Hill.
