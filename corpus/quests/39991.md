Title: Securing the Roads
Description: I'm glad you've decided to join us $n. I've heard of the work you've done in the field, and I must say I'm impressed. You are exactly the kind of highly motivated individual we need in this organization.$B$BIf we are to hold this castle in the long term, we must secure our supply lines. I'd like you to ambush that prick Valorcall and end his patrols once and for all. He has guards accompanying him, so be careful, perhaps even bring another operative to assist you, but get it done! Do not return to me until he's dead.
Objective: Kill Lieutenant Valorcall and the 2 Stromgarde Cavalrymen who patrol with him.
