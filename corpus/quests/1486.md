Title: Deviate Hides
Description: As Naralex descended deeper into his nightmare, a strange breed of beasts arose from beneath the Barrens into the Wailing Caverns.$b$bThese deviate creatures have strange, otherworldly properties. While evil in nature, it is my opinion that some good can come from their existence here in Kalimdor. I believe their hides will be of particular use in the ways of leatherworking.$b$bIf you feel up to the task, venture into the caves below and retrieve some deviate hides.
Objective: Nalpak in the Wailing Caverns wants 20 Deviate Hides.
