Title: In Gunther’s Favor
Description: I sometimes long for Dalaran and of the days I once lived as no more than a mere student of the arcane arts.$B$BWhen the Scourge shackled me to their dominion, my old memories were the only tether that kept me from losing myself utterly.$B$BI do not intend to burden you with my life's story, $N, but I already know what this vial is and how it was made, yet I need you to do me a favor before I tell you. Think of it as an equivalent exchange.$B$BGo to the decadent town of Ambermill: Behind its town hall I buried a locket and sealed it with magic.$B$BI will give you a scroll that will erase its warding spell, retrieve the locket, and return it to me. Then we shall talk.
Objective: Travel behind Ambermill and dig for Gunther’s locket.
