Description: For this restorative salve, you must use a simple formula: one part poison, two parts cure.You have acquired one cure, now you must gather the poison.$b$bPowerful undead, such as the lingering highborne who wander the Ruins of Eldarath, are sometimes so infused with evil that it coalesces into a sickly greenish goo.To the living, this substance is known as ichor of undeath.$b$bDue to the potency of this vile element, I require only a single ichor.
Objective: Acquire an Ichor of Undeath for Ogtinc in Azshara.Ogtinc resides atop the cliffs northeast the Ruins of Eldarath.
