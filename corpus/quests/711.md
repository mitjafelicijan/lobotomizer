Title: Study of the Elements: Rock
Description: $N, you've already proven more able than all my apprentices combined.$B$BThe next parts I need require a little more strength. Large stone slabs can be found on rock elementals if you're careful enough. Their bodies are stronger and larger, and therefore more prone to having pieces large enough for my tests. You can find them further west of here or southeast along the mountains' edges.$B$BTake your time; I'll need a while to test these smaller pieces you brought me.
Objective: Bring 3 Large Stone Slabs to Lotwil Veriatus in the Badlands.
