Title: The Aqua Stone
Description: Margon the Mighty and his son Hargul the Hardy are two sea giants that roam the island of Lapidis and the surrounding waters. Hargul especially has been something of a nuisance and attacked Caelan's Rest many weeks ago. Whilst no one was harmed, he did away with a few items of importance before the marines had assembled and figured out a plan to stop him.$B$BOne such item was the Aqua Stone, a magically potent stone that has been channeled with the energy of powerful Hydromancers. With this stone, we could store more accurately channel our abilities. I would like you to reclaim it, to slay Hargul the Hardy and reclaim this valuable treasureâ€”not just for us Hydromancers, but so that it does not fall in the wrong hands.$B$BYou should find Hargul somewhere off the coast of Lapidis. He was last seen on the Bright Coast to the west.
Objective: Recover the Aqua Stone from Hargul the Hardy.
