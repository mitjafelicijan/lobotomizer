Title: Revenge of the Deep
Description: We've encountered many ghastly creatures on our voyages. From murlocs to naga, sharks to hydras. But personally, nothing from the depths gives me more shivers than these shelled horrors with their giant, snappy claws! Just look at them: the long, beady eyes, the razorsharp legs and their barnacle covered shell - UGH!$B$B$n, go down there and show them what they get for sinking my ship and making a feast out of my crew!
Objective: Take revenge on the makrura on the southerwestern coast of Blackstone Island and report back to Dazlon Brassdigger.
