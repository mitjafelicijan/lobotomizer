Title: The Rampant Groveweald
Description: The Foulweald have long since lost their minds, set into a state of delusion and ferocity. When the tribe began to lose itself, many set out toward the Crescent Grove to the south in hopes of escaping the madness. I placed my hopes in my people, but still, I lost them to insanity.$B$BThe furbolg who traveled to Crescent Grove may have sought refuge and a new place to call home, but they did not escape that which sent the Foulweald into madness. They, too, have become aggressive, irrational, and uncaring for the world around them. Many of those I called friends, those I called family, went to the Groveweald, and they are nothing how I remember them.$B$BThe Groveweald must be stopped. Gather what mercenaries or fellow adventurers you can, and brave to the Crescent Grove. Slay them and gather their Groveweald Badges as proof of the deed. You must do it for the good of the forest, and for the good of my people.
Objective: Venture into the Crescent Grove and collect 8 Groveweald Badges from the furbolgs inside for Grol the Exile.
