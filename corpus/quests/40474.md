Title: The Harvest Golem Mystery
Description: Okay, listen then. I need you to bring this blueprint to a man named Maltimor Gartside. Maltimor. Gartside. Got it? Good.$B$BHe's an old man, in his fifties, maybe sixties. Long, gray hair, kind of skinny, pale skin. Hard to miss, you will know it's him. Yes, he's my employer. And yes, I know where he lives.$B$BWouldn't want you to scour through all of Westfall, of course. Go west of Sentinel Hill, but north of Moonbrook. He lives in a solitary cottage, usually spends his time outside of it. Don't know why, didn't ask, didn't care. So, you meet him, tell him I said hello and give him the blueprints. Easy!$B$BAlso, please, be careful. It is very, very important that those blueprints don't fall into the hands of those bandits with red bandanas, the Defias, as they call themselves. Light be with you, friend.
Objective: Deliver the Harvester Blueprint to Maltimor Gartside at the Gartside Plot in Westfall.
