Title: Report from Gnomeregan!
Description: I'm honestly shocked I heard back from Flaxwhisker Front. I had assumed that they already knew what happened in Gnomeregan! The collapse of Gnomeregan destroyed almost all of our logistics heading that way, and it is impossible to help them out.$B$BI want you to send Gigno this letter. I've included some coins in there to fund the journey back for the gnomes in Azshara. Make sure he gets this; it holds all the information he will need to get him up to date on what happened!
Objective: Bring Tinkmaster Overspark's Response to Gigno Flaxwhisker.
