Title: The Fall of Ameth'Aran
Description: To the east you will find the ruins of Ameth'Aran. It is now inhabited by the restless spirits of the Highborne that once dwelt within its walls, but once it was a place where the servants of Azshara freely practiced their powerful magics.$b$bI was sent to explore the ruins and came across two large tablets, scrawled with the stories of Ameth'Aran and its fall. While I read the runes, I was accosted by the spirits, and fled.$b$bPlease, if you can, venture to the ruins and decipher the tablets in my place.
Objective: Study the tablets which tell of Ameth'Aran and of its fall, then return to Sentinel Tysha Moonblade in Darkshore.
