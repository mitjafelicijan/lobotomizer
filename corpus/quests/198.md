Title: Supplies to Private Thorsen
Description: Hmm. Yes, I do have something you could do, actually. Lieutenant Doren and his followers up in the north need their regular supplies from us.$b$bThey haven't been delivered, and with the trolls attacking, I'll need someone to do it. Doren's camp lies northwest of the road at the entrance to Stranglethorn from Duskwood. Give the supplies to Private Thorsen, if he's not in the camp, then he'll be patrolling south of it. He'll take care of them.$b$bMind you, if you fail, you'll owe me restitution.
Objective: Deliver the Miscellaneous Goblin Supplies to Private Thorsen.
