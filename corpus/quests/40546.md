Title: Small Murloc in a Big Pond
Description: It pains me to tell this, but his parents are probably... ehm, dead. Murlocs, while ferocious and territorial, care deeply for their tadpoles. I have seen them sacrificing themselves so their children could live. Truly, we should appreciate these creatures more.$B$BAnd one more thing. If you want this little murloc to live, it will need your help. Hinterlands are dangerous. It won't survive on its own.
Objective: Go back to the murloc tadpole in Hinterlands.
