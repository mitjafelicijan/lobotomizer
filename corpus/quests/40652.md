Title: Eyes on the Prize
Description: Ah, a moment of your time please, $n?$B$BYes, yes, I know who you are. I was planning on discussing this issue with Senator Redstone, since he appears to have a passing interest in the goings on in the Badlands. But since you have fortuitously come to me, perhaps you will listen to my request.$B$BMy brother is part of an expeditionary party down there, you see. A prospector, but he has his mind set on ridiculous fairy tales and is chasing legends. He has lost sight of what is important! There is much wealth and knowledge to be gained from scratching the surface of the earth, never mind delving into its depths.$B$BSeek out the digsites in the northern part of the Badlands. Beware, I think the Dark Iron Dwarves are excavating there and are unlikely to enjoy onlookers. Come back when you have a nice collection of artefacts.$B$BOh, and $n? If you can't pick them up from the ground, feel free to take them directly from their hands.
Objective: Gather 8 dusty relics from the Angor Digsite in the Badlands for Senator Ryedol in Ironforge.
