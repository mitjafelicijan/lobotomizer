Title: A Crystal Clear Task
Description: Greetings, $R. Since you're here this means you've come to help so listen up. We have a situation here... You might be aware that our buildings use arcane magic to operate.$B$BWhile our central crystal is the main power source, we use smaller crystals to effectively channel the arcane energy from the nexus to the outlying ley points of the structure.$B$BThe downside is that these crystals break down overtime, if we had found this outpost a decade later the entire Academy could have collapsed.$B$BFortunately, our predecessors built this site on a location with arcane crystal deposits. While the automated constructs have long since stopped working or malfunctioned, the mine remains full of intact crystals.$B$BI need you to head down there and bring me some crystals. Eight should do for now.$B$BAre you still here? Get moving.
Objective: Gather 8 Arcane Crystals from the Silver Sun Mine in Alah'Thalas.
