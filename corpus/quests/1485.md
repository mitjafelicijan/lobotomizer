Title: Vile Familiars
Description: Those warlocks who came before us have earned the distrust of the Horde, and while we are tolerated, we are not loved.$b$bThis has not brought the warlocks closer together, however, as many choose to live reclusively, dabbling in their magics alone. I will not seek to lead you down one path or the other, but only help you in your maturation.$b$bBefore I teach you the art of summoning, bring me six heads of the vile familiars from the cave to the northeast.
Objective: Bring 6 Vile Familiar Heads to Ruzan.
