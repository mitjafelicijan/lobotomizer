Title: Mechaflame's Bargain
Description: Alright, you're here to steal my finds? I've been keeping my eye on these statues for a while. I'm not gonna let some random $R come in and take my loot, understand? Besides, we can't carry all of them anyway. There are four more scattered around these ruins.$B$BSay, how about a truce? You get me some parts and I'll come up with a gnomish contraption that can shrink them down. We'll split up the statues, three for me, two for you. Remember, I'm the one who came up with this plan, after all.$B$BSo you got all that, bub? Then, get me those materials and let's make these statues more portable.
Objective: Gather the materials and return to Ruins of Isildien.
