Title: Venture Co. Expansion
Description: Hey, you there, lookin for some coin?$B$BI got a big important job that I need done and need done quick. The Venture Company has continued its expansion in Stonetalon, adding even more of its goons and lackeys to the war on resources. With every pair of boots that they put on the ground we lose influence!$B$BJust to the northeast of here is a little place called the Venture Camp, and its now the hub of some new operation for cutting wood. Led by a well reknowned and cruel overseer named Fazwick Longfuse, and if you come from Kezan his name should resonate well.$B$BIf Powder Town is to survive we must push them out of the Stonetalon Mountains for good, and send a message to not come back! Find that Venture Camp, and kill that Fazwick Longfuse, along with any goons that stand in your way, got it?
Objective: Gather 15 Venture Company Armbands and slay Overseer Fazwick Longfuse near the Venture Camp for Security Officer Mort Tozzlefume at Powder Town in Stonetalon Mountains.
