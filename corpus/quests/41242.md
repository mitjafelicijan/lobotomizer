Title: They Came From the West
Description: Our people sought refuge in the South. While the Dwarves sheltered our caravans, the Humans welcomed us into their newly conceived Alliance. Along with it, we attained the allegiance of the so-called Kaldorei. Despite our differences, it seems that our people share some commonalities.$B$BThough not all welcomed our utilization of magic, the addiction it induces, and the casualties it begets — of which you already see in our afflicted — some were willing to assist. Among them is a Druid residing beyond our ghetto, a person named Ordenal Owlmane. He dwells underneath a tree resembling the outlines of two mighty beasts. He speaks of our redemption through the power of the Dream and the Moon. If you truly believe our race holds any chance of survival, pay him a visit.
Objective: Speak to Ordenal Owlmane just outside of the Wretched Ghetto.
