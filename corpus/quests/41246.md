Title: Restless Autumn
Description: There is something that does not allow the spirits of the fallen to rest in these forests. I have my concerns and I truly do not wish for them to be true. Before that, as I am not to leave my station here, I will ask you to bring peace to these restless souls.$B$BBe not afraid, for they can be slain, and if by any chance they resemble someone you know, look away. It is wrong for them to be here and they must return to the cradle of the world beyond.
Objective: Slay the restless spirits of the Isle of Eternal Autumn.
