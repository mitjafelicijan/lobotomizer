Title: Thalestien's Notes
Description: A student of Thalestien? How exciting!$B$BThalestien was not exactly like the rest of the High Elves, he really enjoyed tinkering with gizmos and scraps as much as we did! But his craft also used a hefty amount of the Arcane, which in truth was a very smart choice. It's no less to tell that people like him were a true inspiration to Engineering today.$B$BThe Arcane Golems were the product of high ingeniosity, but I'm afraid Thalestien's notes are lost. The last time I had them I was in a small house North West of Brewnall Village, you could try there. Just be aware that Leper Gnomes might guard the area. If you were to get those notes, I believe a new age for Engineering could begin! Working with the High Elves from this aspect would be very exciting.
Objective: Find Thalestien's notes North West of Brewnall Village for Masey Wirefuse in Ironforge.
