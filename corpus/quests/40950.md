Title: On Legend's Trail
Description: You have my thanks. While it would be best for us to return to Ravenshire and report to Darius, I must have you do something else. You must follow my sister's footsteps.$B$BBefore she managed to escape, she spoke of Mother's stories, though they were nothing more than fairy tales. Alas, it seems that Tess was strongly convinced of the Wolf-Serpent and its followers named the Pellars. She left for the middle of the land, in search of a legend, which is why you must do the same. Find my sister and deliver her safely to Ravenshire.$B$BWe shall meet there once more, since lingering here is the last thing on my mind.$B$BGo with the Light, friend, may it shine brightest when you most need it.
Objective: Find Tess Greymane beneath the great tree at the center of Gilneas.
