Title: Unforseen Consequences
Description: I spent much time among the keepers on Stonetalon Peak. It was a time of tranquility, to find true balance of self and harmony with nature. In my time there, I learned much of how best to wield the power of the land to conserve and protect nature. It is only when I began my work here within Teldrassil that my efforts began to falter, and there have been... complications.$B$BIt would appear the land itself holds some taint that I cannot grasp. I have struggled in my efforts to bend nature's will, straining myself more than ever before, and one of my Protectors has withered away and broken its bond with me.$B$BI would ask you to speak with Tasala Whitefeather, the one who once lead the harpies within the region, and ask her if she has news of the treant. Do not worry; she is free from the evil that grips her kind.$B$BYou should find her just down the hill to the north. Follow the road and you will see her near the cliff's edge.
Objective: Speak with Tasala Whitefeather in Teldrassil.
