Title: To Raise An Ancient
Description: Now that you have the core all that you need to do is return to Ordenal and he will know exactly what needs to be done. This is the core of an Ancient, one that has not been seen in a long time. I bet even Ordenal will be awed as you give him the core.$B$BWith the Ancient being brought back to life and being around the city of Alah'Thalas it will help the Quel'dorei with their meditation. This is once again, not a permanent solution. Regardless, it is the best we have.
Objective: Awaken the Ancient of Arcane.
