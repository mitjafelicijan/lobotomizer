Title: As Water Cascades
Description: Use this empty vial and fill up on some moonwell water here in Auberdine.Such potent magic should provide a clue as to the composition of the crystal.To do that, you'll pour the liquid over the crystal; it should take care of the rest.$B$BWhile I don't anticipate anything bad happening to you, I still want you to be careful.Above us to the east is Felwood; if that crystal is tied to that place as I suspect it is, then it could prove to be very dangerous.
Objective: Fill the Empty Water Tube at the Auberdine moonwell, and then investigate the red crystal along Darkshore's eastern mountain wall.
