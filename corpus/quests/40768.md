Description: Each day more and more Naga take to the shores of the surrounding islands, they are gathering and for what purpose I do not know.$B$BI would rather have them dealt with now, than in a week when there are hundreds of them. I have heard tales of just how quick they can infest an area with their presence.$B$BYou can find them all around the surrounding Jagged Isles to the north, find them, and kill them, bring me twenty of their scales as proof.
Objective: Gather 20 Wavecrest Scales for Zalwiz Hardlug at Bixxle's Storehouse in Tel'Abim.
