Title: Dim Light in the Darkness
Description: While you were searching for Tess, I was trying to make my way back to Ravenshire. I dealt with some traitors that sold our country to the Harlows, first, though. With the Light at my side, I wished to rest among the dead and pay my respects to Mother's grave.$B$BAs I reached the crypt, I saw a rugged, unfamiliar face. One that showed only aggression to me. Growling like an animal. To say the least, I was not well received, yet they've offered me shelter. They are a strange bunch, led by a stoic, violent lady. Her name is Moranna, she is leading a group of four, and they claim to be a cult that researches immortality. I figure that she might be of aid to us. Reach her at the Hollow Web Cemetery to the west.
Objective: Find Moranna Rosenberg at the Hollow Web Cemetary in Gilneas.
