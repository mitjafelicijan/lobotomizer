Title: The Vile Reef
Description: Long ago, a great shudder of the earth sunk an old troll city beneath the waters of the Savage Coast to the northwest.We call that place the Vile Reef, for murlocs now reside in the ruins of the city, attacking any who draw close.$B$BThere is an old tablet among those ruins that tells the ancient tale of Gri'lek, a hero of troll legends.The tale is sacred to the Darkspear tribe, and although the tablet is too large to move, I want a shard of it to enshrine in our new home in Orgrimmar.
Objective: Bring a Tablet Shard to Kin'weelay at the Grom'gol Base Camp.
