Title: The Missing Diplomat
Description: The Defias didn't pay me well enough to die for their cause. They took the king. Yeah, the king of Stormwind, not some lowly diplomat. He was on his way to Theramore to meet with Jaina Proudmore--it was a big deal apparently, and a big secret. But it's not just the Defias that are involved. They're working with someone. I think they knew this was bigger than them.$B$BMy part was just to get their man on board the king's ship while it was in the harbor. The guy's name was Hendel. That's all I know. I swear!
Objective: Speak to Mikhail in the Wetlands.
