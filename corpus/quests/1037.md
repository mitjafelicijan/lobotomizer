Title: Velinde Starsong
Description: Velinde Starsong was my predecessor here in Ashenvale Forest. At first it seemed she had the situation in Felwood under control, but little by little her efforts faltered. One day, she simply disappeared.$b$bI was sent here to continue her work. I'm afraid I know nothing of the priestess, however. Perhaps Thyn'tel Bladeweaver, one of the commanders of the Sentinels, knows further details of her disappearance that I was not a party to.$b$bSurely she will understand the import of such information.
Objective: Speak with Thyn'tel Bladeweaver at the Warrior's Terrace in Darnassus.
