Title: A Razor's Edge
Description: The knife embeds itself into the palm at the slightest press. Truly this could cut through almost any living tissue, but the handle is awkward and heavy. Holding it up, the sun glints across the pristine surface. Perhaps someone interested in survival techniques could make use of this beauty.
Objective: Find someone interested in the knife, perhaps one keen on survival.
