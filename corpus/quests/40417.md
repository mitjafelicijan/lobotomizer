Title: Delivery to Wallace
Description: While you are still here, could I ask of you a favor? I desire to send my brother something that perhaps can assist him. As much as he down plays his work in Theramore, I do know from stories I have heard that the swamp is crawling with all manner of orc and dragon.$B$BI had a fireheated shield made some time ago, and haven't had the chance to sell it yet, I would much rather that it gets to him out there, then to sit in my shop and collect dust, aside, there is no finer gift I can give.$B$BTake this shield to him out in Dustwallow Marsh, it would mean quite a lot to me.
Objective: Deliver Bryan's Fireheated Shield to Captain Wallace Cross in Dustwallow Marsh.
