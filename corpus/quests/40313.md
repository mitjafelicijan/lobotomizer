Title: The Mystery of Karazhan III
Description: The energy of the substance is intense, and would take me considerable time to unweave. My master Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver within Dalaran is well versed within such magic, and would have a much easier time.$B$BI ask of you to bring him the Ghostly Substance and figure out the true potency and origin of the magic contained. Perhaps then, we can figure out how to best deal with the foreign energy lingering beneath Karazhan.
Objective: Take Ariden's Crate to Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver in Dalaran.
