Title: A Pebble to Pick with Them
Description: Hail adventurer! You look like you can carry yourself in a fight. My colleagues and I ran into a bit of a pickle, you see. This is Bael Modan, a facility built by a powerful race that disappeared eons ago. According to some scholars, these Titans had a hand in the formation of our culture.$B$BWe were trying to open the door in the main chamber when a horrible screech echoed through the digsite. Dozens of statues we dug up came to life and went on a rampage. Those golems have no archaeological value when they try to kill you if you get near them. Get in there and smash them up so we can carry on our work.
Objective: Kill 16 Bael'modan Golems in the Bael'modan digsite.
