Title: The Harvest Golem Mystery
Description: I can decipher this for you, of course. But first: you say a word to any guard in the town that I can do this, you're gone. And second: it will cost you. You're lucky that I'm in need of an adventurer to perform some easy and simple tasks...$B$BFirst, I need silk. But not any kind of silk. Spider silk bathed in moonlight, extraordinarily beautiful. Hard to get though. Only found in Duskwood, to my knowledge. Bring me at least ten samples, we will see if it's good enough.
Objective: Gather 10 Moonlight Silk samples for Franklin Hamar in Lakeshire.
