Title: Find Ranshalla
Description: Yes, yes, these feathers seem to hold the same magical enchantment that I noticed previously... While I am not certain what we might find, I urge you to continue searching for answers, $N.$B$BA colleague of mine recently traveled into Winterspring to observe the wildkin there, in their own habitat. Why don't you catch up with her and see what she has found?
Objective: Find Ranshalla in eastern Winterspring.
