Title: Hearts of Zeal
Description: Why do I need a rare type of guano, you might ask. Well, for this experiment I want to see what effect two diametrically opposed chemical substances can have on each other, especially when both are combined with an ever-toxic agent to ensure the most... ghastly results.$b$bIn the northeastern peaks of Tirisfal Glades lies the Scarlet Monastery. There the crazed disciples of the Scarlet Crusade congregate. Slay them and bring me their zealous hearts.$b$bOur concoction will be most wicked!
Objective: Master Apothecary Faranell in the Undercity wants 20 Hearts of Zeal.
