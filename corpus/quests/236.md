Title: Watcher Callahan
Description: A few weeks ago, I dispatched Watcher Callahan and a few others to the northern border of Duskwood to deal with the wolf infestation. I haven't heard word from him for quite some time. If he followed my instructions, he'll be camped out on the road north from Darkshire. $B$BIf it's on your way, please check up on him and inform him that I am awaiting a progress report from him.
Objective: Speak with Watcher Callahan.
