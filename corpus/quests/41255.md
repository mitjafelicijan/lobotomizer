Title: Deepmurk Shipment
Description: A moment of your time?$B$BI'm the dockmaster here, for the lack of a better word. As you can probably imagine, there's a lot of movement to our newfound home, and we receive a lot of supplies from our steadfast allies.$B$BHowever, one of the ships that was due to arrive a few days ago has been lost. I fear the worst, especially with the talk of naga along the shore.$B$BThe shipment was very important, so I would pay you handsomely if you could go to the Farstride and search for it. There is a possibility that what was left of it was stolen by the Deepmurk murlocs, if so, they probably took the supplies to their lair.
Objective: Retrieve the shipment for Saelyn Seastrider. Deepmurk Cave might be a good place to start your search.
