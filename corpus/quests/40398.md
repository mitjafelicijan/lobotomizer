Title: By Any Means Necessary II
Description: You have proven to be a potential ally, and such allies are rare in these parts. If you truly wish to earn my favor, there is something you can do.$B$BThere is an elusive satyr named Pustax, a warped mockery of his previous name no doubt. He has caused much destruction and death in these parts, and has personally slain members of my family. I need his head; he has lived for far too long. He is known to lurk between Shatter Scar Vale and Irontree Woods, so start your search there. Bring me what I desire.
Objective: Hunt down the Satyr Pustax, and return his head to Niremius Darkwind in Felwood.
