Title: The Key to Karazhan III
Description: I sense that you possess Medivh's key. Though I am unsure how you came into its possession, I must warn you: not all is what it seems, and the powers residing in Upper Chambers are beyond your comprehension.$B$BWhen Medivh was younger, he often hosted a certain Kirin Tor mage in the tower. His name was Vandol, and if anyone could be able to repair the key, it's him.$B$BMake haste, for there are ominous noises emanating from the Upper Chambers, and I fear that the situation there will only become worse.
Objective: Find someone from the Kirin Tor who might know something about Vandol. Dalaran could be a good place to start your search.
