Title: Mai'Zoth
Description: Kurzen may be dead, but...that which drove him to evil still lives!Through my studies I have discovered this: An Ogre Mage - Mai'Zoth - dwells in an Ogre Mound within the eastern mountains of Stranglethorn.He is rumored to employ mind-controlling magic, and I am positive that he corrupted Kurzen.$B$BIf Mai'Zoth is allowed to live, then his evil may influence others, and may even cause another Kurzen to surface.$B$BKill him, and bring me his Mind's Eye, the artifact he uses to corrupt others.
Objective: Bring the Mind's Eye to Brother Nimetz at the Rebel Camp.
