Title: Gathering Intel
Description: You're less wet behind the ears, now, which is good.$B$BThe vermin you've defeated are only a nuisance compared to other things that lurk in this valley. Some of the recent refugees who arrived last night reported seeing a short-statured figure with glowing red eyes in the woods as it stalked the area.$B$BSome brushed it off as fatigue from the long travel, but I believe it may be the forward scout of a Shadowforge raiding party.$B$BThe Shadowforge are one of the Dark Iron clans. They are corrupted red-eyed dwarves who are at odds with the kingdom of Ironforge. Investigate the area to the west where the sighting happened, but do not stray too close to the digsite. It is infested with troggs far stronger than those vermin that you fought earlier.$B$BRemember: do not engage. If you find something, confirm your sighting and immediately return here.
Objective: Investigate the area to the southwest of the Farstrider Lodge.
