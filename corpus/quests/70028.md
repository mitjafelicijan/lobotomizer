Title: Demon Fall Canyon

Simple minded buffoons who lost their commander.$B$BSometimes I ask myself what would have happened if Hellscreamâ€¦ doesn't matter now.$B$BFalling down into the Demon Fall Canyon you will see numerous spawns of the Burning Legion. As you should know, a great demon fell there, hence the namesake, I suppose.$B$BYour mission is clear, yet, not so simple. Wreak havoc and cull their numbers. I expect you do whatever you see fit to leave none alive.
