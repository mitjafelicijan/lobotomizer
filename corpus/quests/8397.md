Title: Claiming Arathi Basin
Description: Winning a war is about more than just outsmarting and outfighting your opponent. Victory often comes down to simply producing more than your enemy.$B$BWhat we have in Arathi Basin is a sizeable supply of resources for whichever side manages to claim it first.$B$BIf the Alliance comes out victorious, it'll mean more swords and pikes for our troops. If the Horde were to win, those swords and pikes would still get made, they'd just be pointed at us! Now is the time to help the Alliance in Arathi Basin, $N.
Objective: Bring 3 Arathi Basin Marks of Honor to an Alliance Brigadier General outside the battlegrounds.
