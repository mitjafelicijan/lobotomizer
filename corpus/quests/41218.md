Title: Grapes in the Hills
Description: Greetings, friend. Have you come to savor our renowned wines? Regrettably, due to the incessant lynx attacks, grape cultivation in the hills had to be halted, leaving us with naught.$B$BYet, I harbor optimism that amidst the chaos, our workers may have left behind buckets still brimming with grapes in the hills southeast of this abode. They might be a tad fermented by now, but isn't the essence of winemaking in embracing such nuances? If you could retrieve even ten buckets, I could conjure up some wine for prospective patrons! Your assistance would be invaluable.
Objective: Bring 10 Buckets of Grapes to Fainriel Silverharp in the Thaumarium.
