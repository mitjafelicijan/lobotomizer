Title: Preparation for Divination
Description: Very well. If it is Captain Vimes' wish... who am I to say no? But, if we are to make the ritual as safe as possible for the spirit and for us, I will need some rare ingredients. Your best bet would be buying them in Dalaran... well, if it still existed.$B$BI have heard rumors that the Kirin Toris trying to rebuild the magical city, so if you don't mind traveling... Maybe they have some ingredients needed. The rest can be found in these swamps, if you have a keen eye.$B$BI need 1 Arcane Resonator from Dalaran, 3 Lesser Moonstones and 10 Swamp Ooze Ichors. I heard reports of ooze abominations in the south.
Objective: Bring 1 Arcane Resonator, 3 Lesser Moonstones and 10 Swamp Ooze Ichors to Magus Halister at Theramore Isle in Dustwallow Marsh.
