Title: Under The Sea
Description: Just look at it. A broken shell, nothing more. Do you even know how many years Dazlon and I worked to be able to afford our own ship, let alone this lucrative lifestyle? Probably not. Most definitely not.$B$BYou know, I had quite the fortune on that ship. Saved it from several trades and other more... unconventional practices. Nothing out of the ordinary for a gal of the sea, after all. I worked months, almost a year for this and now - all gone, sunken to the depths.$B$BI heard you are going to the wreckage for Dazlon. I don't have any hope you'll find it, but should you come across a green stash full of gold coins anywhere down there - I beg of you, bring it to me, please.
Objective: Find Ranala's Sunken Stash. If it is not on the wreckage, maybe the makrura have taken it. Bring it to her south of Black Ash Coalpits afterwards.
