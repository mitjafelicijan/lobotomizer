Title: Faelon's Folly
Description: Our fleet was accompanied by a squadron of high elf vessels. They traveled to the islands with us for a somewhat secretive mission. I had many friends within their crew whom I met from Kul Tiras. The high elves are a good people, but their leader, Faelon was a rather shady characterâ€”one who traded illegal goods and dealt with unsavory individuals.$B$BIt is sad to say that many of those people I once called good friends are now haunting the shores of Faelon's Folly on the island of Gillijim. They were slain by the Deeptide Naga, though one of the items Faelon coveted in hopes to trade now has left them restless.$B$BGo there and free the souls of the dead. You will find them on the western coast of Gillijim's Island south of Lapidis.
Objective: Travel to Faelon's Folly on Gillijim's Island and slay 7 Forgotten Swordsman, 7 Drowned Souls, and 7 Forgotten Crew.
