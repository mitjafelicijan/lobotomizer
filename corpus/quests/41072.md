Title: A Sentinel's Sudden Suspicion
Description: Ishnu-alah, $c. What a favorable event meeting you here. I was sent to Felwood to guard the Talonbranch Glade. However, druid Wildwalker sent me away. I suspect he believes me to be a spy. Ironically, he has now made me into one.$B$BI would like to know why he would object to being guarded, and sending another sentinel would give my concealed intentions away. Would you speak to Wildwalker and find out what is going on? Return to me once you have identified the intentions of his superiors.
Objective: Offer your services to the druid Yohan Wildwalker at Talonbranch Glade in Felwood.
