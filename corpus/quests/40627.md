Title: Unforgotten and Unforgiven
Description: I do not believe in coincidences, I do not. Hmm... I firmly believe in our desecration of the Northern vales, the centaur provoked a being of vengeance to menace us. Do you know of what I speak? Hopefully not, if you had seen or heard him, you would likely not be alive.$B$BI hardly expect you to do this, $N, but if you are equally brave and foolish, then seek Almaudrak to the north, just before the path opens to the fiery woodland vale. The winged horror stalks the road and makes nest in the western mountains.$B$BYou will truly be an honored name amongst the Gelkis if you can bring me his heart.
Objective: Find Almaudrak, slay him and return his heart to Yesu'gei at Gelkis Village in Desolace.
