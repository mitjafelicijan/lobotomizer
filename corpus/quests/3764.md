Title: Un'Goro Soil
Description: The soil of Un'Goro Crater is reportedly enriched with potent magical qualities.I want to know facts from falsehoods; go into the wilds of Un'Goro and acquire enough quality samples of soil for our continued study.$B$BYou may think that collection tasks are beneath you; that sort of attitude does not endear yourself to me or the Cenarion Circle.Bring the samples to Jenal, who is no doubt wasting time outside behind this tree; just look for the piles of dirt.He will handle the logistics - not I.
Objective: Bring 20 Un'Goro Soil samples to Jenal at the Cenarion Enclave in Darnassus.
