Title: Disruption at Black Ash Mine
Description: Our working operations at the Black Ash Mine have come to a complete halt. Not only are we having to look over our back for those Mudpaw Gnolls, now the Venture Co. are lurking around.$B$BI've been receiving some reports from some of the miners that they have seen a goblin command the gnolls on their attack at the Black Ash Mine. Head just to the north of here, and delve into the mine itself. If you find anyone related to the Venture Co. slay them, and then return to me.
Objective: Explore the depths of the Black Ash Mine to the north of Rustgate Ridge and seek out any affiliation between the Mudpaw Gnolls and the Venture Co.
