Title: The Scent of Lar'korwi
Description: I'm actually surprised he has not come for you yet, $N. But all is well, for I have a final plan that will bring the monster to us.$B$BBeing the dominant male gives Lar'korwi rights to breed with any female he chooses--and he chooses many of them. You'll find many ravasaur eggs to the west of here. Get close to them and you should provoke an attack by his mates. The females produce an awful smell from a gland in their heads that allow males to know they are ready to breed. Bring me two of those glands.
Objective: Bring 2 Ravasaur Pheromone Glands to Torwa Pathfinder near the entrance to Un'Goro Crater.
