Title: Sailors Innovation
Description: From our time at sea, it is us sailors who come up with the fine dining aboard ship. The same meals can get repetitive when you have them over and over again, so it is time to improvise and innovate.$B$BI came up with this recipe some time ago when we spent a few days on Tel'Abim. All we had were sand crawlers and bananas. Fry it up together and add a pinch of salt, then you have quite a meal! Sadly, we don't got bananas, but I do know that Chef Jenkel has some salt. Get the salt from him, and gather some legs from any sort of sand crawler around these islands, then I can finally have a change of meal.
Objective: Collect 6 Juicy Crawler Legs and a Pinch of Salt for 'Slim' in Caelan's Rest.
