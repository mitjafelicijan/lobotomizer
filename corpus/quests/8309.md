Title: Glyph Chasing
Description: After our initial foray into the hives and Mistress Mar'alith's subsequent madness the three hives have been spewing out bugs! The increased activity might be tied into the glyphs covering those strange crystals.$B$BWe must get a rubbing from crystals in all three hives. If we can get those rubbings, we might be able to make sense of this madness.$B$BTake this transcription setand hit those hives, $N. Don't come back until you've gotten copies from each hive.
Objective: Rutgar Glyphshaper at Bronzebeard's Encampment in Silithus wants you to venture to Hive'Ashi, Hive'Zora, and Hive'Regal and recover Glyphed Rubbings from the Glyphed Crystals of each hive.$B$BUse the Geologist's Transcription Kit to make a reasonable facsimile of the ancient glyphs. Return to Rutgar Glyphshaper when you complete this task.
