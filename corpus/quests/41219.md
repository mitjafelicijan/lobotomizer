Title: Wyrms of the Highlands
Description: As members of The Silver Covenant, our mission is clear â€“ to cleanse these lands of any perils that endanger the refugees seeking sanctuary. Among these threats, the burgeoning population of Mana Wyrms poses a significant concern. Their numbers surge as they feed off the mana employed in their vicinity, unsettling the balance we seek.$B$BI task you with culling their numbers and bringing me ten Mana Wyrm eyes as evidence of their demise. Not only will this act bring peace to these lands, but the collected eyes will also serve as catalysts to charge more mana crystals, addressing two issues in a singular endeavor.
Objective: Bring 10 Mana Wyrm Eyes to Commander Braedin in Silver Covenant Camp.
