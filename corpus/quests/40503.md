Title: Of New and Old III
Description: I haven't heard that name in some time, though I certainly remember it.$B$BKarfang fought with the Blackrock Clan during our invasion of Azeroth, and rose through the ranks quickly. From my knowledge, he was a strong warrior, though not as blood thirsty as others.$B$BThe Karfang I remember was smart enough to deny suicidal orders, or challenge leadership when required, I am not surprised he has lasted this long.$B$BKarfang can be trusted, he is certainly wise enough to see the doom of the Old Horde before him.$B$BThrall gives approval on my word take the Warchief's Response to Karfang Hold, we will see if he can prove his loyalties.
Objective: Bring the Warchief's Response to Karfang at Karfang Hold in Burning Steppes.
