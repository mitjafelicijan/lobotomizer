Title: The Glass Eye
Description: Beneath Maul'ogg lies a cavern system filled with basilisk, called Deepneck Cove, its entrance laying at the beach just to the north east. I have been having long nightmares of a great magical power during my sleep, as if something is calling out to me. A basilisk with an eye of glass and a mind of power, I have recognized its horrible appearance before.$B$BIt is this very magic that I search for now, and bid that you obtain. The magical gaze of a beast named Glasseye is the one responsible for my dreams, and the energy seeping beneath Maul'ogg. Travel into the caverns and slay the beast, collect its eye, and bring it to me, perhaps its magical potency will bring me some gaze into the future.
Objective: Venture within Deepneck Cove beneath Maul'ogg Refuge and slay Glasseye to claim The Glass Eye for Seer Borgorr.
