Title: Mastering the Formula III
Description: An idea has come to my mind, while you were busy helping! With these elements as a base, I have discovered that I require a more volatile aqua in the formula. With a more potent chemical reaction, it is theoretically possible to disperse the toxins from the air.$B$BNow that is compelling, isn't it?$B$BI have done the math, and all I require is a sample of Volatile Aqua.$B$BI have heard rumors of a rather hostile aqua elemental out near the Helm's Bed Lake in eastern Dun Morogh.
Objective: Gather a Volatile Aqua sample for Master Chemist Volterwhite at the Gnomeregan Reclamation Facility in Dun Morogh.
