Description: What a better way to cap off the end of a long year other than drinking? Of course, the best of the best only makes the celebrations better.$B$BYou heard tales of the Winter Veil Brew I made a few seasons past? Oh, it surely was magical, probably the best batch I made in my wee life.$B$BThose dastardly Dark Irons stole it, no doubt hidden away in their tavern deep within the Blackrock Depths.$B$BYou recover it, and I share some of it, that sounds like a deal, yeah?
Objective: Recover the Winter Veil Keg in the caverns of Blackrock Depths for Bomarn Fireaxe at Winter Veil Vale.
