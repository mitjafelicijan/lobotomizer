Title: Captain Grayson's Revenge
Description: This is Cookie's cookbook, it's how I taught him to understand our tongue and how to make a somewhat decent meal.$B$BI tell you, I am not sure if itâ€™s because he's a Murloc or not but he barely has a taste for flavor.$B$BI am getting off the sails here.$B$BThe night the ship sank, Cookie fled, leaving all of us to perish. I almost forgot!$B$BI guess my mind gets foggy nowadays, not that I still have a working brain or a consciousness, mind you.$B$BThat motherless Murloc must pay for this bloody mutiny. Bring me proof of his death and I will reward you handsomely$B$BPerhaps I will even be able to move on...
Objective: End Cookie.
