Title: To Wake The Ashbringer
Description: <Tirion inspects the orb in silence for a while.>$BBy the Light!$BThis pure essence, this raw energy of the Light, this is definitely Alexandros himself!$BHis dormant soul turned into this orb, but for what purpose?$BI can't wrap my head around this, but perhaps we can try to wake him up. Not sure that's the right choice of words here. But how can we even do that?$BSomething familiar might do the trick.$BListen $N. Saidan Dathrohan was one of the very first Paladins, a friend of mine and Alexandros, at some point he went insane. Which in these times prove to have been due to a certain demonic influence.$BWhen Renault killed his father, Saidan took the Ashbringer's Tabard as a trophy.$BAt the same time, if my information is correct, Baron Rivendare proudly wore Alexandros' cape as mockery.$BYour task is to venture into the Stratholme and find these items that once belonged to the Ashbringer. Take the orb with you, I am sure you will get a reaction. In the meantime I will try to wrap my head around this situation.
Objective: Recover Tabard of the Ashbringer and Cape of Alexandros from Stratholme.
