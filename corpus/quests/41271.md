Title: Restocking the Stockings
Description: Gah, you've come looking for the Maison Serendipity Winter Veil clothing too? Well, I'm sorry to say but you're a bit late. I'm completely sold out at the moment. That Rouge magazine just did an article about us and, well... I didn't expect such a rush.$B$BI need to get word back to the shop that I need a new shipment, but I'm not supposed to leave my post. Hey, judging by your clothing, you seem a well-traveled sort. If you could just run back to Undercity and ask them to send me more product? The atelier is in the Apothecarium, near the Enchanting shop. Just ask for Coco and let her know the situation. She'll fix this mess!
Objective: Travel to the Atelier Serendipity shop in the Undercity Apothecarium shopping area and ask Coco to send Ralph Jacobs a new shipment of clothes.
