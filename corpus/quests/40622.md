Title: Sympathy for the Dead
Description: You may think that a death is simply a death, $r. But that would be a foolish thought, a foolish thought indeed. To die in glorious combat, received back into the earth, this is a good death.$B$BHmm, I remember friends, good Gelkis, falling down as they trotted, poisoned by stings from Scoropashi. I have seen those laid to rest, picked apart by giant carrion birds. This is disgraceful, and I will not have it happen to any more of my tribe.$B$BProve yourself useful. Go out and kill as many of these creatures to the north as you can find.
Objective: Slay 8 Scorpashi Snappers and 8 Dread Swoops for Yesu'gei at Gelkis Village in Desolace.
