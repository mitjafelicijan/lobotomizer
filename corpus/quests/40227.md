Title: Conserving Stonetalon Peak
Description: Welcome to Stonetalon Peak, a place of harmony with nature, Keeper Albagorm has done well in maintaining the region despite setbacks. I have been working tirelessly for sometime in maintaining the wildlife around here, and I have been having some issues.$B$BThe Twilight Runners of the Peak have been growing more hostile with time, and I fear they may out hunt some of the other wildlife present here. I require from them a single Pristine Twilight Fang, which will be used to conduct research to find any sort of genetic problem, disease, or corruption that may be gripping the population.$B$BYou can find them about Stonetalon Peak, be quick.
Objective: Collect a single Pristine Twilight Fang for Conservationist Yalus in Stonetalon Peak.
