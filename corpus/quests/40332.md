Title: The Bloodsail Compound III
Description: Now that you've recovered the supplies we can turn our attention to other matters entirely. In Kalimdor we have a network of clients and contacts that we keep in touch with for all sorts of purposes.$B$BOne such contact is located within Steamwheedle Port and hasn't sent his delivery of goods yet. He goes by the name Jabbey and is a vendor there.$B$BI'd like you to head there and find out what the hold up is so that we can get it all to McCoy.$B$BYou can find Steamwheedle Port to the east of Gadgetzan in the deserts of Tanaris.$B$BNow, of course, make sure you keep it on the hush-hush that this is related to the Bloodsail.$B$BOh, and make sure to bring water, I hear it's quite dry there.
Objective: Meet with the Bloodsail contact named Jabbey in Steamwheedle Port.
