Title: Hints of a New Plague?
Description: <Quae begins to go through the folder.>$B$BThis IS interesting. Seems Apothecary Jorell has been working on some deadly experiments here at Go'Shek. Not sure what that has to do with Hillsbrad, but Phin wouldn't like it if we let it continue.$B$BWe had a run-in with some orcs while you were gone, and I'm not in good enough shape to help Kinelory. If you're up for it, she's going to need some protection when she goes down to the farm to steal whatever research Jorell still hasn't sent to Tarren Mill.
Objective: Speak to Kinelory.
