Title: Juicy Darkfang Legs!
Description: Say, since you stopped by how about we have ourselves a nice meal, it's been a bit since I've been able to enjoy my special recipe! I damn near hunted all the Darkfang in the area, so you'll have to venture further out into the swamp to go and get me some of their juicy legs!$B$BFive should do, the Darkfang spiders are practically everywhere in the swamp, but especially so around the Quagmire down in the south west.$B$BOh, and make sure they're extra juicy, I won't take no dang-nabbit unjuicy spider legs now, yahear?
Objective: Gather 5 Extra Juicy Darkfang Legs for "Swamp Eye" Jarl at Swamplight Manor in Dustwallow Marsh.
