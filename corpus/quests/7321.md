Title: Soothing Turtle Bisque
Description: Who says that the undead don't know anything about cooking? Take my secret recipe for Turtle Bisque, for example. I've known folks that would come back from the dead just to enjoy a bowl! Heh, heh...$B$BSpeaking of which, I haven't been able to make any lately.I used to head over to Lake Lordamere myself to hunt snapjaws, the nasty things, but I can't pull myself away from my work here.$B$BIf you bring me some Turtle Meat from the snapjaws and soothing spices, I'll show you how it's done!
Objective: Bring 10 pieces of Turtle Meat and some Soothing Spices to Christoph Jeffcoat in Tarren Mill.
