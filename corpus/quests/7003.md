Title: Zapped Giants
Description: I'm going to have to do something about the giants if I stay out here!They're certainly not good for business, now are they?$B$BI've been working on a variant of a gnomish shrinking ray, but I'm using superior GOBLIN technological advances in its construction!In an effort to avoid inconveniences for myself such as death, I'd like for you to try it out on any of the giants in Feralas.You should find miniaturization residue on them after you shrink them - bring me back some!
Objective: Use Zorbin's Ultra-Shrinker to zap any kind of giant found in Feralas into a more manageable form.Bring 15 Miniaturization Residues found on the zapped versions of these giants to Zorbin Fandazzle at the docks of the Forgotten Coast, Feralas.
