Title: Crawling for Meat
Description: Greetings! Your company is welcome. I am Inunquaq of Moa'ki Harbor. I find myself in this strange land after weeks of sailing.$B$BMy tale began when a Winter Tauren friend of mine known as Buniq visited my settlement in her canoe, she invited me to accompany her to the village of Taunka'le. But as I entered the canoe, a strong icy gust blew the rope out of Buniq's hands. Within moments a strong current had taken me out to the open sea!$B$BBuniq had the oars so all I could do was to desperately cling to the canoe and hope for the best.$B$BEventually the current took me here to this warm land that looks nothing like my home. Listen friend, the canoe had some provisions but I have finished them days ago. Would you please collect some meat from these shelled creatures nearby?$B$BWe have similar creatures in the far north, but I am without the tools and the knowledge I need to try and approach them, as far as I can guess they are edible. If you do so, I will be forever in your debt.
Objective: Collect 8 bunches of Crawler Meat.
