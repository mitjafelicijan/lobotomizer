Title: Gor'tesh the Brute Lord
Description: They're reeling I tell you! Our next strike must be decisive.$B$BThe brute lord, Gor'tesh, must be slain. More importantly, his head must be returned to me so that I may prepare the third phase of our attack on the Firegut ogres.$B$BBe warned, soldier, Gor'tesh rules not from Dreadmaul Rock but from a Blackrock orc structure to the west of Dreadmaul Rock.$B$BYour orders, then, are simple. Find Gor'tesh and chop off his fat head. Return to me when the job is done.$B$BSHUT UP, WINKY!
Objective: Find Gor'tesh, somewhere to the west of Dreadmaul Rock. Kill Gor'tesh and then take Gor'tesh's Lopped Off Head back to Oralius in Burning Steppes.
