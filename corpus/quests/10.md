Title: The Scrimshank Redemption
Description: Oh, this is just terrible!I sent out my top assistant, Junior Surveyor Scrimshank, into the desert southeast of here.That's an area we call the Gaping Chasm.Well, he's gone missing, and his last report had more of those weird bugs where he was.Could it be that they've infested two major regions of the desert now?$B$BI need you to head into the Gaping Chasm and look for Scrimshank, please!That... or at least find his surveying equipment.I fear that may be all that is left of the poor sod.
Objective: Discover the fate of Junior Surveyor Scrimshank, and bring either him or his surveying equipment to Senior Surveyor Fizzledowser in Gadgetzan.
