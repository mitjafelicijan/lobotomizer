Title: Clearing Nuisances
Description: You'd think as an assistant I'd be doing only half the work of the guy I'm assisting, but no! While everyone is drowning in work - including myself! - Gazzik is tinkering day in day out without a care in the world. I don't know what kind of backhanded deal he has struck with Rustgate, but it seems to be paying off!$B$BOn top of that, our supply routes are constantly interrupted by either slobbering gnolls or the local wildlife, delaying any work progress even further.$B$BYou seem capable enough, I guess. Go back over the bridge and get rid of anything that isn't a goblin!
Objective: Kill Ashfeather Scavengers and Blackvenom Scorpids for Fanzo Edgeline at Gazzik's Workshop.
