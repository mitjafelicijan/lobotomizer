All that you have done -- you must finish this now, not me.$B$BBlazerunner guards an artifact called the Golden Flame. It provides power more vast than anything else I have ever known, and it is dangerous in the hands of one with an evil heart.$B$BYou will want to bring others with you -- it's dangerous to go alone. Take this as my advice.
Objective: Travel to Fire Plume Ridge, south of Marshal's Refuge.$B$BFind Blazerunner and use the totem to remove his protective aura. Once he has been defeated, acquire the Golden Flame from the cave.
