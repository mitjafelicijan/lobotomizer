Title: Attack from the Inside
Description: Are you aware of how the plague designed by the Cult of the Damned works? No? Well, it doesn't matter. What you need to know is that I have made something similar, though not as powerful as the original one. This vial contains a plague that will severely reduce the life expectancy of the living who consume it.$B$BNow, that is the part where you, my dear, come in. I need you to head north, past the Whispering Forest, to a farmstead called Garricks Stead. There, you will slip a bit of this liquid onto the human's supplies. And make sure that there are no witnesses.
Objective: Poison 6 Grain Crates, and slay 10 Remnants Farmers and 7 Remnants Militia on Garricks Stead before returning to Duchess Grelda.
