Title: Keeping Secrets
Description: Our next course of action requires us to be more bold. If we are to deactivate many of the buried secrets of the lost city then we must gather a great source of Ley Energy to channel. Deep within the depths of Dire Maul my Highborne kin have been utilizing a great mass of arcane power. This arcane power from what I can detect is keeping a being of great evil contained. I believe they are using this being to feed whatever magical addiction they may be consumed by.$B$BVenture into the depths of Dire Maul, and slay this creature that is being imprisoned, it should hold Pure Ley Essence, of which we can use to direct a spell out into the buried city.$B$BWith the activation of the Ashan Stone, we will need to be quick, so do not waste time.
Objective: Travel to Dire Maul, and slay the great evil being that the Highborne are leeching energy upon, gather from it Pure Ley Essence, and return to Keeper Laena in Azshara.
