Title: Components for the Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe
Description: Return to Menara, tell her it'll take some time, but I'll make sure to come through for her... and you. Tell her to have you finish gathering the rest of your components--I should have the thread done by then. You can return and pick it up then.$B$BGood luck, $N. Oh, and say hello to Strahad for me while you're there. That old coot... putting a tower right there next to Ratchet... crazy.
Objective: Return to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.
