Title: Tesala's Word
Description: There is a shadow that lurks unseen in the forests of Teldrassil, a tainted air that hangs like an acrid pall over the seemingly pristine glades. It has twisted and corrupted my sisters, making them distempered and aggressive. Malos assures me his research may lead to a cure for my sisters.$B$BThe treant Malos speaks of I have seen meandering the forests below here, withered, twisted, and enraged. A haunting visage it possesses, its mind tainted by the very darkness that has touched my sisters. You should be able to find it walking along the eastern edge of the Wellspring Lake.$B$BGo and bring this news to Malos. I hope that I have been of aid to him in return for his kindness.
Objective: Return to Malos Lunarspear in Teldrassil with Tesala Whitefeather's information.
