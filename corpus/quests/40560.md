Title: The Betrayal from Within
Description: So it is true. My soldiers, who I thought unwavering in their loyalty, were deserters. I wonder how many more hide in our midst.$B$BFor now, let's review the information: Caldwell and Hallan were deserters. They killed Paval Reethe when he was questioned by the Horde. Did they do it just to spite the Horde, or... Did he know something...$B$BOnce again, our findings lead us to the deserters in the swamp. Well, I doubt that we could make them talk. They resent Theramore, perhaps more than they hate the Horde. Any mindless attack on their base will not provide us with answers.$B$BWe need to turn to magic. Forbidden magic. If we had something that belonged to Paval Reethe, we could commune with his spirit. It is a dangerous practice that many would consider unethical.$B$BIn this case, I feel the ends justify the means, and fortunately, we have his badge. Since he passed recently with unfinished business, his spirit may still be in Azeroth.$B$BGo to the Mage Tower in Theramore and explain the situation to Magus Halister.
Objective: Speak with Magus Halister at the tower of Theramore Isle in Dustwallow Marsh.
