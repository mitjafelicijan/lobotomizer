Title: Call of Water
Description: Long ago I followed some companions into the Hillsbrad Foothills. We defended ourselves from some tenacious humans who make their home there and we found ourselves in a small town the Forsaken had taken over: Tarren Mill.$B$BIt was there I found a most peculiar thing: in the center of town was a small well of fresh spring water. I'm not sure the plagued citizens of the town even realize its value--it's a small holy vestige in an unhallowed sea.$B$BBring me a sample of that water in this waterskin.
Objective: Fill the Empty Red Waterskin at the well in Tarren Mill and return to Brine in the Barrens.
