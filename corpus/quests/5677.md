Title: Arcane Feedback
Description: As much as I'd like to show you our own special teachings of the Light, it is not our place. Your place is back in Stormwind with your own kind, $N... for now. Believe me, I mean no offense. When you return to High Priestess Laurena in the Cathedral of Light you'll understand what I'm talking about--the time has come for your race to prepare you for the future; to separate yourself from others that follow a similar path.
Objective: Speak to High Priestess Laurena in Stormwind.
