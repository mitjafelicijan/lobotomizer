Title: Digging a Little Deeper
Description: <He massages his temples and looks awfully exasperated.>$B$BFrankly, I was not sure I had to spell it out so clearly. I want the best of the relics here. The real findings from the digsites. Not old pieces of pottery and... whatever these are. Go back to that digsite. Find their leader, for he will surely preside over the more prestigious treasures. Take, steal, whatever you have to do, to bring back something actually worthwhile to me.$B$BJust do be careful, I hear the lead archaeologist there is a rather powerful spellcaster. I am sure that is no trouble for one of your stature though, correct $n?
Objective: Recover a more valuable artefact from the leader of the Angor Digsite in the Badlands for Senator Ryedol in Ironforge.
