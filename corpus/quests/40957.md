Title: Into the Dream I
Description: I am Ralathius, a servant of the Green Dragonflight. It is unusual to find me outside of the Dream, but there is a pressing reason for my presence here.$B$BOur sacred realm has been tainted by an unknown darkness. This corruption emerged suddenly and without warning, spreading its foul touch throughout the Dream. Druids, dragons, and all denizens of the Dream are engaged in a valiant struggle against this insidious force, but we are facing significant losses.$B$BAmong those lost is Solnius the Awakener, a noble soul and one of Ysera's most cherished children. Solnius carried the responsibility of safeguarding our most sacred ritual, known as the Awakening. Yet, he has succumbed to the alluring whispers of the Nightmare, and now this sacred power rests in the hands of darkness.$B$BPlease, listen to my tale. He must be stopped at any cost.
Objective: Listen to the story of Ralathius.
