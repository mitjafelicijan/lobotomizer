Title: Toxic Horrors
Description: I've studied the sample you returned with, and while I can't say for sure, I believe it contains traces of toxic elements. However, the only way to know for sure is to gather some as a comparison.$B$BI believe that the Deadwood furbolg may be gathering these elements from other corrupted creatures in Felwood; in particular, the elementals living in the Irontree Woods, called toxic horrors.$B$BCollect a few samples for me to compare, but be careful -- it's very dangerous there!
Objective: Collect 3 Toxic Horror Droplets for Donova Snowden in Winterspring.
