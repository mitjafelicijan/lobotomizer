Title: Woodpaw Investigation
Description: Gnolls aren't the sharpest tools in the shed, but they will no doubt have some sort of documented strategy on their recent activity.If we were to find those plans, then we'd have a clearer idea of what is making them so worked up.$B$BI want you to head back to the Woodpaw and find anything that might resemble their battle plans.They have to have something; their attacks have been too coordinated to be done without them.Find them, and return to me when you have them.
Objective: Find the gnoll battle plans somewhere in the gnoll camps to the south of Camp Mojache.
