Title: Bijou's Belongings
Description: At night when this place is lightly guarded, I sneak around the city, taking notes and writing down anything I see that could be of some strategic value to the K.E.F.$B$BLast night, however, things went dreadfully wrong. I stumbled across a tripwire and set off an alarm. I stashed my recon gear and ran for cover! Unfortunately, I can't get back to that gear. They've doubled and tripled up the patrols! All that information is lost.$B$BGet my belongings back and I'll return to the K.E.F. peacefully.
Objective: Find Bijou's Belongings and return them to her. You recall her mentioning that she stashed them on the bottom floor of the city.
