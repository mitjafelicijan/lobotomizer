Title: Bandit Lord
Description: You look like someone who can get things done. I have a proposition for you. You see, I have been hunting a man by the name of Storn for a while now. However, he was always surrounded by his minions and was untouchable. But it appears that he had a falling out with his men, and he has since been in hiding.$B$BGood thing is that I know he is hiding in a cave close to Rogue Heights in the eastern hills of Tirisfal Uplands. The bad thing is that I need to wait for my client to get here, and she has a habit of leaving early if I do not meet her at her specific time. This is why I need someone to go and hunt Storn for me. So what do you say? You get me Storn's head, and I will split the reward for the bounty with you.
Objective: I need to find and kill Storn in the cave near Rogue Heights.
