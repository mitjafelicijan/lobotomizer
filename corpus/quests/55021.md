Title: Beyond the Walls
Description: So, Zuul sent you? He wants to leave Stonard, that's it?$B$BHeh, well I'll make you a deal $R. Zuul has been an obedient grunt, one that listens well and does well when called upon, it's the only reason I'm offering this. You do a task for me, and I'll give him leave for a few days.$B$BThe local wildlife has been a continuous thorn in our side. There is no other presence than the large beasts that dwell within the shadows beyond the light of our torches.$B$BI've had orcs go missing and not turn up late at night, and there is no doubt in my mind that the beasts outside our walls are responsible.$B$BClear out the area outside our walls of what you find: jaguars, spiders and crocolisks. Make sure to thin their numbers.
Objective: Kill 6 Young Sawtooth Crocolisks, 8 Sorrow Spinners, and 8 Swamp Jaguars, then return to Dispatch Commander Ruag.
