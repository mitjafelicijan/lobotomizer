Title: The Venture Co. Shakedown
Description: Howdy there, don't suppose you're looking to help out a goblin who has a deep need for revenge huh?$B$BYou see, I used to help out the Venture Co. back in my hayday, and honestly, it was a big mistake. They offered me the deal of a lifetime for my friendship, to supply them with some metal under the table for big profit.$B$BNow, I think its in a goblins blood to follow the smell of gold, but I was robbed, and hoodwinked.$B$BI put my butt on the line for those guys, and they up and haven't even contacted me since, I want you to give them a message, no one screws with Shizwackle and lives to tell about it.$B$BI do have a reputation to keep if I ever want to survive out here after all. Head up to The Sludge Fen far to the north, kill their Drudgers and Mercenaries, its with my metal they started this refinery there, maybe when they have less workers they will pay attention.
Objective: Travel to The Sludge Fen and slay 10 Venture Co. Drudgers and 10 Venture Co. Mercenaries for Shizwackle Tangrig.
