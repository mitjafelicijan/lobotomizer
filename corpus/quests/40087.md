Title: Crumblepoint Tower
Description: I have no idea how they managed to slip past our forces in Silverpine. These Worgen have come in great numbers! Without the tower in our control, our ability to monitor activity here is reduced, which is why I could use the help of an adventurer like you. Help us reclaim it.$B$BYou haven't run, yet, so consider me impressed. Good. Head over and kill those flea-ridden wretches.
Objective: Slay 6 Tirisclaw Ravagers and 6 Tirisclaw Shadowcasters at Crumblepoint Tower before returning to Volgrin.
