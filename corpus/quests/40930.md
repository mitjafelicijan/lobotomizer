Title: The Gilneas Lighthouse II
Description: Huh, now that you mention it, we did have a supply of old oil that lingered around here for some years. I hate to tell you but it was taken when the deserters left the city and went to found their camp in the quagmire.$B$BI have no doubts their purpose for the highly flammable liquid is nefarious. That or they desire to make some coins from the valueable liquid. There aint many active sources working these days.$B$BIf you want the oil, recover it from them.
Objective: Gather the Stolen Oil Shipment from the Deserter's Hideout for Dockmaster Lorman at Theramore Isle in Dustwallow Marsh.
