Title: To Eperius' Aid
Description: Ah poor Eperius, she ran like the lightning and kicked like a mule. Since her wound from our last encounter with ogres she refused to eat anything and I fear for the worse. Everything we tried has failed, but I have one last idea.$B$BI heard rumors about a magical grain, its taste so sweet and gives your horse enough energy to gallop from Stormwind and back. Alas the location of it was lost long ago and I don't have any leads on it.$B$BPerhaps someone in Refuge Pointe knows something about it, you should check there. While you're gone I'll make sure she is well comfortable, please make haste as I don't know how much longer she can last.
Objective: Go to Refuge Pointe to see if anyone has any knowledge about the magical grains.
