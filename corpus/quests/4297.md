Title: Food for Baby
Description: Sprite darters are omnivores--that means they eat both meat and vegetation. If your egg here's gonna hatch, we best be prepared. Some good eats for these little guys are flanks of meat, raw and juicy, believe it or not. I was never able to find out why, but it has somethin' to do with Elune's plan for the elves... maybe they were to be protectors or somethin', I don't know.$B$BI'll take care of the egg for now, why don't you get me some good Silvermane stalker flanks for 'em to eat when he's hatched.
Objective: Bring 5 Silvermane Stalker Flanks to Agnar Beastamer in Hinterlands.
