Title: Every Step Of The Way
Description: Doran sent ye, eh? Well, he is a close friend, that's fer sure. And he wants me to help ye with a feathered headdress, like our fledglings do?$B$B<Drakk is silent for a moment.>$B$BIf ye wanna do it the Wildhammer way, ye have to get the leather yerself, wouldn't be authentic otherwise, would it? Here's the deal - get me fifteen silvermane hides for me stock and I will make you a framin' from one of the finest leathers I have.$B$BWhat? Doran told ye, I owe him one? Don't worry, I'm doin' this for Doran, but ye still have to have the entire experience, ye kno'? We don't' wanna sugarcoat you or anythin', eh?$B$BHere, take this skinnin' knife, it isn't as hard as many would say, ye just have to carefully sever the skin from the meat and tissue. With all the slashin' ye adventurers do, I'm sure ye will get the hang of it in no time. Just try not to cut yerself, chum!$B$B<Drakk cackles and hands you the skinning knife.>
Objective: Bring 15 Silvermane Hides back to Drakk Stonehand in Aerie Peak.
