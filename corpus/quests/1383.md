Title: Nothing But The Truth
Description: I have just the right serum in mind. It will deal with the truth in precisely the way the truth should be dealt with.$B$BFor this concoction I will need several Shadow Panther hearts from the Swamp. I also require the enchanted fungus off of the Mire Lord who resides there. I am sure one as able as you, $N, can persuade him to part with some.$B$BNow the hard part will be locating a Deepstrider tumor from far-off Desolace. Very rarely the giants there become ill and a tumor forms.$B$BNow, off you go!
Objective: Apothecary Faustin at Beggar's Haunt needs 5 Shadow Panther Hearts, Mire Lord Fungus and a Deep Strider Tumor.
