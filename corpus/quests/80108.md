Title: Me Not Any Kind Of Orc
Description: We're in a tough spot. The boss is scary, but he ain't worth fighting hordes of ghosts or some ancient curse. When he finds out we bailed on this gig, he'll have us hunted to the ends of Azeroth.$B$BAs much as it pains me to say, we're gonna have to cower and hide behind some real muscle if we don't all want to end up six feet under.$B$BThere's only one force in Azeroth that even the boss wouldn't cross: The Horde. Sure, they don't like us, but we've got better odds with the Horde than with the boss!$B$BWe ain't got many choices. No one else would take a bunch of deadbeat Venture Co. refugees. If there's even a chance we can win them over, we've at least gotta try.$B$BIt's that or spend the rest of our lives on the run. Time for us to go straight, $N.
Objective: Join Nert Blastentom and travel to Durotar to join the Horde.
