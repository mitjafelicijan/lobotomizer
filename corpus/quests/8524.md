Title: The Alliance Needs Rainbow Fin Albacore!
Description: Hey there, friend! If I were to say to you, 'Don't you think that soldiers should have food to eat like anyone else?', you would of course reply, 'yes'. I agree with you 110%! I'm glad we're in accord. All I need for you to do is to head out there, fish up a whole bunch of raw rainbow fin albacore, and then cook it all up and bring it back to me right here. Mmm, mmm, I can taste it already.
Objective: Bring 20 Rainbow Fin Albacore to Slicky Gastronome at the Military Ward in Ironforge.
