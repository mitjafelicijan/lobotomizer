Title: Favor for Gelweg
Description: Hey, look I appreciate all you did for me with those scales, my higher ups at Shadowfor - Err, back out in the Eastern Kingdoms are going to be very pleased, and that pleases me!$B$BBut I just have one more favor to ask for you.$B$BDown to south you'll find a place called Southbreak Shore, it might be tricky, just a bit southeast of the Caverns of Time.$B$BAll along that coast are large Coast Striders, massive giants that roam the coast and call it home. Well you see, I need an eyeball from one of them, and I really don't think they'll give it to you, infact they probably will hate you for being there!$B$BSo, you go and gather a friend or two, get me an eyeball, and we finish our dealings, aye?
Objective: Gather a Sea Giant Eyeball for Gelwig Darkbrow at Steamwheedle Port in Tanaris.
