Title: Felstrider Retreat
Description: Our... former brethren have fortified themselves in the mountain fortress of Felstrider Retreat. They've been here even before we arrived to settle these lands, and I suspect they may be remnants of Kael's forces that did not sail to Northrend. Up until now, they haven't caused much trouble, and quite embarrassingly, we've been overlooking their presence. However, if what you say is true, they must be plotting something.$B$BI need you to find evidence of their plot. Perhaps one of their soldiers carries orders that could shed more light on the matter. May the Light guide you, friend.
Objective: Find proof of the Blood Elf plot in Felstrider Retreat.
