Title: Kalanar's Mallet
Description: Long ago I traveled the forests of Ashenvale in search of a place to call home. As the druids tended to The Crescent Grove, I figured such a tranquil location would make the perfect home. For centuries I tended to my garden and assisted the druids with whatever needs they had.$B$BAs of recently, a band of Furbolg calling themselves, the Groveweald, had moved in. They expelled me from my home and even had the audacity to burn it to the ground. In my panic, I left behind many valuable heirlooms and treasures. Without a doubt, most of it burnt to the ground.$B$BPlease travel to my burned down home in the Crescent Grove and gather from behind the house my mallet. It was given to me by my father, and I used to build my house. Collect it, for it means a lot to me.
Objective: Travel to the Crescent Grove and find the burned down home of Kalanar Brightshine. Then retrieve Kalanar's Mallet and return it to him in Astranaar.
