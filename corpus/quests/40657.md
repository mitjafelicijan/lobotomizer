Title: Scalebane Ridge
Description: <He throws up his hand to halt your approach.>$B$BThat is close enough. And speak quietly, lest you irk us with your prattle of adventure and questing...$B$BActually, I do have a request. Scalebane Ridge, heard of it? No? Lethlor Ravine, then? No? The Badlands? You are a truly a dense one...$B$BI need you to find the encampment known as Scalebane Ridge. It is a new base of operations for the Dark Iron Dwarves in that area, and their hunting of the whelplings in the area gives me a very bad feeling about what they could be used for. In any case, better safe than sorry. Head over there, and slaughter their hunters.
Objective: Slay the Shadowforge Dwarves in Scalebane Ridge, hidden within Lethlor Ravine in the Badlands for Senator Barin Redstone in Ironforge.
