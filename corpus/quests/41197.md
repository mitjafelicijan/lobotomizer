Title: Delivery to Alah'Thalas
Description: Heading to the city of Alah'Thalas, are you? If so, I've a task that requires your aid. My companion Tiriel has established an inn for the influx of refugees making their way to the city, and, as you can imagine, it's teeming with occupants. We've just received a fresh supply package from the Wildhammers, and it would be of immense help if you could deliver it to her. You'll find Tiriel's inn adjacent to the city entrance, the first building on your left as you traverse Anasterian Park.
Objective: Deliver the Wildhammer Supply Package to Tiriel Brightwater in Alah'Thalas.
