Title: Taming the Beast
Description: You have learned how to dominate beasts by your own skill, but you must also learn to train them. Understand that some beasts will not accept you as their master. As an undead being you may seem to them a delicious snack, or repulsive to their instinctive necrophobia.$B$BAided by an incantation devised by the Cult of Forgotten Shadow, we can soothe the mind of a beast, altering its perception of you as vibrant and healthy. Only use it on creatures that your condition repels, that are stricken with terror and distress by what you are.$B$BThe one who can teach you the incantation as well as the means by which to train your beasts is Diane Willowfield. You will find her in the War Quarter of the Undercity. You will gain a variety of potent skills on your journey that will serve you and your companion well, but without her assistance, you cannot hope to make proper use of them.$B$BGo now! Show the living that the Forsaken are no mere walking corpses. Dark Lady watch over you.
Objective: Talk to Diane Willowfield in the War Quarter of the Undercity to learn the incantation to tame beasts.
