Title: Shadowsworn Altar
Description: In the northwest corner of Blasted Lands, an old Altar of Storms looms over the wastes. Around it, elite soldiers of the Shadowsworn gather. I was never able to get closer to them, but with your strength, it should be an easy enough task. Kill them, and interrupt whatever they do.
Objective: Slay 10 Shadowsworn Warlocks, 5 Shadowsworn Enforcers, and 5 Shadowsworn Dreadweavers for Jaiymu in the Blasted Lands.
