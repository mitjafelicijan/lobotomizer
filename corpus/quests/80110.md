Title: Green Goes Red
Description: Nert is a good friend, and despite his choice of employment, I don't think he's a bad person. Convincing Gar'Thok of the same, though... And getting you all into the Horde? That's a tall order!$B$BGar'Thok may love my boar ribs, but I'd like to think he's got a better head on his shoulders than to recruit former Venture Co. crew in exchange for a meal.$B$BI'll cook these up for you at least. If you're set on this plan, take my advice: Tell Gar'Thok your lot are refugees willing to serve. Do not mention the Venture Co. at all.$B$BGive Nert my regards.
Objective: Bring Torka's Boarbecue Ribs to Gar'thok in Razor Hill and ask him to help you join the Horde.
