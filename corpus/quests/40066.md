Title: Repair the Fizz Disk
Description: The Turbocharged Wobble-free Fizz Disk must have fallen in a state of disrepair after I left. We did leave the control panel running. While this thing is durable, it's not durable enough to be under so much pressure for that long.$B$BI'm going to need this thing repaired, and with your help, I will surely do it! The list of materials required will be somewhat long, but I promise I will make it worth your time if you can get the items.$B$BI am going to need the following: 10 Thorium Bars, 1 Thorium Widget, 5 Iron Struts, and 1 Unstable Trigger.
Objective: Gather 10 Thorium Bars, 1 Thorium Widget, 5 Iron Struts, and 1 Unstable Trigger for Fendo Wobblefizz in Flaxwhisker Front.
