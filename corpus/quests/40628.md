Title: The Raging Oceans Blue
Description: I have kept one bit of information from all the tribe, save the Khan himself, $N. Even Uthek, for all her wisdom, I do not trust to not act rashly upon this.$B$BWhile we do not fish much, the seas provide life and nourishment to surrounding creatures... which we may in turn eat. We rely on her as much as the land, this suffering land, despite what others may think. Which is what it pains me to say, something has angered the elements of the deeps too. I can feel it, $N.$B$BI sense, far to the north, where the mountains overlook the sea. There is something roiling, raging, ready to enact vengeance for the suffering land, or perhaps some transgressions I am not aware of. This is something we cannot ignore, and it will panic the Gelkis if it becomes common knowledge! Our village is not miles from the sea after all. We are not great swimmers.$B$BFind a way to quell this being, and I promise, you will become an honored visitor in this village. Perhaps more.
Objective: Find and quell the elemental Yesu'gei speaks of, once complete, return to Yesu'gei, at Gelkis Village in Desolace.
