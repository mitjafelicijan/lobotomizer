Title: The Black Shield
Description: Hmm... I don't see anything out of the ordinary with this shield. We should have Do'gol, the blacksmith, take a look at it, and see if he can tell us more about it, but I wouldn't hold out hope...
Objective: Show the Blackened Iron Shield to Do'gol in Brackenwall Village.
