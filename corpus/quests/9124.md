Title: Cryptstalker Armor Doesn't Make Itself...
Description: How would you like to earn yourself one of these shiny coins?$B$B<Leopold holds up an insignia of the Crusade.>$B$BI've got a little problem that you might be able to help me with, $N. You see, I make Cryptstalker armor for those daft enough to venture into Naxxramas. While they supply me with the core material requirements for the armor, I always run out of the crypt fiend parts. Bring me back a bundle of parts and I'll pay you with an insignia - usable at the quartermaster.
Objective: Huntsman Leopold at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands wants 30 Crypt Fiend Parts.
