Title: Libram of Protection
Description: He wept like an infant at the loss of this libram. Mind you, I myself have wept over texts - there is no greater loss than that of knowledge and history - but to cry over this nearly useless jumbling of incantations? Preposterous! It left me to believe that the Prince was doing him a favor in flaying the flesh from his bones.$B$BBring the Libram along with a pristine black diamond, large brilliant shards, and a frayed abomination stitching and I shall recreate the Arcanum.$B$BOh, and check the north wing.
Objective: Bring a Libram of Protection, 1 Pristine Black Diamond, 2 Large Brilliant Shards, and 1 Frayed Abomination Stitching to Lorekeeper Lydros in Dire Maul to receive an Arcanum of Protection.
