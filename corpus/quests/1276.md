Title: The Black Shield
Description: Ah, I remember now! Mosarn is a well-respected blacksmith in Thunder Bluff. I knew I had heard his name somewhere, before.$b$bIn thanks, the Earthen Ring awarded me with a set of armor crafted by Mosarn. Very good work.$b$bPerhaps he can tell you more about the shield he crafted.$b$bIt's not much of a lead, but since we didn't get anything useful out of Reethe, it's all we have.
Objective: Show the Blackened Iron Shield to Mosarn in Thunder Bluff.
