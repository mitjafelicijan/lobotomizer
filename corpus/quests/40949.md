Title: One Chain at a Time
Description: It's ironic. I was about to say that I haven't been able to see the sun in so long, yet I grinned realising I have yet to see an actual Sunrise in Gilneas anyway, with all its fog and rain.$B$BI must be free of these chains. That harlot, Celia, convinced Father to send us away to Kul Tiras only to bind Tess and I, hiding us away from the world! I helped Tess escape, but they tossed me into this place.$B$BAid me, so that I may find my way towards my people, and so I may help them against the scum that took over my city and poisoned the mind of my father.$B$BGuard Captain Marson, that's the name of the brute that holds the key to my freedom. You should be able to find him around here. Perhaps lingering outside in the fresh air.
Objective: Slay Guard Captain Marson and gather the Rust-Covered Key to free Liam Greymane.
