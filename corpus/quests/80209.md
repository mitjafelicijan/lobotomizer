Title: Porting to Goldshire
Description: You've decided to assist, then? I am grateful, $N!$B$BThe situation back home is dire and we cannot return to help at the moment. I do not know what kind of affliction ails the Stormwind nobles, but ever since King Varian disappeared, the Kingdom has been run into the ground!$B$BAlas, while we can't control the nobles, we can deal with the problems in the kingdom's provinces! Elwynn Forest is a good place to start. The capital is located in this region, and it has been surrounded by issues. Kobolds rule the mines, gnolls raid the towns, and bandits seize the roads.$B$BMy friend Marshal Dugan is stationed in Goldshire, and he can put you to good use. I believe the Magistrix here can teleport you to Goldshire.
Objective: Speak to Magistrix Ishalah to be teleported to Goldshire, and then report to Marshal Dugan.
