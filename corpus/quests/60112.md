Title: Fallen Adventurers
Description: While I'm bound to fulfill Marla's wish, I cannot help but think about Samuel's friends. They are damned into eternal service for the Scourge with their bodies and minds beyond recovery. Please, if you see them... lay them to rest.
Objective: Novice Elreth has asked you to kill Karrel Grayves, Daniel Ulfman and Stephen Bhartec. They were last seen at a camp near Deathknell's gate.
