Title: Knowledge of Lorthiras
Description: Now then, mortal, it is time that we bid eachother goodbye. Once you let the magic I have given you flow from your hands, into the hammer that you will temper, it will no longer be of knowledge to you. I suggest you be careful in what you craft.$B$BI have felt a purpose about you ever since you first came, return to the one who sent you on this path. Inform him of your newfound ability, and you will be instructed of what to do next.
Objective: With your new found knowledge, return to Craftsman Wilhelm at Light's Hope Chapel.
