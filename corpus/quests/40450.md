Title: Repowering Chaser
Description: Say there, you wouldn't happen to know anyone that knows a thing or two about engineering, would you? We picked up Chaser from Southshore about a year ago now, from a goblin merchant infact. He's been great, but, slowly he's been breaking down, or getting kinda slow.$B$BI was told that he would need a backup Gold Power Core at some point, and I think that might be what the issue is. The problem itself though is that we're so far out here, and I don't really know much about engineering to craft one, or have the resources on hand infact! If you could get one, I'm sure Chaser would be quite happy.
Objective: Collect a Gold Power Core for Chaser at the Livingstone Croft in Arathi Highlands
