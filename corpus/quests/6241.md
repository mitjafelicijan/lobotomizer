Title: Winterfall Activity
Description: The Timbermaw tend to stay to themselves, $N. While we do allow safe passage to those that have proven they can be trusted, we try to avoid other furbolg tribes if at all possible.$B$BLately I have noticed that the Winterfall tribe has become increasingly hostile towards us. They seem to be in a state of rage, completely engulfed by their own fear and hatred of anything they do not understand.$B$BIf you could reduce their numbers this would help us greatly, $N.
Objective: Salfa wants you to kill 6 Winterfall Totemics, 6 Winterfall Den Watchers, and 6 Winterfall Pathfinders.
