Title: Draconic Presence?
Description: I have taken time to familiarize myself with the Font. I have come to the realization that the lingering magic is indeed coming from Gilneas City. In order to discover what type of magic, I require one last material in order to make it fully operational. I have my theories and suspicions based off the font itself that this could be draconic magic, and if so, perhaps Lord Prestor was indeed one taking humanoid form.$B$BTo fully know if this is the truth, I require you to travel to Dustwallow Marsh where the Black Dragonflight calls home. From the Firemane that linger at Dragonmurk in southern Dustwallow Marsh, recover a 'Potent Draconic Jewel'. It is often carried by their kind.
Objective: Slay Firemurk Dragonkin in Dustwallow Marsh, and recover a Potent Draconic Jewel for Magus Orelius at Ravenshire in Gilneas.
