Title: Southsea Reserve
Description: Oh, to be back on the sea... back on the sea and on the way home. It's been hell just having this part of the island to roam around on. The only thing we sailors have is ale and each other's company.$B$BRum is fine, but we've been craving more variety. This is where you're going to come in. The Southsea Pirates have been rather known for their own Southsea Reserve recipe, which only they can make. That is until you go and steal the recipe, and then we can make it ourselves.$B$BThey are currently holed up on a strand of sand called the Southsea Sandbar and the small neighboring patch of sand known as Distillery Island. It's practically a damn factory of the stuff. They have an entire trained crew working around the clock pumping this stuff out.$B$BIt's down in the southwest, off the coast of Lapidis Isle. You should see several of their ships docked there. The one who invented the recipe is named 'Moonshine' Marty. You'll get it from him.
Objective: Claim the Southsea Reserve Recipe from 'Moonshine' Marty for Sailor Larson in Caelan's Rest.
