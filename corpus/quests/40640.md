Title: Nazz's Got A Plan
Description: <Nazz reads the documents you brought him.>$B$BHoo boy, the Undermine at its finest.$B$BI remember those days. There is nothing worse than the Goblin nature, $N. The ones above will always work the other lot to death. And the other lot? They're trying to be the whip bearers rather than being whipped. Nothing worse, ain't NOTHING, NOTHING WORSE.$B$BThis is why the Union is a much better deal, most of us live equally, more or less. The Goblin nature applies here too, but in different ways and measures. Anyway, I got a plan.$B$BI need you to do what you do best, go out there, kill stuff, and bring the stuff back for money. Easy. Easy.$B$BAll across Stonetalon, they go by the name 'Raging Cliff Stormer' a huge lizard that shoots lightning. I need their scale for a shrink ray. Pretty much the electricity is what I need, the rest I am gonna ask some of our most "prestigious" engineers to make. Five of them will be enough!
Objective: Bring 5 Electric Scales back to Nazz at Powder Town in Stonetalon Mountains.
