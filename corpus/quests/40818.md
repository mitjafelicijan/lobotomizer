Title: The Key to Karazhan II
Description: Ah, so you have made the decision to seek the forbidden knowledge of Karazhan. I cannot blame you, for the allure of such power and secrets can be irresistible to even the most noble of intentions. Perhaps you seek this knowledge in the hopes of using it for the greater good of this world, and for that, I commend you.$B$BIf you truly wish to unlock the secrets of the Upper Chambers, you must first find Moroes, the cursed and undead castellan who guards the key to the forbidden section of the tower. It will not be an easy task, for he is cunning and fiercely protective of the secrets he guards. Be wary, as I do not know who the true master of Moroes is.$B$BBut if you can overcome his defenses and obtain the key, you may be able to enter the Upper Chambers and uncover the knowledge you seek.
Objective: Kill Moroes and retrieve the Key to the Upper Chambers. Moroes resides in Lower Karazhan Halls. Bring back the key to Lord Ebonlocke.
