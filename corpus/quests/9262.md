Title: Investigate the Scourge of Darnassus
Description: The Lich King has sent his undead upon our very doorstep; we cannot remain idle! Surely you will step up to defend Darnassus from these accursed invaders?$B$BThere are strange runic circles outside, glowing with the same energy that surrounds the undead and the Necropolis above. They have significance, I'm certain, and I want you to find out what. Thin the numbers of those aberrations while you're at it; bring me proof of their death along with your results, and I will reward you. Go!
Objective: Collect three Dim Necrotic Stones from the Scourge outside Darnassus and investigate the glowing runic circles nearby their encampment.
