Description: Did I mention the bad news yet? Its name is Maws: 100 feet of death and destruction. I guess I may have forgotten that little tidbit.$B$BAccording to my superior psycho-psionic clairvoyance, you'll find that the best spot to cast this buoy is off the coast of Azshara, in the Bay of Storms.$B$BLook for a swirling maelstrom, most likely cluttered with wreckage.$B$BBy the by, I hope you have friends.$B$BNow if you somehow miraculously succeed, take the scepter shard to Anachronos.
