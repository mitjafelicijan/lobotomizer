Title: Bubbling Baddies
Description: It is actually quite simple, really. With the energies within these orbs and your magical channeling, you will have a good enough magical shielding against its attacks.$B$BBelieve it or not, but powerful mages and sorcerers are able to conjure and dominate their own water elemental. Our knowledge and control over the elements may not be as deep and spiritual as one of a shaman, but that doesn't mean we can't do wonders with them too. So, who knows? Maybe one day you're waltzing into this place hitching a ride on one of them!$B$BTake the orbs and go north to the water hole. Once there, brace yourself and whack the elemental out of Durotar Labor Union property!
Objective: Quench the water elemental threatening the water pump and bring its shackles to Wizette Icewhistle at Rustgate Ridge.
