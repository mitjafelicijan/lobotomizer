Title: The Lost Dwarves
Description: The dig site at Uldaman wasn't always overrun.We Ironforge dwarves used to control the area, but... that was before the troggs came.They came so fast and in such numbers that not even dwarven might could stop them!$B$BIn fact, their attack was so sudden that I fear some of our people may be trapped behind enemy lines.$B$BMy friend Baelog led a small band of dwarves deep within the site just before the troggs showed up.If he and his company live, then I want you to find them.
Objective: Find Baelog in Uldaman.
