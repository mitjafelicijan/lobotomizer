Title: The Keepers Possession
Description: Many months ago, an object of great importance was lost to me. I was fishing along the coastline and studying the patterns of magic behind the tower, a storm had begun to set in, and was getting quite intense. As I packed my belongings and prepared to leave I was ambushed by both murloc and thrasher alike, in the chaos a chest was swept out into the sea.$B$BI may have defeated my foes but I could not find the chest, I could only assume it was washed ashore in the heavy storm. Check along the north western shore, it was where the current would take it, try and recover this chest.
Objective: Search the shoreline for the lost Eldara Chest.
