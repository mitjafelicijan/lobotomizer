Title: A Dwarf and His Tools
Description: Hey, $N. Be careful 'round here. There be Dark Iron dwarves all around--looked like the Shadowforge clan.$B$BThey just attacked the excavation site I was workin' at--killed nearly everyone there, including my boss Hammertoe. I barely escaped with me life.$B$BThe site's just to the north of here, and I'm tryin' to plan a way to get some of our supplies back, especially me lucky pick.$B$BThink you'd be up to helpin' me out some? One of those damned Dark Iron must have my pick! Could be anyone of them.
Objective: Find Ryedol's Lucky Pick and return it to Prospector Ryedol south of Hammertoe's Dig Site.
