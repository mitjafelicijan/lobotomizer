Title: How Big a Threat?
Description: Some of my brethren were rescued from a corrupt furbolg in Teldrassil, and I've vowed to stop any more atrocities before more of our kind are injured... or worse.$B$BI have seen a couple hints of corruption in Darkshore already, but I have yet to find any widespread signs. I think it would be logical if the investigation continued with the furbolgs. Would you find one of their camps, and return to me if you see any signs of corruption?
Objective: Find a corrupt furbolg camp in Darkshore and return to Terenthis in Auberdine.
