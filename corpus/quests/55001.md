Title: The Oil Stops Flowing
Description: Damned, blasted, stupid, good for NOTHING. Isn't this just great? It's one thing after another with that oil platform, and I'm a week behind schedule!$B$BIf you don't call havin' two workers get sucked into the ocean and your oil platform over-run by lobsters a nightmare, then I don't know where you're from pal!$B$BThe oil needs to keep flowing, and if the boss finds out that this has gone on, he'll have my head!$B$BMaybe I could blame this on someone, but first things first, get on over there and clear some of those blasted creatures so we can kick that baby into overdrive and start catching up on all the lost work!
Objective: Kill 5 Makrura Oilclaws and 5 Makrura Threshers at the oil platform east of the Port.
