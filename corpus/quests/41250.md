Title: Seek the Dryads
Description: I am quite pleased to be offered aid. Truthfully, I am here to help the Quel'dorei find ways to quell their torment. While I have been teaching many of them to meditate and try to limit their use of the Arcane, it is not a permanent solution. Some become Withered faster than others.$B$BSince I am not allowed to leave my abode, as my guardian—or jailer—would not let me go, I would ask you to go to the Sleeping Tree right in the middle of the island. It is there that you will find Rine, a Sister of Autumn, one I encountered while meddling about. The last time I was there, we had left one who was slowly turning into a withered to rest inside.
Objective: Seek Rine at the Sleeping Tree.
