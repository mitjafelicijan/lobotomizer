Title: To Strike Back : Ruins of Zul'Rasaz
Description: We have received information of a battle that took place in the troll city of Zul'Rasaz, or what is left of it anyway. Deep within the hills to the north, hidden away is a troll city, destroyed by conflict and time. It would appear the Witherbark fought and defeated the Wildtusk.$B$BGo there, and thin them out so that they cannot harm us down here in Stromgarde.
Objective: Travel to the Ruins of Zul'Rasaz and slay 8 Witherbark Rogues, 10 Witherbark Raiders, and 5 Witherbark Soothsayers for Troll Hunter Penthar in Gallant Square at Stromgarde Keep.
