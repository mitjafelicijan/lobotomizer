Title: Encrypted Scroll
Description: Ah, while you were off dealing with the mindless Scourge, this scroll arrived for you. I would think it's some matter of importance as it seems it bears the seal of the rogue trainer David Trias. I would take some time to read it before heading out again.
Objective: Read the Encrypted Scroll and speak to David Trias in Deathknell.
