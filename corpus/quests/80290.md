Title: The Lost Tablets
Description: With all that has been going around here, I could use help from an adventurer like you. You see, our people used magic to shape the land and create buildings like this, but this one appears to have been only partially complete and abandoned.$B$BI tried venturing inside myself but was immediately filled with dread and horror. It felt like it was consuming me, so I fled outside. But you, on the other hand, seem like someone who is not easily frightened. Before I... left. I noticed a Stone Tablet etched into the cliff.$B$BPerhaps it can provide some clue as to what might've happened here. Could you be so kind as to retrieve it for me?
Objective: Obtain the tablet within the unfinished building.
