Title: Brol'ok Ogre Bounty
Description: With all the troubles around here, I find myself having to turn to every mercenary with a sword to get things done. It's an unenviable position, to say the least.$B$BSay, I'm not paying you to listen, and you're not here to hear me talk. North of here, in their mounds, are significantly more ogres than I am comfortable sharing the area with. Go and relieve them of their heads. Bring me twenty, and I will organise payment.$B$B<He gives a derisive smirk before looking away.>
Objective: Bring 20 Brol'ok Ogre Heads to Sergeant Arbington at Ravenshire in Gilneas.
