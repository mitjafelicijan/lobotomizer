Title: Lighting the Oilmaster
Description: Right. While you were gone a friend of mine discovered the location of Higgle. And before you say it, yes, he's at the top of the stupid building. I had a hunch too, don't be a smartass about it.$B$BHiggle reminds me of our dark past bub, his stupid bossing around should end here. But, I know I am sending you on a pure suicide mission, you don't have to do it if you don't want to do it. But after all you've done, I am more than sure you will.$B$BKid, I'm proud I got an employee such as you. Stay on your toes, during your many, many trips to the oil fields they should be very alert right now. Humor this old Goblin, after Higgle's blood is spilled spare any who mean no harm, perhaps some of them will see reason and simply leave or seek a home in the union.$B$BWhatever your choice might be, do this one last job for me.
Objective: Kill Oilmaster Higgle Wirefuse and bring his head to Nazz at Powder Town in Stonetalon Mountains.
