Title: Contribution to the Church
Description: What is it that you want; sanctity, great knowledge? You will not find these things here, for the great arcane power of the wizard Medivh has doomed me and my flock to a life of eternal, drifting torment.$B$BWe are trapped, to forever wander where we remained in life. Though there is a possibility to transition to the great beyond, and such a task requires a great excess of arcane energy.$B$BIf you can gather me arcane materials, I can offer you the invocations I was famous for years ago. Sound like a good proposition?
Objective: Gather 15 Arcane Essence, 20 Illusion Dust, and 10 Greater Eternal Essence for Heirophant Nerseus at the church outside Karazhan.
