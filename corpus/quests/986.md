Title: A Lost Master
Description: $N, your skills have already helped me in my endeavor. Could I impose on you again to help Grimclaw and his master Volcor? In addition, I can craft you a magical cloak that will allow you to walk unhindered by Darkshore's creatures while you look for him.$B$BTo create the cloak, I'll need five fine moonstalker pelts from a moonstalker sire or matriarch to have enough material. The cats can be found near Wildbend River to the south, or even farther south near Ashenvale.
Objective: Find 5 Fine Moonstalker Pelts and return them to Terenthis in Auberdine.
