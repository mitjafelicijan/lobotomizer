Title: Simple Letter
Description: I was asked to bring this to your attention as soon as you returned from the kobold camps, $N. It appears to be a letter sealed with the insignia of Llane, our local warrior trainer. I wouldn't hesitate to read it before you go about any other business here in the Abbey.
Objective: Read the Simple Letter and speak to Llane Beshere in Northshire Abbey.
