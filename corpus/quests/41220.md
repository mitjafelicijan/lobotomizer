Title: A Feast for the Poor
Description: Welcome to Ballador's Chapel, a haven for those who seek solace in the Light during these challenging times. Even in the absence of the Sunwell, its radiance continues to grace us from the heavens.$B$BMight I impose upon you for a small favor, dear friend? In our efforts to host a feast for the impoverished of Quel'Thalas, we find ourselves in need of additional sustenance. While the noble families have generously contributed, there remains a shortage of food.$B$BI've been informed by the rangers that Stallhorn Stag meat is particularly delectable, and personally, I have a penchant for the taste of Crimson Hawkstrider wings. If you could procure a dozen of each, we shall orchestrate a feast that will be remembered for ages.
Objective: Bring 12 Chunks of Stallhorn Meat and 12 Crimson Hawkstrider Wings to Taliren in Ballador's Chapel.
