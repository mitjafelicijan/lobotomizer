Title: South Seas Delicacy
Description: Crab legs - they are such a delicious thing. They go well with everything! Undermine Claw Chowder, Goldthorn Tea, and even other crab legs! Maybe you're strong enough to catch them and get the crab legs I need?$B$BYou can find them at the Wild Shore which is directly south of Booty Bay. Be careful, though. I heard the shore got invaded by Bloodsail Buccaneers. That would explain why my supplier stopped coming.
Objective: Bring 10 Southern Sand Crawler Legs to Innkeeper Skindle in Booty Bay.
