Title: The Ancestral Amulet
Description: As we fled the chaos of Zul'Rasaz, many of my people had to leave behind cherished belongings and other items that had personal value. I am no different. I am ashamed to say that I abandoned an amulet that has been passed down in my family for generations, since the time of the last great empire.$B$BIt plagues my mind, $c. The spirits will never answer my call again should I not make up for this great shame. You must retrieve it for me! The ruins of Zul'Rasaz can be accessed by the trail outside of town to the northwest. My home is near the top of the ruined city.$B$BI would make the journey, but I cannot risk my life for such a selfish reason. You will be rewarded for your help, I assure you.
Objective: Find Yin'dos necklace in the Ruins of Zul'Rasaz.
