Title: The High Wilderness
Description: Although it is dangerous, Troyas and I have been investigating the ruins that cover the forests of Feralas.$B$BLately, though, Troyas has been going on his own to the High Wilderness, and I really worry about him. The Gordunni Ogres have taken over that area, and they don't take kindly to anyone that enters their territory.$B$BI was hoping you might be willing to travel to the ruins to the southeast and clear out some of the ogres. Make it a little safer for my Troyas, and I will be extremely grateful.
Objective: Angelas Moonbreeze wants you to kill 8 Gordunni Warlocks, 8 Gordunni Shaman, and 8 Gordunni Brutes.
