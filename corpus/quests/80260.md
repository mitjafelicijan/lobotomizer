I was APPARENTLY the most qualified to take care of her, but I'd appreciate it if you helped her out with her pleading because of your proclivity for being a “hero”.$B$BYes, yes! I will pay you, too, if those are part of your terms.$B$B<Anu'delen pinches the bridge of his nose while veins on the side of his neck flare into view.>
