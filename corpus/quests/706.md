Title: Fiery Blaze Enchantments
Description: As an apprentice to Feranor Steeltoe, I learned his special technique for imbuing weapons with fiery enchantments. Last I heard of him, he was working at a smithy with a hunting party up in Lordaeron.$b$bI can't tell you too many of the details about the process, but I can tell you it requires blood from a rare, still-beating black drake whelp's heart. I don't have much to do waiting for word from Ironforge. If you bring me a heart from the whelps in Lethlor Ravine, I'll show you my skill!
Objective: Acquire a Black Drake's Heart for Sigrun Ironhew.
