Title: The Cliffspring River
Description: The Cliffspring River has begun turning foul and corrupted.It empties into the Mist's Edge, and I fear the wash will affect Auberdine soon.I suspect the Blackwood furbolgs up-river are the cause of the taint, but I also suspect that they aren't the true root of it.$B$BTake this sampling tube and go to the mouth of the river to our north.Proceed inland to the first waterfall and draw a sample from the pool there.You'll see a bridge overhead.Once you have a sample, return to me in Auberdine.
Objective: Travel north of Auberdine to the first waterfall along the Cliffspring River and draw a sample from the pool there.$B$BReturn to Thundris Windweaver in Auberdine with the Cliffspring River Sample.
