Title: The Tower of Althalaxx
Description: The writing of the orcs is little better than the scribblings of a child. Many of my order scoffed when I chose to learn their tongue, but I have found it beneficial to gain further understanding of my enemies.$b$bFrom Ilkrud's scribblings, it appears that Athrikus still possesses two soulgems, and they are being held in Night Run and Satyrnaar, satyr-held areas in northeast Ashenvale.$b$bBe careful out there, $n, the satyrs' blood-soaked temples can be unsettling even for a seasoned $c such as yourself.
Objective: Free the trapped Highborne souls in Night Run and Satyrnaar, then return to Delgren the Purifier at Maestra's Post.
