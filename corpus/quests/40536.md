Title: Bond Through Battle
Description: Now that you have the meat, it is time for the actual test. This will prove if you are capable enough to be gifted a wyvern cub which will become your most trusted companion.$B$BTake this meat to Sunchaser, he is one of the Wyvern Alpha and my most trusted friend. Note that this will not be a gift, but a challenge. Presenting yourself in front of the alpha with the hunted game is disrespectful, Sunchaser will know you seek one of his cubs and by presenting the meat you will imply that you can be as much of a guardian as he can, and he will test that himself.$B$BHe will not kill you, probably.
Objective: Feed Sunchaser and defeat him in battle, once complete, return to Trainer Tokala at Red Cloud Roost in Mulgore.
