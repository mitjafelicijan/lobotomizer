Title: Dragonkin Menace
Description: Life in the Burning Steppes is rife with conflict.$B$BJust look at this place! We know very little of what happened to these buildings, but we do know that at one time, before the great explosion, this was all part of the Redridge mountain range.$B$BEnough lamenting! We have a problem, $N. You may have noticed the dragonkin below this ridge. We need assistance in pushing them back. Kill as many as you can and return to me. Succeed and perhaps we can talk of other things.
Objective: Slay 15 Black Broodlings, 10 Black Dragonspawn, 4 Black Wyrmkin and 1 Black Drake. Return to Helendis Riverhorn when the task is complete.
