Title: Maxwell's Mission
Description: This information fills in the gaps to our otherwise impeccable intelligence of Blackrock Spire.$B$BThe attack must be decisive, $N.$B$BFirst their war master, the troll Voone, must be destroyed. Without his battle plans, the Blackrock orcs will be thrown into chaos.$B$BYou must then take out the ogre Highlord, Omokk. The cowardly ogres of Blackrock are powerless without his leadership.$B$BLastly, the overlord of the citadel: Wyrmthalak. With Wyrmthalak dead, their central command unit is without a conduit.
Objective: Travel to Blackrock Spire and destroy War Master Voone, Highlord Omokk, and Overlord Wyrmthalak. Return to Marshal Maxwell when the job is done.
