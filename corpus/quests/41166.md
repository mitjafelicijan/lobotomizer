Title: Redistribution
Description: By any chance, did you help Copperlight down in the coalpits with his machine mayhem? He's been requesting some parts for additional modifications on his creations.$B$BWhat he wants is sadly not here in my storage, but Gazzik in his workshop is due to send a new shipment up to Rustgate Ridge. He can be a bit on the slacking side of things, but there is no one else like him on this island, so Taxxlo turns a blind eye to his shenanigans.$B$BHis workshop is to the southeast, across the makeshift bridge. Gazzik can tell you where the shipment is; once you have it, bring it to me.
Objective: Bring Supplymaster Maxlo at Rustgate Ridge the Crate of Rebalanced Frameworks from Gazzik's Workshop.
