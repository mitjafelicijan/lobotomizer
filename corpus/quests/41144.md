Title: Rite Of Passage
Description: Ye kno', we Wildhammers weren't always 'ere in these wild lands. We used to live underground, just like our fair brothers, the Bronzebeards. I have never seen our great city of Grim Batol, but me grandfather Bemoth told me stories about it in front of the hearth.$B$BYe can't say that the Wildhammers from the past are the same than the current ones, they're just differen'. Sure, some traditions took over, but we also made new customs, more fittin' fer us gryphon riders.$B$B<Doran looks you up and down and hesitates for a bit.>$B$BInterested in learnin' about 'em, eh? 'ere, lemme show ye.$B$BYoung Wildhammer are s'pposed to make their own headdress out of feathers before turning of age - as a rite of passage, if ye will. If ye wanna make ye own, get some feathers from the owlbeasts roaming the Hinterlands. Don't forget to get different colours, me friend.
Objective: Gather 10 Red Owlbeast Feathers, 10 Black Ownbeast Feathers, and 10 Brown Ownbeast Feathers from the ownbeasts in the Hinterlands for Doran Steelwing in Aerie Peak.
