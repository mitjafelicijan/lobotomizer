Title: "Pretty Boy" Duncan
Description: My FATHER sent you? I'd have thought that old codger would have given up on me by now.$b$bIt wasn't really his fault I ran off, he just shouldn't have expected I'd be willing to live a boring life, reading over musty books and associating with grey-haired, stiff-backed, stuffy mages!$b$bIf you need my dagger, you'll have to get it back from "Pretty Boy" Duncan, one of the Bloodsail Buccaneers. Put something 'tween his shoulders and I'm sure he'll give it up.
Objective: Get Catelyn's dagger from "Pretty Boy" Duncan.
