Title: In Search of Menara Voidrender
Description: Hmph, still you strive to become more powerful. I say it's only time before the corruption and addiction takes hold of you and you become a slave to that which you seek to gain power over.$B$BPfah! A fool you are! Time will prove me right--nothing else... just time.$B$BBut it seems that not all agree with Zevrost. It seems Menara would create tools for you to become more powerful and to harness your strength. If you're interested, then go to Ratchet in the Barrens. She is there overlooking the town.
Objective: Speak to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.
