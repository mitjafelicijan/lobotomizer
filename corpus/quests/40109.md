Description: Four years ago, my own people betrayed me for refusing to do the very same thing that doomed us in the first placeâ€”drinking the blood of the demon Mannoroth. If not for my companion Korvir and Truthseeker, my body would have rotted away in the forests of Ashenvale.$B$B<Logrash caresses the scars on his chest with a painful expression.>$B$BThe spirits whisper of demon scum called Naxiar hiding around the eastern lakes of Ashenvale.
