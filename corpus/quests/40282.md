Let's see.$B$B<Pierce produces an old scroll from within the belongings.>$B$BThere you are. Hah, it is easier to do than I thought. You will need to take these instructions to Duchess Grelda as her blood is required to open the box. I heard that the Duchess is currently residing in a manor alongside the southern road from Tirisfal Uplands. Be well, and if you ever feel like you want to delve into another dangerous place to recover old magical items, do let me know.
