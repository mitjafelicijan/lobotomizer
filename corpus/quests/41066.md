Title: Scythe of the Goddess
Description: I was gifted the Scythe at the Shrine of Mel'Thandris. Its ability to summon worgen helped me to turn the tide in the fight against corruption of Felwood. Yet, I was losing control of them. I needed help.$B$BI departed from the forests of Ashenvale with a purpose in mindâ€”to seek counsel from the wizard Arugal, who too had called upon the worgen.I yearned to understand the connection between these creatures and the favor bestowed upon them by Elune.$B$BBut... Arugal... dead? Elune's tears, the news strikes me with sorrow. In this moment, there is only one person we can turn to, one who possesses the wisdom and knowledge to guide us further. Arch Druid Dreamwind, a scholar of the otherworldly, may hold the key to unraveling the mysteries of our realms and beyond. Seek him out, and recount to him the tale that has befallen me. When I departed Kalimdor, he stood at the forefront of the efforts to heal Nordrassil.
Objective: Find Arch Druid Dreamwind in Nordanaar.
