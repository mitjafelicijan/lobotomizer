Description: Think you can match wits with Daryl the Bold, huh? I should think not! Of course, you're more than welcome to try. Here's a challenge that should prove to be above your abilities, so don't feel too bad if you can't face up to it.$b$bA flock of buzzards has nested here in Loch Modan. Why don't you try to take down some of the beasts? Tell you what, if you meet my challenge in fifteen minutes, I'll give you my bow or gun.$b$b<He looks you over dismissively.>$b$bIt seems you haven't much to lose, anyways.
Objective: Kill 6 Mountain Buzzards and return to Daryl the Youngling in the Farstrider Lodge within 15 minutes.
