Title: Grizlik's Wish
Description: <Little Grizlik presses his knuckle to his chest.>$B$BLok'tar, $R! I'm Grizlik, son of the Horde and future warrior of Orgrimmar!$B$B<The child flexes his scrawny arms, he almost seems cute.>$B$BHey, don't laugh at me! Come on, I've got a long way to go but the matron says if I put my mind to it, I too will have a big axe like the High Overlord, or who knows maybe shoot lightning like the Warchief!$B$B<Grizlik mimics a spell with his hands.>$B$BPew, pew!$B$BAnyway, you seem like a boring elder, you won't play with me, right? Can I ask you for a favour? Please take this to Torm Ragetotem in Thunder Bluff. When he was here last time, he brought us toys and taught me how to use a wooden axe!$B$BTake Squeaks with you too, he wants to see Thunder Bluff. You can keep him, he's more the adventuring type anyway. I'd be sad to keep him around forever if he wants to see the world!
Objective: Take Grizlik's letter to Torm Ragetotem in Thunder Bluff.
