Title: Digging Through the Ooze
Description: On my weekly visit to Ironbeard's Tomb I was attacked by dreadful, dripping oozes! Naturally, I panicked.$b$bI threw my bag at one, but it didn't do anything! The ooze just sucked it right up... Luckily, it did give me enough time to get away.$b$bThe bad news is that I really need to get the contents of my bag!$b$bI don't know which ooze I threw my bag at; they all looked the same! Ironbeard's Tomb is northeast of here, near Dun Modr. Thank you so much!
Objective: One of the oozes at Ironbeard's Tomb has Sida's bag, retrieve it and bring it back to her in Menethil Harbor.
