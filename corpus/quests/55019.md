Description: My brother has recently been dispatched out to the far reaches of our strength and posted within the encampment of Stonard.$B$BIt's not for me to question the Warchief's desires but I still do worry for my bother's safety out there, even if he is strong and good of health.$B$BIt has been months since we have last seen one another with all of the deployments, from one to the next, and now the Swamp of Sorrows of all places?$B$BThe only thing that has me at peace is that he had been promoted to a position of some power within the garrison there.$B$BIt's good knowing that maybe he is not on the very frontlines and is instead commanding his men.$B$BIt's an odd thing to watch a younger brother become more important then you but, well, duty calls and we must all do our part.$B$BPlease find Zuul within Stonard in the Swamp of Sorrows and deliver him this letter.
Objective: Deliver Rugnar's Letter to Zuul in Stonard.
