Title: Malfunction Mayhem
Description: Greetings! I am Cassie Copperlight, a gnomish tinker. I find myself in a bit of a bind, you see: a recent batch of bad data membranes from Tinker Town has caused a catastrophic failure in many of the Servitors in the lower levels of the Reclamation Facility. I may need your help.$B$BYour task is to venture down into those lower levels and destroy the malfunctioning Servitors. Additionally, I need you to retrieve any spare parts lying about so that I can build functioning replacements. Around seven should do. It won't be easy, but with your skill and bravery, we can fix this problem and prevent any further damage.
Objective: Slay 10 Malfunctioning Servitors and gather 7 Spare Parts for Cassie Copperlight at the Gnomeregan Reclamation Facility in Dun Morogh.
