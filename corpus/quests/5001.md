Title: Bijou's Belongings
Description: Ordinarily I don't deal with $rs but it seems that I'm stuck between a troll and a hard place. You see, my mission here is one of utmost importance to the Horde. The information I've discovered, however, applies to the well being of the Alliance as well. Now believe me, I'm no Alliance sympathizer, but the Blackrock threat is bigger than just a bunch of orcs.$B$BYou help me out by finding my belongings and I'll help you out with some information that could prove useful to your kind.$B$BDeal?
Objective: Find Bijou's Belongings and return them to her. Good luck!
