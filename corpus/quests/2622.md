Title: The Missing Orders
Description: The orders? What could you possibly want with the orders?$B$BWhat are you implying, $N? Of course I relayed those orders! The soldiers I sent the orders with were ambushed and brutally beaten by murlocs. Only one survived, if you can call that surviving. He can hardly speak, cannot walk, and must be fed through a tube. If you want to know what happened to those orders, speak with Bengor. I'm sure he is around here somewhere... and, $N, be mindful of what you stick your nose into - it may get bitten off.
Objective: Speak to Bengor.
