Title: Collection of the Corrupt Water
Description: Deep within Jaedenar lies Shadow Hold--the main fortress of their corruption and evil.$B$BThe Shadow Council has protective spells surrounding their lair in the form of braziers. If I am to find out any more information about our enemy through scrying, then those braziers must be extinguished. By doing so, I should be able to spy on the Council and find out who leads them.$B$BIf you can, take this canteen and fill it at the Moon Well in the center of Jaedenar. Return to me afterwards.
Objective: Take the Empty Canteen to the Moon Well in the center of Jaedenar and fill it before returning to Greta Mosshoof in Felwood.
