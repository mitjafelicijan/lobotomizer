Title: Corruption of Earth and Seed
Description: Deep in Maraudon lives an evil creature of chaos--Princess Theradras is an elemental force of earth related to the Old Gods. Ages ago, she and Zaetar, first son of Cenarius, began a relationship. The offspring of their time together became known to the people of Kalimdor as centaur. Ever-thankful creatures, the centaur killed Zaetar, and now hold Zaetar's remains. My quest here is to find those powerful enough to slay Theradras so we may recover Zaetar's remains before returning to Stonetalon.
Objective: Slay Princess Theradras and return to Selendra near Shadowprey Village in Desolace.
