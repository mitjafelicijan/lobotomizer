Title: The Final Test
Description: So, it appears some of these materials are not exactly cooperative with what I am trying to do, that said I think I may have figured it out!$B$BIt appears that Dream Dust, with the Banana, and some arcane energy could indeed produce what it is we are looking for. All I need to do is one final test to make sure everything works properly, so stand back, and speak to me after the experiment.
Objective: Wait for Tazzo Gearfire fo finish his experiments at Tazzo's Shack in Tel'abim.
