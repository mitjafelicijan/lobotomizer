Title: The Will of Lorthiras
Description: My time here within Shadowbreak Ravine has been a period of thought, and research. I desire to gain knowledge within the fields of magic of the various factions on Azeroth, and see just how far they have come.$B$BAs much as I could infiltrate, and spend effort to gain access to each through time, to sow desent, and chaos, I would much rather recruit you, to do as such for me. If you truly desire to gain knowledge to temper this Runeblade, I will grant it to you temporarily.$B$BFirst, travel to the Upper Blackrock Spire, and from the Rage Talon Fire Tongues, gather me a Rage Talon Charm, Secondly, travel to Dire Maul, from the Ogre Mage-Lords bring me a set Gordok Beads. Finally, from the pits of the Blackrock Depths, gather from a Doomforge Arcanasmith their Doomforge Rod.
Objective: Gather a Rage Talon Charm from Upper Blackrock Spire, Gordok Beads from Dire Maul, and a Doomforge Rod from Blackrock Depths for Lorthiras in Shadowbreak Ravine.
