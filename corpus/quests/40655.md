Title: Scaling the Ridge
Description: I am sure it goes without saying, I have no great love for little young creatures. I have nothing but contempt for humans, for example, and their little pets.$B$B<He sneers beneath his mask.>$B$BBut I have recently been made aware of an encampment in Lethlor Ravine, and the skinned corpses of countless whelplings thrown into the sun to rot. The Dark Iron Dwarves once again. Now, why would anyone set up a guarded camp to slaughter whelplings and drakes, if not to harvest something important? I do not particularly care what they hope to achieve, but if we strike now before they are more fortified, we will cut off this venture at the knees.$B$BFind this base of operations, and slay the dwarves you find within.
Objective: Slay the Shadowforge Dwarves in Scalebane Ridge, hidden within Lethlor Ravine in the Badlands, once complete, return to Lexlort in Kargath.
