Title: A Call to Aid
Description: An outsider, you're the first in quite a long time, welcome to The Remnants Camp. To state that our situation is bad would be an understatement of the highest regard. We are all that remains bearing the crest of Lordaeron as a sigil, tucked away within a remote corner of the Uplands.$B$BAs the leader of the Remnants, and the commander of the Army of Lordaeron I would ask a favor from you. I have prepared a letter to be sent to Stormwind, one of the final bastions of human power. Take it to General Marcus Jonathan, Lordaeron demands soldiers, and supplies.
Objective: Deliver Captain Silas' Letter to General Marcus Jonathan in Stormwind.
