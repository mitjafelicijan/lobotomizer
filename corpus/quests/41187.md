Title: Refugees no More
Description: Oh, by the Sunwell, another caravan? It feels like the very ground beneath us is groaning from the weight of weary travelers. There's scarcely enough space to catch one's breath, let alone find a place to rest.$B$BPlease, find a small patch of ground, any corner will do, and try to make it yours, at least for now. Unpack your belongings, as meager as they may be. It seems as if we're all carrying the weight of shattered lives in our hands.$B$BTake a moment to collect yourself amidst the chaos. And look, there's Commander Anarileth, over there, orchestrating what little order we have left. She seems to be in need of capable souls, and by the look of you, resilience marks your spirit.$B$BApproach her when you can, offer your aid. May the Light guide us through these dark times.
Objective: Report to Commander Anarileth in Brinthilien.
