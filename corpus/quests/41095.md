Title: Saving the Shadowtooth
Description: Mon, I be having an issue unrelated to demons. It be my tribeâ€¦ Most of them have gone mad. It happened when our Speaker was contacted by a Loa in a dream and told to fashion a Mojo of the Dreams using water near the Emerald Sanctum portal. I was fighting the demons at the time, but when I returned, my own tribe attacked me and referred to themselves as the Shadeflayers. Madness has overtaken them, but I believe my people can be saved if the source of the corruption is expunged. Slay Warlord Hanzento, the one who started this evil, and Find Speaker Gan'hota, it is him who has this Mojo of Dreams. You can find them both in Zul'Hatha in western Hyjal.
Objective: Slay Warlord Hanzento in Zul'hatha and bring the Mojo of Dreams to Shadowhunter Trak'nal in Darkwhisper Gorge.
