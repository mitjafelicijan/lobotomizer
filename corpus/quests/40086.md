Title: A Friend in Glenshire

It's far to the west of Tirisfal and into the Uplands. He needs some metal delivered, and you look like just the person.$B$BYou can find the entrance to the west of Solliden's Farmstead. Go through the gate and follow the road straight until you reach Glenshire. It may not be the safest road, but you can handle that.$B$BThere might be a fork in the road, I think you take a left... if I remember correctly. Marlow Neggle should be located in town somewhere there. Take this shipment to him.
Objective: Deliver Marlow's Ore Shipment to Marlow Neggle located in Glenshire.
