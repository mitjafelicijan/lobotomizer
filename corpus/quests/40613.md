Title: The Forbidden Arts
Description: There was a time when we would do anything for power. Shamans, dark arts, rituals and sacrifices. But when we rejected the protections of Theradras, we also rejected many weak magics!$B$B<She growls deeply.>$B$BWe are Magram! We are strong! We do not need tricks, we do not need mothering! We smash what we can smash and burn what we cannot. See the burning forests north! Puny elven lands are proof!$B$BWe cast out those who would not drop dark arts. But they threaten us with risen dead thanks to our foolish mercy at not killing our own. Find our outcast sisters nearby. Show them no mercy, for we never should have to them.
Objective: Slay 4 Outcast Necromancers for Jochi at Magram Village in Desolace.
