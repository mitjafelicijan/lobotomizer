Title: Lost Secrets of the Witherbark
Description: You again?! I'll forgive your bar tab if you do me a favor. What do you mean, you don't have an open tab?$B$BI suppose I might be mistaken, all of you $c types look the same to me.$B$BLook, the Witherbarks have developed a secret ritual that produces alchemical products with powerful properties, or so the tale goes. I've got to get ahold of it - these are vital secrets that could change the whole situation around here! Nobody around here seems to know any details, but perhaps the Elves down by their waterfall have an idea - ask for Lieren's sister, she's usually clever about these sorts of things. Oh, and don't mention this, but would you mind getting this taken care of before the holiday party?
Objective: Ask Loania at the Quel'Danil Lodge in the Hinterlands for further directions.
