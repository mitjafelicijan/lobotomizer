Title: Final Preparations
Description: We're nearly there, $c. All that is left is to retrieve a few more components so that I can attune the brazier and enable it to beckon forth Lord Valthalak.$B$BTo begin I must ask you to journey forth into Blackrock Spire and slay the orcs therein. They wear bracers that contain trace metals that I will need, so I'll need more than a few to extract the right amount out of them. Then, to complete the imbuing process, you'll need to bring me a Flask of Supreme Power.$B$BGood luck, $N!
Objective: Gather 40 Blackrock Bracers and acquire a Flask of Supreme Power. Return them to Bodley inside Blackrock Mountain.
