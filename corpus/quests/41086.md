Title: Wine for Kyleson
Description: I have prepared the Spectral Wine for you, and I have it here. I do hope that Councilman Kyleson is offering you something in exchange for all your work. Bring it to him, and do not waste time. After a few years, the Spectral Wine will lose its magical potency, and may just become normal wine.
Objective: Deliver the Spectral Wine to Councilman Kyleson in Karazhan.
