Title: Taming the Beast
Description: One thing I should mention is both the boar and the leopard are fierce offensive pets, but they leave a bit to be desired in defensive capabilities. Since our ranged weapons can pop ANY enemy with ease, what we need is something to keep them busy.$B$BHmm... I've got it! The Ice Claw Bear is sturdy and tenacious. When facing an angry bear, who would choose to go after a tiny gnome?$B$BIce Claw Bears can be found east of Kharanos. You have enough experience and skill under your belt now, so you should be able to handle one.$B$BOnce you're done, I'll give you access to the finalized Taming Rod so you can tame your own pet at will!
Objective: Use the Taming Rod to tame an Ice Claw Bear. Practice your skills, then return the Taming Rod to Clover Spinpistol in Kharanos.
