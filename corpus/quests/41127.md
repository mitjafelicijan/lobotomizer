Iâ€™m sure he would appreciate your help in resettling Stonetalon for the Alliance.$B$BThe outpost is called Bael Hardul, if my memory serves. To find it, you must go through the Talondeep Pass, then go south into the mountains. There is a secret path that leads to the outpost.$B$BPlease send my best regards to Whitepeak if you find him.
