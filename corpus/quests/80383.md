Title: Sharks Are Friends, Not Food
Description: Do you see that dorsal fin rising out of the water? That's a shark.$B$BIt appears to have come too close to the shoreline which is an anomaly for this species. I'm a marine biologist by trade and I've been watching that poor creature for a while now.$B$BThere could be a number of reasons that it's trapped here, but the goblins want to kill it like a stuck pig!$B$BThey think it's a threat to people in the water, but it's probably just scared and confused.$B$BI can't let that happen. I need you to go into the water and shoo the shark away.
Objective: Shoo the shark in the water away from the shore, then return to Toci Flipper.
