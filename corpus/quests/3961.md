Title: Linken's Adventure
Description: To think all this time that the reason Linken came here was to rid us of Blazerunner... He seems like such an ordinary guy, but I did notice that he's not at all interested in any of my experiments or gadgets like most gnomes would be. He must be a true warrior at heart.$B$BBring the totem to him. See if that helps him remember why he came here.
Objective: Take the Silver Totem of Aquementas to Linken in Marshal's Refuge.
