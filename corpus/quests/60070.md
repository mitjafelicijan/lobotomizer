Title: Matter of Trust
Description: Trust is something you can't buy, $R. Here's the deal, lad. You earn the trust of this gryphon over here and you'll get your ride to the camp. Fail and he'll have you as his breakfast.$B$BHah! Of course I'm pulling your leg here, lad. The winged beast won't even budge unless it trusts you completely. How, you ask? Food, of course. And a toy. Go figure. He likes to gnaw on them discarded bones the Lion's Pride Inn's cook throws out with the trash. He's gone and snapped all his, judging by the refuse at his talons.
Objective: Bring 5 Chunks of Boar Meat, 3 Dwarven Mild Cheese and 1 Chew Toy to Kelton's Riding Gryphon in the Goldshire.
