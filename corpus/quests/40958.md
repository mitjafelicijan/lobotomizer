Title: Into the Dream II
Description: The Nightmare could be everywhere. $B$BEven those who appear as noble heroes may harbor a hidden allegiance to this malevolent force. I cannot afford to trust blindly. Thus, I require tangible proof of your loyalty.$B$BIn the depths of these enchanted forests, dwell the wretched satyrs, vile creatures who have embraced the darkness. These fiends possess Nightmare Effigies, artifacts imbued with the corrupting power. While these effigies may lack the strength to unleash the full might of the Nightmare upon our world, they still pose a significant threat when wielded by the enemy.$B$BYet, their significance transcends their immediate danger. These nefarious effigies serve as conduits, linking the realms of the Dream and the mortal world. By bringing these fiendish artifacts to me, we can harness their unique properties to expose any agent of the Nightmare who dares to wield them. Three will be enough.
Objective: Bring three Nightmare Effigies to Ralathius in Nordanaar.
