Title: Shame Never Again
Description: I bear no love for the traitorous tauren, who allied with the demon-tainted defilers of our sacred lands. Despite this, duty beckons, and we must aid them still. The politics of the Horde and Alliance matter not in this moment. The honor of the Kaldorei shall not be tarnished again, and we shall not stand idly while innocent blood is shed.$B$BI shall dispatch a diplomat to the tauren to inform them of their precarious situation. Meanwhile, I beseech you to venture forth and thin the centaur numbers, granting the taurens of Freewind more time to prepare their defenses. Return to me with twenty of their bracers as proof of your deed. May Elune's light guide your path.
Objective: Bring 20 Galak Bracers to Commander Anashya Starfall in Thalanaar.
