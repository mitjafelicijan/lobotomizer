Title: On Guard in Stonetalon
Description: Hello, $N.$B$BYou seem to be full of wanderlust by the looks of you. Have you been to the Stonetalon Mountains? It is a land plagued by the Venture Co. and other enemies of the night elves.$B$BRecently, Sentinel Wolfrunner sent my friend Kaela Shadowspear there to investigate what's happening to the land, but I have yet to hear word back from her. I'm even more concerned because the Alliance sent a gnome mage along with her... a sign of trouble for sure.$B$BWould you find her and report back to me?
Objective: Find Kaela Shadowspear overlooking the valley entering Windshear Crag in the Stonetalon Mountains.
