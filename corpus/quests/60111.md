Title: A Decisive Blow
Description: You have proven yourself a capable defender of our roads and our people, $c. I believe you will be a great asset in putting an end to those responsible for these attacks once and for all. Our scouts have pinpointed the locations of two of the leaders of the Gnarlpine, Agal and Greenpaw.$B$BAgal, who orchestrates ambushes upon those traveling the road to Darnassus, resides in a cave just below the road. Greenpaw is a powerful shaman who has entrenched himself and his kin deep in the Ban'ethil Barrow Den, desecrating our sacred grounds and terrorizing those within and in the lands surrounding the den.$B$BExercise caution, for they are well protected by their tribesmen. I suggest you enlist the aid of a dependable ally if you intend to strike at these two. May Elune protect you and guide you on your path.
Objective: Moon Priestess Amara has asked you to kill Agal in the cave below the road to Darnassus and Greenpaw inside Ban'ethil Barrow Den.
