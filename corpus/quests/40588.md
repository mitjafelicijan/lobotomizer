Title: The Story of a Dryad
Description: Thank you so much, $N! I should properly explain why I came. A long time ago, my great grandfather taught the Tauren people the ways of Druidism. These teachings have since been lost but have recently been rediscovered.$B$BMy grandfather Remulos even helped the Tauren rejoin the Cenarion Circle. In spite of that though, many Tauren know very little about my people, and we in turn know little of them.$B$BI've come here to live in Mulgore so we can learn about each other. Kaylee is my friend and a druid student. I will help her recover then join you, please return to whoever sent you and inform them that we're coming!
Objective: Return to Gennia Runetotem at Bloodhoof Village in Mulgore.
