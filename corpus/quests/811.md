Title: Unity is Strength
Description: One of the other traits of the scorpids is their fierce loyalty. They will protect one another at personal risk - you've probably already seen this behavior during your first hunt. You'd do well to heed that lesson and adapt it to yourself: we are stronger as one; we are weak when divided.$B$BBring me 8 Large Scorpid Carapaces from Armored Scorpids and I'll grant you another reward.
Objective: Bring 8 Large Scorpid Carapaces to Kor'ghan in Sen'jin Village.
