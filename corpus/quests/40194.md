Title: Razzari Madness
Description: My people have a long and rich history upon this island, we once came from Stranglethorn, as part of the Gurubashi. But we looked for a new destiny when the wars stared, it was here that we called home. This island has been a place of refuge for our kind, and we have lived here in harmony with nature around us.$B$BAs of recently, my people have begun to betray their heritage, and their past. They use a foreign magic from our brothers the Hazzuri, one that is of an evil source, and tainted to the core. Instead of practicing the ways of the voodoo, they now are lost within the ways of shadow, mon.$B$BMy people are not what they used to be, and attack any who dare go close, their very essence be tainted. I ask of you to do me a favor friend, you need to go to Zul'Razar, it is located to the northwest on the isle. Kill the trolls there, gather me their Tainted Mojo, perhaps I may find a source of how to help them.
Objective: Gather 15 Tainted Mojo from trolls in Zul'Razar for Jubo in Maul'ogg Refuge.
