Title: At Last!
Description: I can't believe Pebblebitty doubted the authenticity of the horn. Between you and me, I think she's just jealous. I know she really wanted to kill that beast herself, what with the 'incident' and all.$B$BSo you need a proof of deed? After the contribution you just made to the museum, it won't be a problem.$B$B<Curator Thorius begins to fill out a large document.>$B$BThere we go! You can take that back to Pebblebitty.
Objective: Take the Proof of Deed back to Mountaineer Pebblebitty.
