Title: Skullsplitter Tusks
Description: It's expensive and hard to kill enough tigers to support the export of tiger fangs to the islands in the South Seas. Luckily, we've developed a technique that allows us to take mundane horn-like objects and turn them into undetectable forgeries.$b$bThe closest match we've found, amazingly, are the tusks of the Skullsplitter trolls.$b$bHey, before you say anything, what the buyer doesn't know doesn't hurt them, am I right? Bring me a large number of them so we can get to work on the monthly shipment!
Objective: Acquire 18 Skullsplitter Tusks and return them to Kebok.
