Title: Forest Troll Scum
Description: Fine, you've earned yourself the right to breathe the air in Karfang Hold.$B$BBut I have one last trial for you. A grudge, yes, that's what this is.$B$BAll the Blackhands were nothing but fools, the father was a misguided mongrel who was fooled by the wretched Gul'dan. Maim isn't even worth mentioning, he died a fool's death, nothing more deserving for his kind.$B$BAnd Rend? Rend is kneeling before that despicable dragon and doomed the entirety of the Blackrock Clan. But that's not even his worst call yet.$B$BHe made a forest frog his strategist.$B$BWar Master Voone?$B$B<Ok'gog yells that name angrily.>$B$BWar Master? He's nothing but a disgusting frog that must meet his end. Bring me his tusks and prove once and for all that the Horde led by a wretch who grew up amongst Humans has at least a quarter of the former glory of the True Horde.
Objective: Kill War Master Voone in Lower Blackrock Spire and bring his tusks back to Taskmaster Ok'gog at Karfang Hold in Burning Steppes.
