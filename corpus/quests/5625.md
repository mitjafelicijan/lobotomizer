Title: Garments of the Light
Description: It's usually about this time that one of your power is tested to see if they're worthy of wearing robes denoting their place in the church. But to be honest, I got more pressing matters to look into. Citizen of Kharanos' just came in here and told me 'bout a hurt mountaineer just outside town to the south--name's Dolf.$B$BYou heal Dolf and give him Fortitude, and I'll consider you done with proving yourself. How's that sound?
Objective: Find Mountaineer Dolf and heal his wounds using Lesser Heal (Rank 2). Afterwards, grant him Power Word: Fortitude and then return to Maxan Anvol in Kharanos.
