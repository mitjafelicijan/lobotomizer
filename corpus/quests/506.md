Description: A day or two ago, I was visited by the leader of this Syndicate. His name was Aliden Perenolde, and styled himself lord of this land. He confided in me his plans to take the orcs that stood against him as slaves, just as his father and his mentor, the despised Blackmoore, had planned.$b$bMore important was that he brought his mistress, a wisp of a girl named Elysa. Around her neck was the pendant the Warchief desires.$b$bNow go, I will make my own way, after I have settled my business here.
