Title: Solutions On Their Way
Description: This is a complete disaster! How could this happen in such a short span of time? Not only is this a monetary failure, but also a potential threat to our alliance with the Horde! I promised our benefactors in Orgrimmar new resources at a steady rate, but with what's happening on Blackstone Island, this will just be wishful thinking.$B$B$n, take the next trip back to Blackstone Island and assist Rustgate in salvaging this mess of an operation. Now go, I want to see results!
Objective: Return to Taxxlo Rustgate on Blackstone Island.
