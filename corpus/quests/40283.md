Title: Azsharan Front
Description: It may not look like it, $C, but we are in middle of a warzone. Highborne ghosts that linger in the forests clash with the Naga, for reasons I don't understand, and I don't want to.One thing I know, is that they are a danger for our outpost. They may be fighting each other for now, but it won't last forever. We should strike now, when they are weak.Go to Ruins of Eldranath. Kill the Naga, eliminate the Highborne. Show them, that Bloodfist Point is to be reckoned with.
Objective: Slay 6 Lingering Highborne, 10 Spitelash Serpent Guards, and 8 Spitelash Sirens for Dag'grak Bloodfist at Bloodfist Point in Azshara.
