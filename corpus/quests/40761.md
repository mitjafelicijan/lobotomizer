Description: Hey look, you did me a real solid, and I still owe you for everything you've done. You wouldn't be happen to be in the market for a gun would you? I don't just mean any gun, I mean a Dark Iron Desecrator. I have someone that owes me quite a lot of favors for help I offered to bring them to Steamwheedle for rare goods.$B$BIf this is something you're interested in, just know it will take some work to acquire. If this has your interest, then speak with Gelweg Darkbrow, let him know I sent you, and that I am asking for the plans.
Objective: Collect the Plans for the Dark Iron Desecrator from Gelweg Darkbrow at Steamwheedle Port, once they are acquired, return to Bixxle Screwfuse.
