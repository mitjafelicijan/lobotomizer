Title: A Demonic Missive
Description: The foul demons are mustering their strength, performing obscene rituals for some dark purpose I shudder to imagine. I am certain these Succubi are receiving some form of direction from their commanders, so it stands to reason that documented orders must be among them.$B$BIt is imperative that we acquire whatever plans we can find, and so I rely upon you, $N. Slay those vile temptresses until you find their orders, then return them to me promptly!
Objective: Gather the Demonic Missive and return to Melanastrasza in Hyjal.
