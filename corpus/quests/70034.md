Title: Hawk's Beak
Description: Norvok is in no condition to be out looking for a family heirloom, but I worry that perhaps he may attempt to venture out before he is fully healed.$B$BIf you could search for any trace of the spear that he had left behind, it would be greatly appreciate, no doubt by myself and Norvok.$B$BThe demon's to the east would be your best bet in searching, go swifty!
