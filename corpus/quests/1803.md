Title: Tome of the Cabal
Description: Ah! I see that you are a warlock of similar tastes to mine. Indeed, acquiring the Tome of the Cabal is a worthy aspiration. Did you know that it was once held within the walls of Lordaeron? It was vandalized though, almost half its pages removed. Who would commit such a heinous act?$b$bThat half is lost, though rumor says that it fell into the hands of the centaur of the Thousand Needles.$b$bThe rest of the text was to be transferred to Ironforge, but was lost in transit on the coast west of Southshore.
Objective: Retrieve the Moldy Tome and Tattered Manuscript for Jorah Annison in the Undercity.
