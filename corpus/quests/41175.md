Title: Mudpaw Mining Mishap
Description: We got a real catastrophe on our hands, and when Taxxlo finds out, he's going to have my head. A few nights ago, we were attacked at the Black Ash Mine to the north of here. The Mudpaw gnolls came and drove us out, killing many of my workers in the process. Now they're even mining themselves! Those cretins.$B$BWhat's worse is that I lost all of the supplies near the mine, and now those blasted gnolls are using them. Head to the Black Ash Mine, and recover eight crates of supplies for me, at least then I can save my own hide from this disaster.
Objective: Recover 8 Mining Supplies from the Mudpaw Miners at the Black Ash Mine for Mining Foreman Bizzlo at Rustgate Ridge on Blackstone Island.
