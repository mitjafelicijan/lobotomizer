If anyone wishes to visit with the Tide Mistress, then they first must speak to me. We Rethress come from the very depths of this world in places your kind have never seen, nor will ever see.$B$B... As much as I distrust you, interloper, we require aid from any that can offer it. Speak with Tide Mistress Rashal. You have my blessing in order to see her.
