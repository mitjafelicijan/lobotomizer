Title: The Key to Karazhan VIII
Description: <Dolvan carefully examines the key, studying it from every angle and reciting incantations to detect any potential issues.>$B$BIt appears that there is an interruption in the flow of arcane energy through the key. Upon further inspection, I have discovered that the crystals that hold the key together have been damaged beyond repair. Unfortunately, I do not possess the skills to fix them, and we will need to obtain new crystals to restore the key's functionality.$B$BI have heard rumors of a demon named Immol'thar who resides deep within the dungeons of Dire Maul. According to legend, his skin is adorned with peculiar gems that could potentially be used to repair the key. However, be warned that Immol'thar is a formidable foe, and the journey to reach him will not be easy.
Objective: Slay Immol'thar in Dire Maul, retrieve gems from his skin, and return to Vandol.
