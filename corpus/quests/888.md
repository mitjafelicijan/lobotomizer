Title: Stolen Booty
Description: While I'd like to recover all my goods, I'm sure that's not possible. Still, there's a few things that I absolutely must have!$b$bAs you see, my observatory is ready to go, but it needs the smaller of the two lenses. The first arrived by caravan from Durotar, but the second was bound by ship, and never arrived. Also, I never got my boot shipment from Drizzlik in Booty Bay!$b$bHead down to the pirate camp and see if you can find them.
Objective: Retrieve the Shipment of Boots and Telescopic Lens for Gazlowe in Ratchet.
