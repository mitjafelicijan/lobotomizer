Title: The Mark of Quality
Description: My philosophy on leatherworking is that the work must be the best quality possible - no compromises.Anyone who says that quality doesn't matter is trying to sell you ocean-front property in Dun Morogh!$B$BIn my latest pursuit of high-quality materials, I have run across thick yeti hides.The Yeti are native to Feralas, with many found in Feral Scar Vale.I want some, and I'll give you a choice of one of my leather goods for a stack of ten.If that sounds fair to you, then we're in business.
Objective: Bring 10 Thick Yeti Hides to Pratt McGrubben in Feathermoon Stronghold.
