Title: The Clutch of Atherelex
Description: Undoing a powerful satyr curse is not something that can be easily done, especially not with any magic that we here possess. We will need to create a satyr relic named the Clutch of Atherelex. Each satyr tribe holds a specific rod. Should a specific curse need to be undone all of the rods must be attached together in unison in order to channel a specific magic to remove the curse.$B$BTo create the Clutch of Atherelex we require the Rod of 'Ath, from the Vilemusk satyrs in Hyjal. The Rod of 'Ere from the Legashi satyrs in Azshara. Finally, the Rod of 'Lex from the Jadefire satyrs.
Objective: Gather the Rod of 'Ath, the Rod of 'Ere, and the Rod of 'Lex for Buthok Cloudhorn near the base of Hyjal.
