The armor, and weapons the undead use are quite deeply entwined with the very magic that keeps their minions standing.$B$BIf you desire my help, then I would also desire yours, I can uncover what this text reads, and point you and Wilhelm in the correct direction, but this would require a favor.$B$BTravel to Scholomance, and venture deep within. Inside I am looking for an old book that was archived there some time ago, titled 'Fire Beckoning and Command'.$B$BBring me this book, and I shall do as you have asked.
Objective: Venture into Scholomance and recover the book 'Fire Beckoning and Command' for Strahad Farsan in Ratchet.
