Title: Cutting Teeth
Description: The first order of business will be to put a little strength in your backbone. I could send you out to the Barrens to hunt kodo, but well, in all honesty, you're more useful to us alive than dead.$b$bI believe you would find a good match with the mottled boars you'll find to the north of here.
Objective: Kill 10 Mottled Boars then return to Gornek at the Den.
