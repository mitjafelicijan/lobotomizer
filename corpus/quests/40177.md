Title: The Gobcrank Flazwanger
Description: Damn, did we come down like a meteor, all the controls were going haywire, sparks flying everywhere, as the zeppelin hauled ass and smashed into the island! It was a miracle that I survived, though my luck ran out when I had to leave behind the wreck.$B$BAfter we plummeted down, we attracted the attention of a bunch of basilisks. The damn buggers made it impossible for me to go and find my Gobcrank Flazwanger! I made the thing back in Kezan a long time ago to help with stabilization, and let me tell you it's revolutionary!$B$BYou think you can manage a quick tilted turn on a zeppelin? Not unless you have a Gobcrank Flazwanger... Look pal, you're looking at me like I'm an alien, all you need to know is the thing is valuable, okay? And I'm willing to pay for you to go get it, now am I speaking your language?$B$BThe wreck was over by the Maul'ogg post to the south-west, it shouldn't be hard to miss!
Objective: Find and bring the Gobcrank Flazwanger back to Flaz Fusemix in Maul'ogg Refuge.
