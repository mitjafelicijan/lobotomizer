Title: Farstrider Lodge
Description: At last, $N, you are awake. It would seem that we survived the perilous journey south from the remnants of Lordaeron. We will have to make the best of our situation and work to make this our new home.$B$BThere is much to be done if we are to make this more than a temporary settlement for our people, $N. This lodge has only had to accommodate a handful of hunters and hasn't seen much traffic since the Second War, thus why its maintenance is questionable at best.$B$BVyrin Swiftwind resides in the lodge and has held station here much longer than any of us. If we are to make a home for ourselves here, then we should seek her counsel and ask where to focus our efforts.
Objective: Talk to Vyrin Swiftwind in the Farstrider Lodge.
