Title: From Stomach to Heart
Description: May the Earthmother guide the path you're traveling, young one. Welcome to Red Cloud Roost, where we keep the wyverns of Highperch, which have a unique bond with members of the Horde.$B$BWyverns are intelligent and generous creatures that have been invaluable allies to our ways for many years. Many would like to journey to the skies with them, and if that is your goal, I would be happy to teach you.$B$BTo begin, listen to what their stomachs crave and offer meat as a bribe to earn their trust. I recommend obtaining meat from adult plainstriders.$B$BSimply bring back two pieces of leg meat, but be mindful that if you hunt these majestic birds with excessive force, you may cause irreparable damage, making it impossible to harvest the meat.$B$BI look forward to seeing whether you will demonstrate the virtues of patience or creativity to complete this task.
Objective: Collect 2 pieces of Leg Meat from Adult Plainstriders for Trainer Tokala at Red Cloud Roost in Mulgore.
