Title: Garments of the Light
Description: Normally I put forth a small challenge to followers of the Light to test their skill. I want to see if they are worthy of wearing their first robes--a sign that the church outwardly approves of the $gpriest:priestess; and supports $ghim:her;.$B$BBut this situation is a bit different. One of Goldshire's citizens saw an injured guard near the lake to the east of here. His name is Roberts. Find him, heal him, fortify his body and return here. If you can do that for me, then I will consider your test complete.
Objective: Find Guard Roberts and heal his wounds using Lesser Heal (Rank 2). Afterwards, grant him Power Word: Fortitude and then return to Priestess Josetta in Goldshire.
