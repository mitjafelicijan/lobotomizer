He was a renowned engineer, of some kind.$B$BStrange couple, that's for sure, though they professed to only be seeking shelter.$B$BWith all our concerns across Duskwood, I was only able to spare a single Watcher to surveil their dealings, and what little Iâ€™ve heard has done nothing to quell my suspicions.$B$BIf you venture there and find out what you can as you go about your errand, you would render a fine service to the Night Watch.
Objective: Talk with F.W. in the shack south of Darkshire, then report back to Maltimor.
