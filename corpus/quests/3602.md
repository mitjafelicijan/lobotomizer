Title: Azsharite
Description: The ancient cliff giants of the southern region of Azshara consume the rock and buildings of the land for sustenance. The excrement from their consumption is a highly malleable and extremely strong crystal known as Azsharite.$B$BThe formations litter the southern arc, but few are ever recovered due to the extremely violent nature of the giants.$B$BYou are to venture south and recover enough of the Azsharite for the creation of the weapon's body. My felhounds will aid in the recovery of the crystal.
Objective: Recover twenty Crystallized Azsharite from southern Azshara. You may use the Felhound to assist you in 'sniffing' out the location of cleverly hidden deposits.$B$BReturn to Loramus when the task is complete.
