Description: More work, you say?Did my heroic mission of collecting bits of goo found inside elemental beings not slake your thirst for adventure?Perhaps more of the same will vainly try to fill the bottomless well of questing you possess...$B$BOK, melodrama aside, I do need more water elemental cores.I'm trying desperately to set up shop here, so the rewards won't be as great... but I promise you I'll tell everyone in earshot how you've helped me.Trust me on this - I know people in the Cartel!
Objective: Collect 6 Water Elemental Cores from the Sea Elementals and Sea Sprays along the Forgotten Coast of Feralas, and bring them back to Zorbin Fandazzle who is near the dock there.
