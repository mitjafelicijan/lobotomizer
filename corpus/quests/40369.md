Title: Further Studies
Description: Fascinating... I wonder if such changes may cause other creatures in the food chain to be affected. I think it is a matter worth studying further! But for that I would need samples of something larger... Ah, crabs! Yes. I believe we could find something new if we study those crustaceans.
Objective: Gather 10 Crustacean Carcasses from crabs in Darkshore, then return to Nessa Shadowsong in Rut'theran Village.
