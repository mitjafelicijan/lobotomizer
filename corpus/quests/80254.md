Title: Smashing Zul'Mashar
Description: Greetings, $N! I see that you have done quite a lot of work for Anu'delen, but now the time has come for something more serious than fetching artifacts.$B$BAlah'thalas is not far from the Scourge or the Amani, after the fall of Quel'thalas our people can no longer keep the rampaging Forest Trolls in check.$B$BOur scouts have reported that the Troll population of Zul'mashar in the Eastern Plaguelands is being converted to the Undead at a rapid pace.$B$BWe cannot have this, Forest Trolls are bad enough, we don't need to deal with an Undead version.$B$BGo there, exterminate both the living and the dead, we can't allow those beasts to go out of control.
Objective: Venture to Zul'mashar in the Eastern Plaguelands and kill Mossflayer Scouts, Mossflayer Shadowhunter, Infected Mossflayer, Mossflayer Canniva, five each.
