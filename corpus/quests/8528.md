Title: The Alliance Needs Spotted Yellowtail!
Description: It may not seem heroic to gather up cooked fish, but do not underestimate the value of preparation, young $c. Soldiers need to eat like anyone else, and we're here to do our part to make sure they have what they need once the war in Ahn'Qiraj commences.$B$BAccordingly, I am stockpiling spotted yellowtail, a versatile source of sustenance that stores well and can be used in many different dishes. It also doesn't have the odor of some other saltwater fish. Are you willing to aid me in this endeavor?
Objective: Bring 20 Spotted Yellowtail to Huntress Swiftriver at the Military Ward in Ironforge.
