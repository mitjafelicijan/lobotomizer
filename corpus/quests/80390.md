Description: A group of former Venture Co. Goblins have joined the Horde.$B$BSome of them chose to settle in Dustwallow Marsh in a town they now call Mudsprocket, while not yet forgiven for their past sins, the boss wants me to send whoever is willing to get some coin to deliver this letter to whoever is in charge.$B$BNo idea how the Undermine is gonna take this and frankly not my business to think of, anyway, you will find them in South Dustwallow Marsh, careful not to mistake the place for the Dragon's lair instead though.$B$BTake care, kid.
Objective: Deliver the letter to the leader of Mudsprocket.
