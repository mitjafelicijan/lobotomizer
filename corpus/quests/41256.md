Title: New Growth
Description: Some time ago, my sisters and I felt a disturbance from across the sea, and so some of us left our starlit home to investigate. Our search led us here, to what we call the Sleeping Tree. While it's not quite what the Quel'dorei had hoped for, it's still quite lovely, isn't it?$B$BTo help guard the tree we used its seeds to grow Ancient Protectors. Alas! As the tree's creation was flawed, so too was its offspring. The Ancients are steadfast, true companions that walk the ages with us...but it was not to be so with these Autumn Ancients. They only lived a mere few thousand years before withering and returning to the earth.$B$BHowever, recently I've noticed some new saplings have sprouted from the resting places of these Ancients. This gives me hope! Would you be good enough to search for these saplings and retrieve a few acorns for me? Perhaps then...$B$B<Marrondra trails off, losing herself in thought.>
Objective: Collect 3 Autumn Ancient Acorns from the saplings growing from the Ancients' bodies for Marrondra.
