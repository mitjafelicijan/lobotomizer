Title: Taming the Beast
Description: My grandfather used to tell me stories about what it means to be a Hunter. Somehow, for the various other races of our lands, it seems to be very different. For us, as Humans, it's to adapt to nature itself - to use it as a tool, one that we respect. Our ancestors tamed the wild horses, cattle, and even the fiercest prowlers, turning them into our trusted companions. These human hands can mold the land into many different shapes, and it is our ability to adapt that forges our survivability.$B$BI need you to visit Stonefield farm and tame one of the boars. A boar is strong and durable and can be both a fearsome adversary and a great companion.
Objective: Use the Taming Rod to tame a Stonetusk Boar. Practice your skills, then return the Taming Rod to Daisy Windhelm in Goldshire.
