Description: Just one last thing you must do, soldier.$B$BI've taken the liberty of putting Gor'tesh's head on a pike. Now all you have to do is take this head to the top of Dreadmaul Rock and stick it into the ground. Once you do that, watch as those cowardly ogres run for their lives! After you've had your fun, come back to me and I'll reward you for all of your hard work.$B$B<Oralius seems to be losing touch with reality.>
Objective: Take Gor'tesh's Lopped Off Head and place it at the top of Dreadmaul Rock. Look for a soft dirt mound to plant the pike.
