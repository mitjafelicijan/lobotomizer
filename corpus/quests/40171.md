Title: The Tower of Lapidis IX
Description: Now, I will do what I can to restore the attunement to this key. It shouldn't be that difficult, the magi who left the magic did a poor job with leaving magical traces upon it.$B$BStep back, I will do as you asked, it shouldn't take long. When I am done, you may return to the one who sent you.
Objective: Wait for Insom'ni to attune the Enchanted Brass Key, once the key is attuned, return it to Hydromancer Flakereef in Caelan's Rest.
