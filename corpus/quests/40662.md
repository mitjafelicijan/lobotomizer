Description: Who would suspect a Kul Tiran sailor to show so much affection? Those that many call crass, blunt, and overly loud at that.$B$BHe has surpised me, in a rather nice way; to be remembered after such a long time really is a compliment.$B$BHere, I prepared a letter for him, and -just- for him. Do not think to pry it open, my magic will know if you do.$B$B<She gives a wicked stare, and lets out a laugh to ease her feigned threat.>$B$BTake it to the sailor, and let him know his actions are appreciated.
