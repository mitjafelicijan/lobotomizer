My people did the bidding of a greater power, and followed it into the darkness willingly. We were nothing more then pawns until our demise.$B$BI did, however, see more than just misery, I saw the Seer of the Gor'dosh ogres, a once old friend of mine. Perhaps it is he that can offer some wisdom, or suggestion on how to continue, maybe it is he, who has the answers.$B$BSeer Bol'ukk resides within the Gor'dosh Heights amongst the rest of his tribe, you should find him on Lapidis Isle far to the north, the Gor'dosh Heights rest at its north western side.
