Title: Why Not Both?
Description: Although I love me boys, I wish I could whack 'em over their heads with me hammer when I see 'em like this. If they'd stop their bickerin', they'd be able te achieve so much more.$B$BI'm not the lass to sugarcoat 'em, maybe their father would've, but that disappointment of a man is long gone. We will make our own weapon te remind both of 'em, what real dwarven smithin' looks like. They were on the right track, but they sadly lack vision. We will combine both of their ideas.$B$BYour adventurer friends tell the wildest stories about the most mind-bogglin' creatures. In the white ravines of Maraudon in Desolace lives the giant Landslide, made of pure marbled stone. Rumors say deep within the Hateforge Quarry of the Burning Steppes, the acid pools are so potent, a bein' manifested itself from them!$B$BTe smith a truly powerful weapon, bring me pieces of both of their bodies.
Objective: Obtain the Heart of Landslide from the depths of Maraudon, and the Essence of Corrosis from Hateforge Quarry for Frig Thunderforge at Aerie Peak
