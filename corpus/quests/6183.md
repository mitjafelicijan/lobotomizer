Title: Honor the Dead
Description: Five of my best field agents were assigned the Marris case. One returned, only to end up dead in his sleep three days later.$B$BWhat little information we did manage to get out of him was incoherent gibberish. We made out two words: "Nathanos," and "Blightcaller."$B$BI do not have the available manpower to continue this investigation and Ravenholdt will not assist us. We must get to the bottom of this; if only to provide closure to the families of the deceased. Will you help?
Objective: Speak with Mathias Shaw again if you wish to accept his task.
