Title: Leather, a Draenic Luxury
Description: It is good to work with leather again. On our old planet of Outland, we had scarce access to this resource. It was considered a rarity, a luxury there with the lack of beasts and lack of water. Our planet was once as dense and populated as this world until the demons came, and the waters dried. It is like we live in a paradise on Azeroth. I had my doubts about Sanv K'la and his plan at first, but it seems like this land is much more promising than I had imagined.$B$BI would ask you, outsider, to gather leather for me from the Young Sawtooth Crocolisks. It is thick but still stretchable in its quality and has made good use for our purposes. With the lost ones of Fallow Sanctuary lurking about, it has been more dangerous to get.
Objective: Gather 10 Sawtooth Leather for Masat T'andr.
