Title: The Grimtotem Plot
Description: Not all tauren tribes were so eager to align themselves with the Horde. Among them, the Grimtotems stand as outliers. While most tribes strive to subdue and tame their primal instincts, the Grimtotems embrace their savage nature. One would assume they would find kinship with those responsible for the murder of Cenarius, but they too have their own sense of pride.$B$BThe Grimtotems walk a precarious path, treading the line between loyalty and independence. Recently, our scouts have reported skirmishes between their forces and the tauren of Camp Mojache to the northwest. It piques my curiosity as to the cause of this disagreement.$B$BVenture forth to the Grimtotem Compound and uncover any clues that shed light on the situation. I am intrigued to understand the motives behind this conflict.
Objective: Discover any clues that could shed a light on the situation of Grimtotem Tauren and return to Commander Anashya Starfall at Thalanaar in Feralas.
