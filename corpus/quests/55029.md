Title: In Need of Information
Description: Oh the Captain sent you? Well isn't that a relief, it's been almost a week that we've been sitting around here with no word.$B$BI was about to start figuring out a way to get out of Booty Bay, but it seems like the only thing keeping us safe are the Bruisers.$B$BThe Bloodsail Buccaneers have been wanting us dead ever since we sunk one of their ships in a battle. Lets just say they got lucky and ambushed us near Grom'gol!$B$BThey want us all gone and won't stop until we are, it seems.$B$BThe Bloodsails are a disorganized bunch, and not centrally commanded. Each encampment or ship has their own crew and their own leader, and this group hunting us is only doing so because we killed the man's brother.$B$BIf anyone knows anything, it's Revilgaz.
Objective: Speak to Baron Revilgaz.
