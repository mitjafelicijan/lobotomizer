Title: Gnome Engineering
Description: Engineering at the expert level breaks into two disciplines: gnome and goblin. While I think it is a waste, you should be aware of gnome specialization. They make items and gadgets that claim to change the world, but rarely often work.$B$B$N, read this manual. If you wish to learn how to make metal paper weights, then take that manual to Tinkmaster Overspark in the Gnomeregan Reclamation Facility. Remember - membership is permanent and prevents joining the other discipline, so make sure you are sure before finishing his task!
Objective: If you wish to learn more about Gnome Engineering, take the Manual of Engineering Disciplines to Tinkmaster Overspark at the Gnomeregan Reclamation Facility in Dun Morogh.
