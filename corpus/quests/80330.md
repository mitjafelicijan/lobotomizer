Title: The Hunter's Path
Description: Hello, young hunter. You look to me like you are skilled enough to handle a beast and train it as your companion.$B$BWe hunters tend to have a pet by our side, though I hear your kind have some... unorthodox methods. Nonetheless, you should speak to Viz Fizbeast at Razor Hill if you wish to learn how to tame a pet of your own.
Objective: Speak with Viz Fizbeast at Razor Hill.
