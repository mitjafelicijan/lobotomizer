Title: Ashenvale Corruption
Description: There is a corruption lingering within the forest of Ashenvale, while I cannot pinpoint exactly where it is, or what is causing it. The signs of the furbolg being reduced to a state of madness only boldens my thought, and hearing reports of what lurks within the forest to the east only haunts my mind.$B$BIf there is anything that can be done, it would be that of Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus. He has led our people to a new beginning, and perhaps it will be him that can solve the corruption present here in Ashenvale.$B$BI have prepared this letter for him, please, deliver it with urgency, for the stake of all beauty in Ashenvale could be at stake.
Objective: Deliver Faldan's Message to Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus.
