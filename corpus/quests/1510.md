Title: News of Dogran
Description: He was stationed at Camp Taurajo, where we've been trying to weed out the quilboar. He led a few grunts to one of their camps, where he was hurt bad. The others made it back and tried to rescue him. He was in bad shape, his wounds festered, so they were afraid to move him without patching him up first.$b$bThey sent a message here, requesting a healing draught from the trolls at the Malaka'jin at the base of the Stonetalon Mountains. We sent someone to get it, but they haven't returned yet.
Objective: Speak with Ken'zigla at the Malaka'jin.
