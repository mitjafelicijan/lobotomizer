Title: In Search of Menara Voidrender
Description: Let us be clear about one thing, $N: I don't feel you are ready for such responsibilities. I don't think aiding in the creation of any item of power is something a novice should ever be involved in; especially one so untested.$B$BBut that's not my decision. The powers that be, or at least the ones that do wish to impart such gifts upon you get to decide that.$B$BIf you're interested in learning more, I suggest you seek out Menara Voidrender in Ratchet. She usually resides in the tower above the port town.
Objective: Speak with Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.
