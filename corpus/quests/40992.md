Title: Foulhide Mongrels
Description: The Foulhide gnolls, wretched creatures that they are, have likely crossed your path on your journey here. Like any typical gnoll, they possess little intelligence, resorting to savagery and brute force. Communication or cooperation with them is an exercise in futility.$B$B The Regents turn a blind eye, while the so-called Rebellion remains preoccupied with their own affairs. Thus, it falls upon us to address this predicament.$B$BOur motivations are far from altruistic, mind you. These gnolls have become an insurmountable obstacle, intercepting crucial supplies dispatched from Undercity. Such interference is unacceptable. Venture southward and dispatch as many of these abominations as you can.$B$BReturn to me with sixteen Foulhide paws as undeniable proof of your success.
Objective: Bring 16 Foulhide Paws to Harlan Ballow in Stillward Church.
