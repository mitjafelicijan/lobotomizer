Title: Report to Nordanaar
Description: I am bound to hold the demons at bay, and such duties compel me to remain here. The lack of word from Nordanaar is worrying, but I suspect the growing demonic presence may be what is causing delays.$B$BI must ask you to deliver my report to Nordanaar at the very top of the summit. Follow the road until you reach the town. Find Arch Druid Dreamwind, and give him this letter.
Objective: Bring the Report from Endaras to Arch Druid Dreamwind at Nordanaar in Hyjal.
