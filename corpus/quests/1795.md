Title: The Binding
Description: If you're are sufficiently prepared, then we should begin. Let me explain the process to you.$b$bI will begin by creating the basic summoning circle. When that is finished, my acolytes will use the rods of channeling to create the greater circle.$b$bOnce that is done, read the incantation from the Tome of the Cabal, and the felhunter will be pulled forth. Be careful, $n. A felhunter is a powerful foe, and I'd like to see you keep your head on your shoulders.
Objective: Using the Tome of the Cabal, summon and subdue a felhunter, then return the Tome of the Cabal to Strahad Farsan in Ratchet.
