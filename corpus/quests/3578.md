Description: Ah, I've been expecting my Rah'pawene, Samantha Swifthoof and she's yet to come! I'm confused...$B$BCan you help me and find her? Last time we spoke she was so much excited to see the new places and travel at her leisure from a port to some distant forests and northern regions of the Eastern Kingdoms, alas, the only port I know nearby is the Ratchet.$B$BI'm most certain Samantha braved to the ferry and swam to the Booty Bay.$B$BWhere could she travel to from there I do not know. Perhaps you could find her for me? Just to be sure she's fine...
Objective: Find Samantha Swifthoof.
