Title: The Key to Karazhan IV
Description: Yes, yes, Archmage Vandol was truly one of the greatest minds of the Kirin Tor. He was a dear friend of Medivh, if you can believe such a thing. Although, some might argue that Medivh had no true friends.$B$BAlas, I fear I cannot be of much assistance to you. After the devastation of Dalaran at the hands of Archimonde, Vandol suffered injuries that took a great toll on him. He spent many moons in recovery and eventually retired as one of the most accomplished mages of our time.$B$BI seem to recall him expressing a desire to settle in or around Theramore. If he still lives, I suggest asking for him in the city itself. One of our apprentices, Magus Halister, might know of his whereabouts.
Objective: Ask Magus Hallister in Theramore for the whereabouts of Vandol.
