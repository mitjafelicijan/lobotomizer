Anyway - I need this crate delivered to him, it contains some of the spoils you plundered, as a thanks for the info, as well as what he requested.$B$BSo pal, its that simple, go and talk to him, give him this here crate. You'll find him in Ratchet, up the road from the town a bit, him and some friend share a place there with metalworking or something. Catch the boat from the dock here in Booty Bay.
