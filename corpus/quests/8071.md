Title: Paragons of Power: The Confessor's Mantle
Description: The confessors of the Zandalar all wear a distinctive mantle, marking them as the preservers of the tribe.  These mantles are woven with powerful mojo that aids them in judging those who would threaten our tribe.  As a priest, you too must spend your time judging those worthy and not; such a mantle would definitely be a blessing to you.$B$BIn exchange for fighting Hakkar's minions in Zul'Gurub and bringing me the Paragons of Power I seek, I will give you a mantle worthy of our finest confessors.
Objective: Bring Al'tabim the All-Seeing a Primal Hakkari Aegis.  You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Revered with the Zandalar Tribe.$B$BAl'tabim the All-Seeing is located on Yojamba Isle, Stranglethorn Vale.
