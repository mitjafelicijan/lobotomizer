Title: Devils in Westfall
Description: Ah, I think I have it. A messaging spell... I believe that's the effect he's looking for.$B$BI'll have to create a scroll with the spell impressed upon it. To do that I'll need debris from a dust devil.$B$BWhile I gather the rest of the components, why don't you head to Westfall and find one of the foul creatures? They are dangerous, but I'm sure it's nothing you can't handle if you're willing to subject yourself to one of Gaxim's experiments.$B$BI'll be here when you return.
Objective: Bring Dust Devil Debris to Collin Mauren in Stormwind.
