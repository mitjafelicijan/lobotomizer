Title: Crocolisk Hunting
Description: Many a hunter is attracted to Loch Modan to hunt our famous crocs. There are always merchants who seek out crocolisk skins for clothing items or armor, and there are also some who enjoy the taste of their meat.$b$bWe do some trade in this, but not a huge amount, as the crocolisks are ferocious and have entrenched themselves on the islands in the Loch. But don't let me dissuade you, it's quite an experience, wrestling with the jaws of the beasts.$b$bWhy, this one time...
Objective: Get 5 pieces of Crocolisk Meat and 6 Crocolisk Skins for Marek Ironheart at the Farstrider Lodge.
