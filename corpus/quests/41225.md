Title: Kaelin's Gift
Description: I never thought he'd become so sentimental! Back in Silvermoon, he was the toughest guy on the streets. But it's a pleasant surprise. I'm genuinely happy he found her.$B$B<Vanudal deftly works with the fox skin, cutting and sewing it with masterful precision.>$B$BHere you go. It's as good as I could make it with the materials on hand. Perhaps with some golden threads, it could be even more exquisite, but I assume you're not ready for a journey to the Ruins of Silvermoon, are you? Please convey to Kaelin that he owes me a bottle of Dalaran Red!
Objective: Present the stole to Kaelin Bladesong.
