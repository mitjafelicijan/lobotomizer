Title: Taming the Beast
Description: Time for your final exam, champ. You better be ready, 'cause otherwise you ain't coming back breathing. Our Orc friends call these babies Armored Scorpids.$B$BThey're quick on their tiny legs, and their carapace is light yet durable. Kinda goes with the whole "armored" thing. They got a deadly sting to boot, so if you get your hands on one, ain't no one gonna push you around no more, ever.$B$BWhen you get back, I'm gonna show you something real nice. Let me tell you, pal, these skills are beyond mad! You'll be able to tame whatever beast you want, and call 'em and dismiss 'em at your leisure.
Objective: Use the Taming Rod to tame an Armored Scorpid. Practice your skills, then return the Taming Rod to Viz Fizbeast in Razor Hill.
