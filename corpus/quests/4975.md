Title: The Completed Orb of Noh'Orahil
Description: I will get started immediately on crafting your orb and infusing your new demon into it. When done, you will have the choice of having it in the form of a staff or orb. I always felt it was important to cater to a warlock's chosen weapon... I see no reason not to continue that practice.
Objective: Wait for Menara Voidrender to complete the Orb of Noh'Orahil and then speak to her again.
