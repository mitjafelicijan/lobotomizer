Title: Alpha Strike
Description: The plan is for various leaders of the gnolls - Alphas as they call themselves - to be taken down within rapid succession.If we're able to execute this sort of swift and precise devastation against them, it would cause chaos in their ranks.Perhaps it would also drive a message through their thick flea-bitten heads that we can and will destroy them!$B$BI want you to be the messenger of my will; eliminate five of their Alphas within one hour for this to work $N, or we'll remain at this impasse!
Objective: Kill 5 Woodpaw Alphas and return to Hadoken Swiftstrider within one hour.
