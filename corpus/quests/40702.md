Title: Exploring in Peace
Description: My name is Whitepeak, I lead this group of would-be explorers here to Bael Hardul after hearing stories that it still stood. To my surprise it was, workable. There was a lot of clean up, but now that the work is done, it will be a good base of operations.$B$BThere is, however a hitch.$B$BThe last thing I expected was to have the Venture Co. at our doorstep, that was one detail we did not hear, and now that we are set up they keep moving more, and more people into Windshear Crag. If we ever want to have a chance to explore, do so without constant protection we will need to remove this threat.$B$BDown the hill is Windshear Crag, it is there that the Venture Co. operate, head down, and remove their threat, on my behalf.
Objective: Slay 8 Venture Co. Operators, 14 Venture Co. Loggers, 8 Venture Co. Deforesters at Bael Hardul in Stonetalon Mountains.
