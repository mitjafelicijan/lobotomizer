Title: The Rethress Tide Scepter
Description: The Rethress Tide Scepter holds power for me within the great depths of the world, and especially within Nazjatar. It is the birthright of the Rethress, and it gives us dominion over many others. I had suspected they would try to steal it when the Spitelash was formed to get this dominion.$B$BYou may wonder why I am telling you this. It would never concern a land-creature like yourself. Well, I buried the Scepter in a secretive location so that they could never claim power legitimately. Now that the Rethress Sanctum is founded, and we are not in immediate danger, I would like it returned to me.$B$BThere is a place called the Tower of Eldara, held by some Highborne Keeper. It is located at the very far northeastern tip of the peninsula. To the west of it, along the coast, are four rocks. Buried around those rocks is the Rethress Tide Scepter. Get it and bring it to me, interloper, to help me reclaim my birthright.
Objective: Find the buried Rethress Tide Scepter and bring it to Tide Mistress Rashal.
