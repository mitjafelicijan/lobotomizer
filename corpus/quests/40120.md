Title: Aggressive Wildlife
Description: The encroaching wildlife has become a problem for both myself and my wife. In the past, we lived at peace with the animals of the forest, though it now seems we must always be wary of our moves and watch the forests for the eyes of stalking predators.$B$BThe Ghostpaw have been especially troublesome and have for days now stalked our house for signs of weakness. I have given them none, but I fear that something may be driving the wildlife to act in a much more aggressive manner.$B$BRegardless, gather me five of their pelts. Thin the numbers so that they are not so brazen in their attacks. You can find Ghostpaw Wolves all around the forest.
Objective: Gather 5 Ghostpaw Pelts from the local Ghostpaw Wolf population and bring them to Ardaen Evermoon in Ashenvale.
