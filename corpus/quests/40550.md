Title: The Goblin Linguist
Description: Let's think... If anyone is able to translate this, it would be some goblin. These fellows do trade with everyone, there must be someone who has at least a basic understanding of this language. Could you please take this to Ratchet? I will stay here for now and observe the camp.
Objective: Find someone who is able to translate the tablet. Ratchet is a good place to start.
