Title: Destroying Venture Co. Leadership
Description: From what we could gather, this resistance is too organized to just be a simple rouse of dissatisfaction among workers. Someone must've instigated this. Thorough as we are, we already have a suspicion on who's behind it.$B$BGelwex Goldfingers and Dex Lodespark. Ungrateful bunch. Both of them were known to be troublemakers, nothing the bruisers couldn't handle, yet it seems they had more nefarious plans than slacking on the job. Whatever they're planning, you will stop them right in their tracks. Set an example and show everyone on this island that the only acceptable punishment for their actions is execution.$B$BThey're most likely among their conspirators in the slums. Do not come back until you've dealt with this.
Objective: Dispose of the resistance's leadership and bring their heads to Taxxlo Rustgate.
