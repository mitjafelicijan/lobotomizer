Title: A Host of Evil
Description: The Forsaken do not pass on their... illness... from what I have seen. This diplomat seems to be granting undeath to would-be followers. I am beginning to think he is one of the Scourge.$B$BFor now, my concern is not with him though, it's with the growing ranks around him. They creep from the shadows daily, almost begging him for more power.$B$BI'm not powerful enough to fight them on my own, $N. What do you say? Are you up for some hunting?
Objective: Kill 8 Razorfen Battleguard, 8 Razorfen Thornweavers, and 8 Death's Head Cultists and return to Myriam Moonsinger near the entrance to Razorfen Downs.
