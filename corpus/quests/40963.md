Title: Head of Solnius
Description: You hold in your hands the severed head of Solnius, once a noble and revered dragon, now corrupted by the insidious Nightmare. The sight is both awe-inspiring and unsettling, as the twisted patterns and symbols on his scales exude an eerie darkness. It is a testament to the power and malevolence of the Nightmare that even a mighty dragon could be so thoroughly corrupted.$B$BWith Solnius vanquished, the news of his demise will bring both relief and satisfaction to Ralathius in Nordanaar. The green dragonkin will rejoice in knowing that a formidable threat has been eliminated, and the Emerald Dream can rest a little easier.
Objective: Bring the Head of Solnius to Ralathius at Nordanaar in Hyjal.
