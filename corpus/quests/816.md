Description: $N, please, can you help me? My son Kron went hunting days ago, and he still hasn't returned. He went west towards the Barrens to hunt crocolisks along Southfury River. I fear the worst.$B$BAs strong as he was, his stubborn pride has always drawn him into trouble. I warned him that the crocolisks were powerful and vicious. He grew angry and stormed off.$B$BIf you can't find him, at least bring me a sign of his fate... even if you have to open up the stomach of every crocolisk along the Southfury's banks.
Objective: Bring a sign of Kron's fate to Misha Tor'kren at the farmstead northwest of Razor Hill.
