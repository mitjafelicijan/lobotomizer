Title: The Upper Binding II
Description: I have attempted to use the Dragonkin Charge to repower the relic, but I have had no luck in energizing its latent power. I suspect we will require a more active source of ley energy.$B$BI will require some items before I can begin this ritual. First, I need you to collect the following items which should be easier to obtain. Five essence of fire, and a single fragment of earth should be enough to get us started. These materials might be tricky to find, but I do know that fragments of earth can be found from earth elementals seen in Silithus. I suggest that you start there.
Objective: Gather 5 Essence of Fire, and 1 Fragment of Earth for Parnabus in Gilneas.
