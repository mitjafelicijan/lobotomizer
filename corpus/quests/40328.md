Title: Naga Tridents
Description: A few weeks back Naga began to enter the territory just south of the Bloodsail Compound. We don't know why they are here, or why they came but they seem quite drawn to the heights. The slithering wretches have done nothing but wander about and bother our ships as they sail about. I'd like you to do battle with them for all of our slain kin.$B$BGather from the Naga Explorers their tridents and bring me them as proof of your deeds. 14 Should do just nicely, maybe we can use them as harpoons against the beasts.
Objective: Gather 14 Naga Tridents for Raga Darkeye at the Bloodsail Compound in Stranglethorn Vale.
