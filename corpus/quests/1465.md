Title: Vahlarriel's Search
Description: As you continue your search of the wagon you find not only a pendant, but also footprints leading off towards the south. In the distance you can see smoke rising from a large fort. The smoke is from a kept fire, not the burning of buildings, and your instincts tell you that the Malems, if still alive, were taken that direction.$B$BYou think Vahlarriel at Nijel's Point should not only see the pendant you've found, but also know about the signs of life to the south.
Objective: Return the Malem Pendant to Vahlarriel Demonslayer in Desolace.
