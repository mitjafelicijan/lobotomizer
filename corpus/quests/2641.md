Title: Sprinkle's Secret Ingredient
Description: When I was a kid, my sister used to do all the cooking. It was horrible! I could barely stomach some of her concoctions -- until I found what I like to call my "secret" ingredient! Add it to anything, and... WOW! It tastes great!$B$BWhat is it, you ask? It's a mushroom called the Violet Tragan. If you want me to help you turn this horrid-tasting brew into something edible, head to the Hinterlands, and look for a small lake there.$B$BOh, and remember, the Violet Tragan can only be found underwater.
Objective: Sprinkle in Gadgetzan wants you to collect a Violet Tragan and return it to her.
