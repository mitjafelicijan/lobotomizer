Title: The Big Energy Project
Description: I have one final project that I am calling The Big Energy Project, it has to do with the gathering of the Blue Dragonflight that has cropped up a while ago around the Lake Mennar to the south-east.$B$BIt's not often that dragons get involved with much, but from what I've learned, these blue dragons love their magic!$B$BIf I can get my hand on some dragonkin's staff, just think of the possibilities!$B$BThe orcs in Valormok have been talking a little about their presence and a new Lieutenant posted there. It's a good thing my long ears were able to hear the little details! Go find this Lieutenant and take his staff, he has to have one! Now, gather up a group of friends, or fellow adventurers, this is gonna be a big operation, not just something you can do alone.
Objective: Go to Lake Mennar to the south-east and retrieve the Staff of Azsalus from the Lieutenant there.
