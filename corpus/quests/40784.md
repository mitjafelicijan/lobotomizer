Description: You really found them then? All of them were real, not just the Orc? And of course you brought no proof back with youâ€¦ Look I can't just take your word for it you know? We may have to- Now now! Don't get angry! If you insist so vehemently than I believe you, it's just that... Nevermind!$B$BLook, how about this? I've got a spare Reindeer Voucher I won in a game of dice a few years back. I'm sure you'll enjoy riding your new friend so chill out! Please take this voucher to Quark here in the Vale and he'll dispense with the product for you. I did note your findings in the log! I was drunk but I can still write, rest assured it'll go to the organization I work for.
