Title: Morrow in Felwood
Description: Confronting Wildwalker with the notes would be pointless, as they do not provide any concrete evidence of Morrowgrain actually being used in Felwood. It's all mere speculation at this point.$B$BIf the druids have indeed brought Morrowgrain seeds to Felwood, they would have surely hidden them well. However, I believe that the local birds might hold the key to this mystery.$B$BThe owls in these lands have had to become resourceful in order to survive. If the druids brought Morrowgrain seeds to Felwood, the owls may have stolen some of them for food. $B$BIt's not a pleasant thought, but it may be our only hope. We need to search the intestines of local birds for any signs of Morrowgrain seeds. According to the notes, the seeds have a distinct, reddish color. If you find any, bring them to me immediately. It won't be easy, but it's a risk we have to take if we want to uncover the truth behind this mysterious plant and Archdruid Staghelm's obsession with it.
Objective: Find a Morrowgrain Seed in the intestines of Felwood owls.
