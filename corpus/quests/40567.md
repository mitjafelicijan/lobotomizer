Title: Sleepwalking at Day
Description: Oh, I can't do this.$B$B<She sighs loudly and massages her eyes.>$B$BMy fianc√© is dog-tired all the time, disappears randomly during the night, and recently I found long black hair on his clothes.$B$BI just can't figure out how he could do this to me! But I must be certain. Please, $C, can you go look into this for me? Before I do anything rash. I can't even bear to speak to him, never mind go back to our old bedroom. Just find out his damned side of things, and tell me what lies he speaks. Any extra evidence you can find would be good too, I suppose.$B$B<She screws her face up tightly.> He's probably avoiding me and pretending to be useful, chopping wood by the lumber mill. Bert Mano is his name.
Objective: Speak to Bert Mano in Hawk's Vigil, and see where your investigation leads.
