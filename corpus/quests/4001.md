Title: What Is Going On?
Description: So far, my communication with the dwarf, Kharan, in the cell across the hall, has been limited. I have, however, managed to convince him that I, rather -we- mean him no harm.$B$BGo speak with him and gather as much information about the Princess and her captors as possible. Take that information back to the Warchief.$B$BThrall does not want the Princess harmed, but instead, has some grand plan laid out, which includes her being safely returned to Ironforge. Kharan already knows all of this... Go!
Objective: Speak with Kharan Mighthammer and gather information about Princess Moira Bronzebeard's kidnapping. Take that information to Thrall in Orgrimmar.$B$BYou recall Gor'shak mentioning that Kharan is being held in a cell nearby.
