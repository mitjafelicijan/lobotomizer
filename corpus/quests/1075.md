Title: A Scroll from Mauren
Description: Okay, now for the remote detonation part of my plan... oh, I haven't explained that yet, have I?$B$BOkay, so the short of it is this: with a little magic, I can make it so the explosives go off while you're not around. I'm putting together a device that'll allow you to push just one button and have the NG-5 explode when you're ready.$B$BBut I need a spell from a friend in Stormwind--Collin Mauren is his name. You can find him in the mage quarter there. He's human, so he shouldn't be hard to miss.
Objective: Find Collin Mauren in Stormwind.
