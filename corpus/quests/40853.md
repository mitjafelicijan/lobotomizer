Title: The Staff of Shinban
Description: Truthfully, $N, I don't really care how many dumb ogres are killed by gold-a-dozen mercenaries. Whether it's you or some other that brings me a bag of heads, it makes no difference.$B$BOh, don't look at me like that, you know I'm right. Anyway, if you want something meaningful to do, listen: our scouts overheard that two ogres are vying for power amongst the Brol'ok. One of which calls himself Shinban Four-Eyes. A two headed ogre with three actual eyes, claims the fourth is a hidden one that gives him the vision required to lead!$B$BI would be worried about that, $N. Either he is telling the truth and is a caster powerful enough to have magical sight, or he is smart enough to understand metaphors. Both are worrying. Regardless, he is your primary target.
Objective: Slay Shinban Four-Eyes, and bring his staff to Sergeant Arbington at Ravenshire in Gilneas.
