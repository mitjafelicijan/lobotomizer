Title: Meeting an Elder Centaur
Description: Perhaps there is more to you than meets the eye, $r. You have shown yourself willing to be an enemy of the Magram, but that does not make you a friend of the Gelkis.$B$BBut, you may be in time. That is not for me to decide. In the tents nearby, seek out the oldest among us. He has even more stories to his name than I do. His name is Yesu'gei.
Objective: Find and speak with Yesu'gei.
