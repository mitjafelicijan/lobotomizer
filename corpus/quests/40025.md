Title: Inner Binding Purification
Description: With Ganz'ih's remark, it would appear these bracers have become corrupted. Someone is taking advantage of our weakened status and turning my kind to nefarious means. We must cleanse these bracers of their taint, and to do so, I require natural materials.$B$BYou can find them in this world, and they should do well in purifying the taint. Bring Speaker Ganz'ih five Life Roots, ten Solid Stones, and three Wild Steelblooms. He will be preparing the materials for me.
Objective: Gather 5 Life Roots, 10 Solid Stones, and 3 Wild Steelblooms, and bring them to Speaker Ganz'ih.
