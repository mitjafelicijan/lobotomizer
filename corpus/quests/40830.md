Title: Scouring Greyshire
Description: It may seem dreary here in Gilneas, though I must assure you this was not always our reality. In times past, I spent many years studying under my masters' tutelage, and painting great manuscripts for the Light. I spread the faith and broke bread with many fine folk.$B$BThere are a foolish few who would assume we went unscathed during the perilous times of the Third War. Whilst we may not have suffered directly from the plague as our northern cousins have, we did have conflict with the Scourge.$B$BYou see, two years ago, a powerful lich named Naze the Eternal breached the wall near Oldrock Pass. Ultimately, the undead were defeated by the good soldiers of Gilneas, but our victory was paid at a terrible toll.$B$BI was lucky to escape Greyshire with my life, others were not so fortunate. I ask of you to scour that forsaken place, and recover the manuscripts that I spent my younger years painting. While you are there, bring peace to some of the forlorn souls that still remain.
Objective: Recover the Greyshire Manuscripts from the Ruins of Greyshire for Father Oblen at Shademore Tavern in Gilneas.
