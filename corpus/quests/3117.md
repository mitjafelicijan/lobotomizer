Title: Etched Sigil
Description: This sigil was given to me by a messenger from our hunter trainer, Ayanna. It seems Ayanna would have words with you when you have a moment. Read it and bring it to her afterwards.
Objective: Read the Etched Sigil and speak to Ayanna Everstride at the top of Aldrassil in Shadowglen.
