Title: The Mystery of Karazhan II
Description: With the Pendant of Ardan secured we can begin to look towards other leads, as of recent many more ghosts have begun to sprout up around the tower of Karazhan. It isn't every day that the dead begin to walk again within the ethereal form after all.$B$BI ask of you to venture around the ruins of Karazhan and slay the ethereal dead, and from them, collect 8 Ghostly Substance. It is from this substance that I will be able to check to see the magical potency, or what kind of magic has driven these souls to stir from death.$B$BWatch your footing, for the Dark Reaver of Karazhan has been known to watch over the gatehouse of the tower.
Objective: Slay the ghosts around Karazhan and collect 8 Ghostly Substance for Magus Ariden Dusktower within Deadwind Pass.
