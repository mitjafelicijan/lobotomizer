Title: Reclaiming the Tinkerspark Transponder
Description: Now that we know Gnomeregan is destroyed, and there is no way to get a new Tinkerspark Transponder, we must reclaim our old one. The naga stole it months ago, and we must have it to make progress here.$B$BThere's no way back to Gnomeregan, so we must make do with what is here in Azshara, and I know those blasted Naga still have it! The one who led the raid was called Laszan, a fearsome foe. If you want to stand a chance, I advise you to bring some friends. It might be your only way of killing him for good!$B$BHe should be east of the Ruins of Eldarath along the shoreline.
Objective: Reclaim the Tinkerspark Transponder for Gigno Flaxwhisker.
