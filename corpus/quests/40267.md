Title: The Maul'ogg Crisis IV
Description: So much thinking, and so many dead ends, I do not think that I possess the abilities, or magics strong enough to bring Lord Cruk'zoggs mind to a state of ease.. Or in such a way that the rest of the tribe wouldn't notice.$B$BI do, however know of a powerful being that potentially could be of assistance to me. There is a troll of mystique located on Kazon Island to the north, nestled between Gillijim and Lapidis. He is one of considerable power of which I met long ago, and spoke of in fever dreams of the night.$B$BHis powers were once strong enough to do battle with a great sea beast and destroy it with ease. If there is any that could make such a spell, it would be him.
Objective: Find Insom'ni on Kazon Island.
