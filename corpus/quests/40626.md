Title: Contempt for Necromancy
Description: Our mother, Theradras, provides and protects even in this harsh land, $N. Perhaps you do not fully understand it. But know one thing: she cannot abide those who desecrate the dead.$B$BThe Gelkis would never stoop to such dark magic as to manipulate the dead for strength and personal benefit. The thought alone is enough to make my hooves itch.$B$B<He shakes himself and a few grey hairs fall to the ground.>$B$BHmm, I do not know which of the tribes have been practicing necromancy, but recently there have been sightings of centaur doing just that to the East. Do not bother trying to converse... simply remove their wretched lives from their bodies. And make it slow, if you can, a merciful death is too good for those who deny souls their proper rest.
Objective: Slay 4 Outcast Necromancers and return to Yesu'gei at Gelkis Village in Desolace.
