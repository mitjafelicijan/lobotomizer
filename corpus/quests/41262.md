Title: Diplomacy's End
Description: Our intelligence indicates the presence of a new arrival at Felstrider Retreatâ€”an undead elf, a mindless minion obedient to Sylvanas Windrunner and her Forsaken. We cannot afford any collaboration between the Blood Elves and the Horde. It is imperative that this threat be swiftly and discreetly neutralized. Given your capabilities, I believe you are well-suited for this mission. What is your response?
Objective: Slay Ithirilen Shadewind.
