Title: The Depths of Karazhan I
Description: I have been sent by a council of mages from Orgrimmar to look into the growing power that emits from Karazhan. I have done much research into the tower itself and the artifacts that once belonged in the ruins around it.$B$BI have some hunches, the first of which is that the energy that me, and the other mages have felt is coming from beneath Karazhan. In an old, and decrepid series of catacombs underneath the tower. If I am correct, then we will need an old Pendant which holds power enough to re-energize a key created by Medivh.$B$BThis artifact is known as the Pendant of Ardan, thought lost for some years now. My only hint is that of the ogres of Deadwind Pass, of which, their leader Var'zhog has begun to exhibit magical prowess.$B$BFind Var'zhog, and from him, reclaim the Pendant of Ardan.
Objective: Search for the Pendant of Ardan, rumored to be held by the ogre Var'zhog, collect it, and return to Kor'gan in Stonard.
