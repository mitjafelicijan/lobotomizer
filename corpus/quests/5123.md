Title: The Final Piece
Description: The log you found on the high chief looks extensive, but after looking through a couple of the pages, you find that you cannot read the text. The markings are so crude and poorly-formed that you are not sure if anyone would be able to read them.$B$BBut perhaps Donova will be able to tell you what it says... 
Objective: Bring the Crudely-written Log to Donova Snowden in Winterspring.
