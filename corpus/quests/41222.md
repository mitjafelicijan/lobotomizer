Title: Sunsworn Response
Description: Reiterate to her every word you've heard from me.$B$BMy resources are mine to wield as I see fit, and in this moment, they serve to influence those whose opinions truly matter. The throne shall be mine, and under my rule, our people will flourish.$B$BCertainly, I could distribute these resources to the poor. But to what end? The very next day, they would find themselves in need once again. We must establish a solid infrastructure to sustain themâ€”farms, vineyards, proper hunting grounds. Simply providing daily sustenance accomplishes nothing. Rest assured, with the crown in my possession, ensuring the welfare of the Quel'dorei will be my foremost priority. However, if some must perish before that vision is realized... well, that's regrettable.$B$BNow, be on your way, and ensure Liadrin hears every bit of it.
Objective: Repeat the words of Astalor Sunsworn to Liadrin in Ballador's Chapel.
