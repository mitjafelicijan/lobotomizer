Title: Clearing Out Vermin
Description: Excuse me, $R, can I have your attention for a moment?$B$BI am Kathy Wake. I am a part of a branch of the Alliance military responsible for ensuring the safety and prosperity of Alliance lands. We've recently been sent here with a large contingent of men. Although I personally believe we are needed more back home, it is not my place to question orders.$B$BOur mission has been to ensure your people arrived safely to the lodge, and also to get you settled in. However, it is not easy to keep everyone safe from the dangers out here. While my men have been dealing with the larger problematic elements in the region, smaller ones have been left unattended for too long, and now they have been allowed to run rampant.$B$BThe refugee caravans could be in danger if something is not done quickly. I take it you can fight? If so, please go out there and take care of the troggs that have been infesting the area around the lodge!
Objective: Kill 8 Trogg Vermin.
