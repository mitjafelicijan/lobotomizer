Title: The Curse of the Tides
Description: So you're looking for an altar of some sort? Well, I'm no expert on troll ruins like my father, but I have heard about a sunken troll city out near that island you're looking for. Maybe you should try there.$b$bYou got my knife back for me, so I guess you can borrow it... but I want it back when you're done!
Objective: Destroy the Altar of the Tides with Catelyn's Blade, kill Gazban and bring the Stone of the Tides and Catelyn's Blade back to Baron Revilgaz.
