Avoid the Horde as best you can and protect the child with your life.$B$BSouth of the orcs' eyesore of an encampment you will find those beautiful glades where our sisters keep vigil, waiting in the trees to ambush the invaders. Sharptalon is reported to aid the defense of Ashenvale near there.$B$BBring the little one to him and relay the Moonfeather family name. I pray his response will be favorable.
