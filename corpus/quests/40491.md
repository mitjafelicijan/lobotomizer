Title: Scrap Forager
Description: Greetings stranger, it seems some new recruits from this new Horde are arriving at last.$B$BI'll keep this short, we're not doing so well here. It's like everything is being held together by worg spit, and the lack of resources certainly doesn't help. I'll say it's about time we fixed that.$B$BDark Iron tends to be quite scarce in the surface of the steppes, though it is carried by many. Whether it be baubles, equipment, or sitting in a creature stomach.$B$BVenture out and collect me a sizeable amount of scraps so I can keep forging equipment for our grunts to keep Karfang Hold safe.
Objective: Scavenge 50 Dark Iron Scraps from various creatures in Burning Steppes and return to Blacksmith Torren in Karfang Hold.
