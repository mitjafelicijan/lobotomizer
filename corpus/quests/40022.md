Possessed with dark fury, the warband leader now lays claim to the ruins of our city while preparing to descend the mountain on his return to Witherbark Village.$B$BYou must stop their plunder and break their morale! Bring the head of Kin'toza to me and it will serve as a symbol for my people to rally behind. With their leadership in shambles, we would truly stand a chance at reclaiming Zul'Rasaz.
