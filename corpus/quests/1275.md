Title: Researching the Corruption
Description: Foolish blood elves toil with demonic magic. Have they not witnessed what happened with the naga and with the satyrs of Kalimdor?$b$bI fear that the blood elves will meet a similar deformation. Azeroth cannot afford to give birth to another vile race of monsters.$b$bI wish to study the brain stems of the satyr and naga so that I might deduce what fate the elves are headed toward. In Blackfathom Deeps, on the coast of Ashenvale, you will find both satyr and naga.$b$b'Tis a long journey, $n.
Objective: Gershala Nightwhisper in Auberdine wants 8 Corrupt Brain stems.
