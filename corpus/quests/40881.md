Title: The Evil Made Me Do It
Description: I may have... miscalculated a bit. It seems without the knowledge held in the 'Powers of Blood', I cannot stabilize the mix. I need that book.$B$BI scoured every corner of this land with no success. It can only mean one thing: The book is hidden in the city of Gilneas itself. It looms like an impenetrable fortress, and the thought of trying to find a single book within its walls is overwhelming.$B$BThe city is heavily fortified, and the human forces stationed there are not to be trifled with. They are determined to hold onto what little they have left, and they will stop at nothing to keep their city safe. It will take all of your cunning and stealth to even attempt getting past their defenses.$B$BIf, however, you do manage to locate the book... I will reward you beyond measure.
Objective: Find 'On the Powers of Blood' in Gilneas City, then return to Orvan Darkeye at the Ruins of Greyshire in Gilneas.
