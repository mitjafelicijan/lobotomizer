Description: Hendel? Yes, I know the man. But why would you need one of my soldiers?$B$BElling sent you to find him? Hmm, I don't like the sound of that. Elling wouldn't have you come to me first if your business wasn't troubling. I understand if you can't tell me what this is about, but know this: I have a duty to protect these lands. If you're going to cause a disturbance, then I suggest you inform me of whatever you can.$B$BI believe Hendel was stationed at the first tower outside of Theramore. Be cautious.
Objective: Search Sentry Point for any sign of Private Hendel.
