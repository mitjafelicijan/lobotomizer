Title: Risen Oilblazes
Description: Well, I guess we figured out why the elves are up here: The whole dang forest up ahead is on fire! And it's gotta be goblin-made, too.$B$BNo one else uses the kind of oil that burns that long! That's Undermine stuff, kid. There ain't no way a gnome could get their hands on it. I don't know what's goin' on in this site, but I don't like it.$B$BGo out there and bring back some of that oil. Maybe you'll find some clues about what happened before we got here. If not, at least we'll have topped off our own oil supplies!
Objective: Collect 8 Living Petroleums from Risen Oilblazes in the Scorched Stand, then return to Nert Blastentom.
