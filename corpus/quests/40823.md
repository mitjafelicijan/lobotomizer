Title: The Key to Karazhan IV
Description: Vandol.$B$BHe was senior to me, and I begrudgingly admit that I learned much from him about the arcane and its rules. They say he was friends with Medivh, but I think it was a relationship of mutual benefit more than anything else.$B$BThe last I heard, Vandol had barely survived the fall of Dalaran and had retired to some backwater swamp in Dustwallow. Our ogre "allies" has set up a settlement in those lands, so if you want any chance of finding him, you'll have to deal with them.$B$B<He leans in closer, his voice dropping to a low, dangerous whisper.>$B$BBut if you manage to find Vandol, tell him that his old colleague sends his regards. And if you fail, well...let's just say that I have a way of dealing with people who waste my time.
Objective: Ask someone in Brackenwall Village about the whereabouts of Vandol.
