Title: Apprentice's Duties
Description: I sent my apprentice out into the marshes to skin some of our famous giant Wetlands crocolisks. When he didn't return, I went out to look for him... Let's just say it wasn't a pretty sight.$b$bMidwife says he might pull through, but in the meantime I still need my skins!$b$b...If you'd like to kill a few more of the brutes, I wouldn't be opposed, after what they did. You'll find the crocs north up the coast, beyond the murloc hovels.
Objective: Collect 6 Giant Crocolisk Skins and bring them to James Halloran in Menethil Harbor.
