Title: The Tower of Lapidis VI
Description: I hadn't imagined Lapidis could harness such power, even into such a small object such as this key. Perhaps there is someone else that could be of assistance. The fleet had a Magus with us when we first began to establish Caelan's Rest. Shortly after he departed in search of a latent , powerful magic that emanated from the island.$B$BWhen he returned he spoke of a great hermit that was beyond his own power, and that of others he seen in his lifetime. He ventured out once more to learn from this figure, and to study out in the island. If there is something that can be done, perhaps Magus Valgon can help us get the answer. You should be able to find him somewhere on this island, I would imagine he has a camp somewhere.
Objective: Find Magus Valgon on Lapidis isle, and inquire about the Enchanted Brass Key.
