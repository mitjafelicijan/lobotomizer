Title: Supplies to Auberdine
Description: Delgren has asked me to deliver messages and supplies to Sentinel Starbreeze in Auberdine, but I am loathe to leave on my own. Dangerous foes operate in the forest, and I do not wish to risk letting these supplies and information fall into the wrong hands.$b$bIf you and others could act as my guards, I could leave now. With your protection, I have no doubt that we can see these goods safely to Auberdine.
Objective: Speak with Delgren the Purifier at Maestra's Post after seeing Feero safely through Ashenvale Forest.
