Title: Agon Ore
Description: Out in the Badlands by Agmond's End is a special type of ore that has been pressured by the elementals there for some time. It's unique and rather hard to find.$B$BIt can be used for a lot of things, but I'd like to hope it can be tested for use in a drill perhaps.$B$BIn Agmond's End, a small camp of dwarves were over-run some time ago by troggs.$B$BI don't think the dwarves were even close enough to getting all of the ore and some trogg must have some of it. Head there and kill them until you find a piece of it, then bring it back.
Objective: Find Agon Ore from the Troggs in Agmond's End.
