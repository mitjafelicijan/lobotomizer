Title: Arugal's Folly
Description: Greetings, $C!$B$BWe've been on the tail of Archmage Arugal for some time, since the end of the Third War actually. What did he do? When the Scourge came to Dalaran, we were devastated.$B$BSeeing our friends and family being turned undead really messed with his mind. He thought the solution was a summoning ritual, to summon something that could aid us and stop the Scourge's advance. Even though as his mentor I advised against his idea, my warnings fell on deaf ears.$B$BThe resulting monstrosities are the Worgen. Even though they killed the Scourge, they quickly turned on us, worsening the situation. After going mad with his failure, he adopted the worgen as his children and retreated to Shadowfang Keep.$B$BAfter what had transpired I moved to Stormwind to try to forget what happened. Although it pains my heart to say this, you must travel to Shadowfang Keep in southern Silverpine Forest and end his life.
Objective: High Sorcerer Andromath has tasked you with the death of Archmage Arugal. Return to him when you're done.
