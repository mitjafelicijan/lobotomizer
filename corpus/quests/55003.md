Title: A New Power Source
Description: As a technician, it's our job to keep everythin' runnin' ya see? Well, we've run into a small problem, and by a small problem, I mean a big problem!$B$BThe Oil from the platform isn't coming in and we're barely making due with what we got! That and we're gonna run outta barrels of the juice soon.$B$BBut, I got an idea anyway. There's a place not far from here to the west called Thunder Ridge, and it's got that name for a reason.$B$BThe beasts there pack one HELL of a punch! Get me six of their energized scales, so I can tinker with them as a power source. Now, they're not gonna be givin' you their scales, so use some force!
Objective: Gather six Energized Scales from Lightning Hides and Thunder Lizards at Thunder Ridge to the west and bring them to Technician Spuzzle in Sparkwater Port.
