Title: More Components of Importance
Description: $C, listen closely. Now that we have the location of the last amulet piece, we still need another component to suffuse the brazier with; something that will provide a focus strong enough to entice the spirit of my deceased, former comrade.$B$BAn ogre necromancer that traveled with us, Kormok, delighted in summoning forth the souls of the banished dead of Purgation Isle, off the south coast of the Hillsbrad Foothills. Go there and retrieve some Soul Ashes of the Banished from their remains.
Objective: Obtain Soul Ashes of the Banished and return them to Bodley inside Blackrock Mountain.
