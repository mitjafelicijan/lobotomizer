Title: A Gnome's Assistance
Description: Thinking... Thinking... I know I came here for something important...$B$BI have an idea, $N. In the cave over there is a gnome named J.D. that was very kind to me when I first arrived here. Perhaps in my disoriented state, I might have mentioned something to her.$B$BWhy don't you go ask her if she knows anything? Oh, but be careful -- she's always messing with those crazy glowing crystals I've seen in the crater. I'm not quite sure what she's up to in there!
Objective: Find J.D. Collie in the cave at Marshal's Refuge.
