Title: A Bloody Solution
Description: Well met my friend. You've come to join us? You have caught the spark of curiosity, and must surely satiate it. I will admit, those in Ravenshire look upon us as a cult. How foolish they are to see our strength as sin, eh?$B$BI have been tasked to study blood itself, and I am curious to see if the blood of other races shares similar properties to our own. To the east lay the Hinterlands, a place once called home by the Witherbark Trolls. From them, gather 5 vials of Witherbark Blood and return them to me.
Objective: Gather 5 vials of Witherbark Blood from the Witerbark Trolls in The Hinterlands for Ethan Ravencroft in Hollow Web Cemetery.
