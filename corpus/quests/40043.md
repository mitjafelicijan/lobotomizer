Title: The Missing Robot
Description: Before you return to Flaxwhisker Post, I would ask you to deliver a letter for me. It is about a robot that the Flaxwhisker post has been operating in the region for some time. I helped with its creation in detecting magic within Azshara, and I spotted it on a trip to the Rethress Sanctum a few weeks back. It was hopelessly mired in some state of disrepair, broken and mindless.$B$BGigno would want to know at the least what happened to it. Deliver this letter to him, $N, and thank you again for the supplies.
Objective: Deliver the Letter for Gigno to Gigno Flaxwhisker.
