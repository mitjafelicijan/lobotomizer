Title: Harpy Raiders
Description: The blasted harpies have been ravaging our caravan supplies for too long. It's time we slit a few of their throats and diminished their numbers.$B$BI've been snooping around their nests and figured out who leads who. The most devastating attack will destroy a good section of their lower chain of command and then we can work our way to the top.$B$BI'll start you off slow, take out Witchwing Harpies and Witchwing Roguefeathers in the Northwest and bring me 8 Witchwing talons. That should be a good start...
Objective: Collect 8 Witchwing talons.$B$BReturn them to Darsok Swiftdagger at the Crossroads.
