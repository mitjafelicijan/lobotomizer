Title: Cartel Gold Donations
Description: Listen, Kid. I don't care who you are, or however many fantastic, magical journeys you've been on. Go tell all those lads and lasses in the tavern if you're lookin' for praise. I care about the oil that lubricates the system around here. You get what I'm sayin'?$B$BThe Cartel, we need gold to organise and run our daily activities. And there are always things that need doin', it's like a fact of life, you know? So... you fund us, and we take notice. Maybe even let you break a kneecap every now and then, and we can look the other way. Maybe.
Objective: Bring 10 Gold to Clemence the Counter in Booty Bay.
