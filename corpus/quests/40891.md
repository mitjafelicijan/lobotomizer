Title: The Corruption of the Barkskin Tribe
Description: The Barkskin Tribe was ruled by two elders. Myself, and Elder Barkmaw, a rather seasoned and old warrior who rose to prominence from his aggressive nature and impactful speeches.$B$BI do not blame the corruption of the Barkskin Tribe on any of its warriors, gardeners, or ursa. I blame it solely on Elder Growlheart. During his reign, he grew more and more hostile, leading to a culling of many I would have called dearest friends.$B$BElder Growlheart must be killed if there is even a minor chance the Barkskin tribe can be recovered. You will notice him by his discolored fur, he acquired this look from his addiction to a tainted sap him and his most loyal consume.$B$BYou can find Barkskin village to the southwest, near the bottom of the Hyjal itself.
Objective: Find and slay Elder Growlheart deep within Barkskin Village for Elder Barkmaw at Nordassil Glade in Hyjal.
