Title: Mastering the Arcane
Description: <Ureda glances at you with dismay.>$B$BYour skills still require some honing, and your posture betrays your arrogance. Typical of any new apprentice who bears overconfidence before his own wits. Not that it matters to me. It's your own problem.$B$BAny aspiring mage should have his spells ready at all times and think two steps ahead. That's why your lack of awareness should be compensated with at least something you could procure by yourself.$B$BThere is a… “mage” who resides on the bank of Southfury River, not far from Thunder Ridge. The task you will receive from this mage might be arduous at first glance, yet it most likely will bear fruit if you put your brain into it.
Objective: Speak to Chok'Garok on a bank of Southfury River in the Barrens.
