Title: Vigilant Last Defender
Description: Before we part ways, there is one thing still gnawing at my consciousness. With my body mine once more, memories of my last moments rush back to me. Darkness had hidden among us and showed itself once the protectors of the Light left.$B$BWhile most of Uther Lightbringer's men followed him to fight against the Scourge elsewhere, one valiant paladin remained to defend the innocent. As we were forced to retreat into the mine, he stood his ground as long as he could, but alas, his unwavering devotion to the light was not enough against the hordes of undead thrown at him.$B$BI cannot remember his name, yet I feel indebted to his sacrifice, even if it may have been fruitless in the end. Should you find traces of him inside the mine, take them out of this accursed place. That is all I wish for.
Objective: Search The Widow's Nest on the Forlorn Summit for anything related to Miriam's defender. Perhaps you can find clues on his identity.
