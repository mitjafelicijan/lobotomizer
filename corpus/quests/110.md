Description: I'm going to spend some time taking a look at Scrimshank's surveying gear... as well as putting his personal effects in order.I get the sneaking feeling behind my ears that this isn't the last loss we'll be facing against these bugs.$B$BI'd like for you to check in with Alchemist Pestlezugg to see if he has had a chance to process the insect parts we sent him.If they're ready, bring them to me.
Objective: Check in Gadgetzan for Alchemist Pestlezugg and his analysis of the insect parts.
