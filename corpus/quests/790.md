Title: Sarkoth
Description: $C! I thought I would die out here with none to know of it. While I was hunting the scorpids of the Valley, I came across a particularly vicious-looking one. Hurling myself at it, I managed to inflict a massive blow to its claw before it closed around my leg.$b$bI wasn't ready for its stinger though, and it sliced down and into my chest, cutting into my flesh and letting my blood.$b$bPlease, you must kill the scorpid for me! My honor must be upheld! I fought it up on the plateau to the south.
Objective: Kill Sarkoth and bring his claw back to Hana'zua.
