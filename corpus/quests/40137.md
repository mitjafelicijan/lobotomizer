Title: Strike Them Down
Description: Just the person that I need. Listen. A few months ago, a pack of wolves inhabited the cave just north of here. At first, we thought it was just a small number of them, so we didn't pay those beasts much attention, being busy with war and all. But they have become aggressive of late, and they even got bold enough to attack residents of Glenshire.$B$BSo, how about this, you go and cull their numbers. In the meantime, I will try to gather some coins from the residents for you, deal?
Objective: Kill 10 Graypaw Wolves for Butcher Reeves.
