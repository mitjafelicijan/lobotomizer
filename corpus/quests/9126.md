Title: Bonescythe Digs
Description: Don Julio's Bonescythe armor pattern requires bone fragments - a lot of bone fragments. While those crazy enough to venture into Naxxramas provide me with enough of the core materials to make the armor, I'm always looking for more Scourge bone fragments.$B$BSo what do you think? Interested in getting your hands dirty and destroying some Scourge at the same time? It's a win-win situation.
Objective: Rohan the Assassin at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands wants 30 Bone Fragments.
