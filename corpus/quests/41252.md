Title: Kingsbane
Description: Ah, an adventurer...$B$B<Astalor's face contorts with disdain.>$B$BThere is a delicate matter at hand, and I require assistance in a manner that leaves no trace leading back to me. I've recently discovered that one of the distant cousins to the traitorous Prince Kael'thas still lives and commands the forces of Felstrider Retreat.$B$BAs you can undoubtedly surmise, having a Sunstrider alive poses a considerable issue, as many may perceive his claim to the throne as legitimate. I require him eliminated. Assemble a formidable party, dispatch him, and dispose of his body in a lake.$B$BOnce the grim task is accomplished, present his signet as proof to Melathe Shadesong. Ensure that no one discovers it was I who... suggested this undertaking.
Objective: Slay Eldin Sunstrider and bring his signet to Melanthe Shadesong. She can usually be found by the auction house.
