Title: Ritual Secrets of the Witherbark
Description: The Witherbark are descended from our oldest enemies, the Amani Empire, but have since lost even the veneer of civilization. I don't even want hazard what sort of dark practices happen when they cook their ritual secrets in those boiling cauldrons of theirs, but supposedly those concoctions are careful and deliberate. A quaff of their brew serves as anesthetic for their cruel and barbaric rituals; the victim is rendered indistinguishable from a blind drunk for hours, and remembers little afterwards. If you want a copy of this dark formula, you'll have to snatch them from the Witherbark Callers of Shadra'Alor.$B$BDo be careful, will you? You don't seem the type to drink poison deliberately.
Objective: Bring a Witherbark Tablet back to Truk Wildbeard at Aerie Peak in the Hinterlands.
