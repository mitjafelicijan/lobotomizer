Title: A Glittering Opportunity
Description: Hey, $R! In addition to the usual weapons in my stock, I have an opportunity for you.$B$BWhile I was doing my run from Ratchet to the Crossroads I saw a weird light on the mountain just south of Ratchet. There seems to be a ramp up just outside Ratchet, some raptors call the thing home though, so be careful.$B$BNow I don't know what it is, but you adventurin' types like to dive right in when it comes to dangerous situations right? It could be some HUGE deal like a demon cult or whatever for all I know and them doing nasty stuff to Ratchet would be very bad for MY business. Consider whatever spoils you find as payment.
Objective: Investigate the mountain south of Ratchet.
