Title: Unhallowed Branches
Description: I have seen the devastation that the corruption of nature can bring. Felwood is a stark reminder of this truth. However, this glade here remains pure, and it is all thanks to Ethwyr.$B$B<The druid pauses, his head bowed in reverence for a moment, before continuing>$B$BHis sacrifice, however, touched only those closest to him. We must honor his legacy by continuing to cleanse Felwood of corruption.$B$BWithin the southwestern reaches of this very forest lies the ancient glade, a place steeped in both beauty and darkness. It is there that you shall face the heart-wrenching sight of crazed treants.$B$BFrom the fallen bodies of these treants, claim six branches tainted by their suffering. Though tainted they may be, these branches possess a latent power. Bring them to me and we shall breathe new life into their corrupted essence.
Objective: Bring 6 Unhallowed Branches to Taloras at Talonbranch Glade in Felwood.
