Title: Unseen Enemy
Description: This totem will help me enter a deeper state of trance and allow me to commune with the spirits of old. With their help, we might be able to locate your missing plates.$B$B<Logrash begins his ritual, and his eyes turn pale.>$B$BBah, I forgot how taxing this ritual is. The plates you seek are immensely powerful, $N. Show this message to the Truthseeker, and he will understand where to send you next. But be warned, it appears that we are not the only ones looking for the plates. Someone—or something—dark is on the trail as well.
Objective: Logrash wants you to travel to Thunder Bluff and bring the Inscribed Boar Pelt to Sage Truth Seeker.
