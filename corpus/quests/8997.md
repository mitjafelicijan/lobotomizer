Title: Back to the Beginning
Description: I suppose that this is goodbye then, my friend. But, I'll always be here if you want to come back and talk with me from time to time. Probably while you're loitering around waiting for your buddies to join you for a raid on Blackrock Spire.$B$BGo, before I start to cry. Go back to Deliana in Ironforge and tell her what's happened.
Objective: Speak with Deliana at The High Seat in Ironforge.
