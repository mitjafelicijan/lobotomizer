Title: Scouring the Desert
Description: For some time now, we have been tapping the crystal resources of the Silithus desert. The only dangers we faced were from the creatures that made this place their home and the oppressive sand and dust and heat.$b$bBut now the Alliance seems to have caught on to what we have found here. It is now a race between us to capture the natural resources, and keep them from the other.$b$bI need every set of hands that is available. I hope I have yours.
Objective: Find and deliver Silithyst to the Silithyst Extractor then speak with General Kirika at the Horde encampment near Hive'Regal.
