Title: Return to Lewis
Description: The gryphon master in Westfall is Thor.If you've spoken to him before, then you can take one of my gryphons to him.$B$BThat's a good lesson to know: gryphons are always trained to fly to their capital city, but they'll only take you to a remote gryphon master after you've already been there.$B$BYou've already been to Thor, so just speak with me again when you're ready to take a gryphon to Westfall.Once there, you can deliver Osric's Crate to Quartermaster Lewis.
Objective: Buy a gryphon ride to Sentinel Hill from the gryphon master Dungar Longdrink, then take Osric's Crate to Lewis at Sentinel Hill.
