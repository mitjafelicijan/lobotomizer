Title: Areyntall Family Value
Description: The Areyntall family has been a noble house within Stormwind for quite some time, and Lordaeron before that. We made our fortunes from naval trade and procured rare materials from far away lands to sell within the Kingdom.$B$BI cannot take full credit. Of course, it was my father's doing, but I hoped to live up to the same legacy as he. I did well for a while nonetheless and ran my family's ship, the Crownguard, for a few months. It is a tragedy that it sank along with part of my family's goods.$B$BYou can find the wreck off the eastern coast, sunken deep into the ground. If you could go there and search the wreckage for my family's strongbox, I would make it worth your while.
Objective: Collect the Areyntall Strongbox for Sir Areyntall.
