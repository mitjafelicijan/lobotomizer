Title: Return to Nessa
Description: I must send a response to Nessa.She'll be very interested to know how different the fish here are from those along Teldrassil's coastline.We can only guess the cause, but it is my suspicion that the world tree itself is affecting the wildlife around it!$B$BPlease, take this response to Nessa.If you wish to take a hippogryph back to Rut'theran then speak with the hippogryph master Caylais Moonfeather.If you wish to take the ferry, then one regularly departs from the dock to the northwest.
Objective: Bring Laird's Response to Nessa Shadowsong.
