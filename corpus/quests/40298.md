Title: Red Skies of Durotar
Description: The wyvern are native to Kalimdor and can be found throughout much of our land. They have proven to be loyal companions to our wind riders. I remember the days when we first ensured the help of these beautiful creatures.$B$BIn truth, they have been a gift from the Earthmother, strengthening the bond between the orcs and my people; it's not an exaggeration to say that without them we wouldn't be where we are today.$B$BBristlefur, here, is already tame. She won't attack you, rest assured.$B$BThe truth is the poor girl seems to be a bit bored ever since I forgot to bring her favorite toy with us to Durotar. If you have the time, young $c, please find her a new toy and something to snack on. In return, I'm sure she would be happy to take you to the skies for a short while.
Objective: Bring 5 Chunks of Boar Meat, 3 Mutton Chops and 1 Bone Chew Toy to Bristlefur in Razor Hill.
