Title: Scythe of the Goddess
Description: In the whispers of ancient legends, tales unfurl about the upper reaches of Medivh's Tower—a sacred haven where the profound wisdom of the Guardians was once safeguarded. Alas, the passage to this sanctum has succumbed to the passage of time, and the tower now stands in disrepair. The library nestled within the upper parts has been sealed away from mortal reach.$B$BYet, in the tides of destiny, hope gleams amidst the darkness. If you can find a means to breach the barriers that guard Upper Karazhan, there exists a chance—an opportunity—that an untouched copy of the precious book lies within its depths. The secrets you seek may be held within the hallowed halls, hidden from the ravages of time, awaiting discovery by a determined seeker like you.
Objective: Retrieve a copy of "Vorgendor: Myths from the Blood Dimension" from Upper Karazhan.
