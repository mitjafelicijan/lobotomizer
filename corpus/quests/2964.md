Description: Well $n... we seem to be at a temporary dead end here.We know what we need - the Plates of Uldum - but we have no idea where they might be.We'll need to do quite a bit of research on this to come up with a solid plan of attack.I have a couple ideas where to start looking; I have high hopes that soon, we'll be asking you to head out and recover them.$B$BThe High Explorer needs to be informed on this, $n; no doubt, he also wants to thank you personally for once again aiding the League.
Objective: Speak with High Explorer Magellas in Ironforge.
