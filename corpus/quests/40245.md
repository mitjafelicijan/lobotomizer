Title: The Eldarath Harmonization Gem
Description: I have communed with those closest to me once again, and I am thankful they are safe. More work needs to be done, and hopefully you can be of assistance to me. The Eldarath Harmonization Gem was stolen a long time ago, a band of Naga Raiders led by one named Najhaz. He was able to break my seal upon the tower door and take the Harmonization Gem before I could return to stop him.$B$BIf we Keepers of Azshara are ever meant to travel long distances within the area, this Gem will need to be returned. No doubt that Najhaz the Raider will be among his kin along the shore to the west, kill him, and reclaim the Harmonization Gem for me.
Objective: Search for Najhaz the Raider, kill him, and reclaim the Eldarath Harmonization Gem for Keeper Iselus at the Tower of Eldara in Azshara.
