Title: Scythe of the Goddess
Description: Dark Riders... Their relentless pursuit was swift, sensing my presence the moment I stepped into Duskwood. Fleeing was futile, they hungered for the power of the Scythe, their insatiable desire driving them forward without respite. I fortified my position, calling upon my loyal worgen companions to stand by my side, yet their might proved overwhelming, and I fell beneath their dark influence. In my final act of defiance, I pierced their heart with my spear, knowing my sacrifice would not be in vain.$B$BAlas, it appears that the Scythe was ultimately retrieved by those malevolent beings. I shudder to contemplate the vile purposes they intended to unleash upon the world with its power. It is a relief to know that the artifact now rests within your hands, for I believe there is still hope that you may wield it with its original purpose.$B$BWait. Do you hear that?
Objective: Defeat the Dark Rider.
