Title: Finding Bixxle!
Description: We lost our communication with the Derelict Camp and Bixxle's Storehouse a few weeks ago. Bixxle's Storehouse was the key to profit for our northern harvesting. If we are ever to start up again, I need to know that the place isn't a wreck and covered in monkeys.$B$BMore importantly, Bixxle was a logistical mastermind, as much as his focus tends to drift towards engineering useless contraptions.$B$BHead far to the north, to Bixxle's Storehouse, follow the road, it should take you right to it, see if Bixxle is alive.
Objective: Head to Bixxle's Storehouse in Northern Tel'Abim and report to Bixxle if he is still alive.
