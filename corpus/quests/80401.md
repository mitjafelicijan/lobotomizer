Title: To Build a Pounder
Description: Unfortunately, building a Pounder isn't easy. I will supply most of the components, but I will need you to get me some special things. It is up to you how you go about acquiring them.$B$BI need the following:$B$BA thorium tuned servo for the chassis. I only know of one, and it's been locked up by those Scarlet fanatics. I think the armory is where they store objects they consider heretical. Go get it for me!$B$BIn addition to that, I also need a perfect core for the Pounder. The Dark Iron golems in the Blackrock Depths make a good source. Golem Lord Argelmach probably has one.$B$BThe last component I need is a high quality adamantite rod used for the endoskeleton. I believe Stratholme's forges used to make such rods in the past. I do not know the state of the city, but I believe the rods may still survive there.
Objective: Acquire Thorium Tuned Servo from the Scarlet Monastery's Armory, obtain the Perfect Golem Core in the Blackrocks Depths from Golem Lord Argelmach, find the Adamantite Rod in Stratholme. Return to Oglethorpe Obnoticus.
