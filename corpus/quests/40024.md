Title: Lord Rog's Exiles
Description: My kind have become disconnected from the Elemental Plane here within the Arathi Highlands. Foreign disturbances and the death of our leaders have left us disillusioned and waning in our powers. I have no control over the elementals that I was charged with, and I believe there is more at play here.$B$BTo the southwest is the Circle of Inner Binding. It is where my followers are scattered. Go there, and take from them the Inner Binding Bracers they possess. They will not give them to you willingly, so you must destroy them.
Objective: Gather 5 Inner Binding Bracers from Rock Elementals at the Circle of Inner Binding in Arathi Highlands.
