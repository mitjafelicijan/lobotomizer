And he's cracking jokes about how even an ogre knows how to pitch a tent!$B$BLook, $N, help me out here so I don't make a complete fool of myself.$B$BWe're going to need some cloth to repair these tents and apparently those ogres to the west may have what we're looking for. But, believe me, I have no idea what that dwarf is talking about!
