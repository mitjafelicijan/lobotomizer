Title: Raene's Cleansing
Description: You'll have to do the research yourself, but from what notes Teronis has made, it sounds like your next course of action is to find the other pieces of the rod Dartol created. I would start by heading to the moonwell east of Iris Lake. When you're ready, follow the road and turn north when you reach a small sitting area on your left.$B$BA dryad there named Shael'dryn is better suited to guide you. Seek her out.$B$BKeep the gem with you--Shael'dryn will need it if she's to help you recreate the rod.
Objective: Find Shael'dryn at the moonwell to the northeast.
