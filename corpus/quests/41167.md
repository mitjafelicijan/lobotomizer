Title: The Murloc Threat
Description: Okay, listen up, buddy. You hate murlocs, right? Perfect. Everyone hates murlocs, those who don't end up as their meal real fast. And I for one don't want to be held responsible if any of our workers become some murloc's midnight snack.$B$BI want you to go down to the coast and kill as many fishy fiends as you can. I'd rather be busy beating slobs back into working shape than to deal with those slimy creatures. And don't think of just pretending to kill them or I'll drag you to the Supreme Overseer myself. Prove to me you're reliable by bringing me their scales.
Objective: Hunt murlocs on the shores of Blackstone Island and present twenty of their scales to Bruiser Rakklan.
