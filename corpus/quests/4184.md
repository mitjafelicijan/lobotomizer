Title: The True Masters

There is no possible way that Lakeshire could survive an attack from both the Blackrock orcs and the black dragonflight. Should Lakeshire fall to this menace, Darkshire would fall next, and then what? Goldshire? Stormwind itself?$B$BYou must take this information to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon in Stormwind at once! If this does not merit the aid of Stormwind, nothing will and all is lost.
