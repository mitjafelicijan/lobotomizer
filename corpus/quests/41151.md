Title: Haywire Havoc
Description: It would seem all of my creations have gone rogue. First it was the Whirling Whizzbots wandering aimlessly, and now it's my Battlechickens. They started running amok just a few nights ago. First ignoring commands, and now being a large nuisance to the working environment. I first created them to shoo away wildlife, and now they are causing more problems than they are worth.$B$BThink you can do me a favor and clear out some of the Battlechickens? Once there are fewer of them running around, I should be able to actually think about a new replacement.
Objective: Slay 8 Haywire Battlechickens around the Black Ash Coalpits for Balnack Copperlight.
