Title: Back to Falgran
Description: <Sputtervale focuses on the tablet.>$B$BTheir writing is not exactly like ours. They just draw some pictures, and you have to interpret it on your own. There are some clues that help you with grasping the meaning but...$B$BYou probably aren't interested in quillboar lore, yeah.$B$BSo, what I get from this: a band of quillboars wants to attack an inn. They go there with a raiding party, but they find the inn already burned to the ground. Then some angry pictures. I guess they wanted violence.$B$BSo, yeah. This is what I got from this, pal.
Objective: Report back to Falgran on the border with Barrens.
