Title: Tome of the Cabal
Description: This is one of the most interesting texts I have perused in the last few years. The selection here is sparse--mostly books on geography--and I have already read them all. I should hope that Strahad would send me a copy of this tome when he has the chance.$b$bSpeaking of him, he sent word to me while you were away. For your task, you must obtain three rods of channeling.$b$bFor allowing me to look at this text, I will share a secret: You can find the rods on orcs of the Dragonmaw Clan in the Wetlands.
Objective: Bring the Reconstructed Tome and 3 Rods of Channeling to Strahad Farsan in Ratchet.
