Title: An Ambassador of Evil
Description: Ambassador Infernus was sent to Angor Fortress by Ragnaros himself to mind the Shadowforge seeking lost artifacts in Uldaman.$B$BIt has already meant tremendous casualties for our people, but it has obviously grown worse. I hesitate to guess how many artifacts they would be able to find and use against Ironforge.$B$BOur goal is simple, $c. Return to the Badlands and destroy Ambassador Infernus. Once the threat is eliminated, return to Advisor Belgrum with proof of your victory.$B$BIt is in your hands now.
Objective: Kill Ambassador Infernus in Angor Fortress and bring proof of his death to Advisor Belgrum in Ironforge.
