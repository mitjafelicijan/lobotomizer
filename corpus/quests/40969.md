Title: Crystalvein Ore
Description: Working with sturdy Gilnean ore is no small feat, let me tell ya. But there were times when I yearned for something more exotic, especially when the Greymane Walls closed shut. Oh, the longing I felt!$B$BBut now fate has smiled upon me. Finally, I've been given a chance to once again lay my skilled hands on those rare ores. There's one ore in particular that holds a special place in my heart, Crystalvein. Back in the days of my apprenticeship, I had the honor of working with it. It was a beauty, I tell yaâ€”strong, durable, and a joy to forge. Having that ore by our side would be a true blessing for the rebellion.$B$BSadly, Crystalvein is a treasure found only in the distant lands of Stranglethorn. If, by some stroke of luck, you happen to set foot in Booty Bay, seek out a goblin by the name of Crank. He used to be my go-to supplier for that precious ore. Tell him I sent ya, and maybe, just maybe, he'll be able to hook you up with some Crystalvein once again.
Objective: Find Crank in Booty Bay.
