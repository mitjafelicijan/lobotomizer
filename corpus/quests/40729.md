Title: Collecting Specimens
Description: My research has only just begun and already there are so many possibilities it is making my head spin!$B$BWhat do you mean you have no idea what I am talking about? I am trying to discover the secrets of the Gargantuan Banana, rumor has it that they used to grow on Tel'abim long ago, that was until they were all harvested.$B$BNow all that remains is myth and legend, but I will get to the bottom of it!$B$BMy first hunch comes from strange banana's grown on the island just off the coast to the east, I haven't really had much luck, murlocs you see are all along the coast, and I am but one gnome, perhaps you can go there, and gather me three samples of the 'Strange Tel'abim Banana' that grows there.
Objective: Travel to the small island east of Tazzo's Shack, and collect 3 Strange Tel'abim Banana's for Tazzo at Tazzo's Shack in Tel'abim.
