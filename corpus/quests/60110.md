Title: Githyiss the Vile
Description: Iverron was attacked, you say? And by Githyiss herself, outside the Shadowthread Cave? This is grave news... To think that the broodmother of the webwood spiders has become this hostile.$B$BI had already heard rumors of her mercilessly overhunting the local wildlife. If she has gone so far as to attack our people, however... It pains me to say this, but I fear that she must be put down. Her violent nature now threatens the very balance of Shadowglen.$B$BTake great caution if you are to hunt her, $N; her poison is much stronger than any of her brood's. If you could, please bring back her venom sac so that I may further my research. I only hope it may yield answers to what is happening across Teldrassil.
Objective: Kill Githyiss the Vile and collect her Venom Sac, then return to Gilshalan Windwalker.
