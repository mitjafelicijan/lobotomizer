Title: Sharing the Land
Description: $N, there are many conflicts that wound this land. It is my hope that you will not bear witness to as many of them as I have. Yet there is one that I would ask you to seek out. It will give you some sense of how terrible, if left unchecked, even a small threat can be to the land.$B$BPalemane gnolls have settled to the south of Bloodhoof and in a cave to the west. They disrespect our attempts to communicate with them, and they slay the wildlife of Mulgore unbridled.$B$BWords are no longer the answer.
Objective: Kill 10 Palemane Tanners, 8 Palemane Skinners, and 5 Palemane Poachers, then return to Baine Bloodhoof in Bloodhoof Village.
