Title: The Hermit
Description: There was an old man who used to come into town to buy supplies rather frequently, but I haven't seen him for quite some time now. He lives out in a shack overlooking Raven Hill cemetery, if I remember correctly. Perhaps you should go see if something is amiss.
Objective: Check on the old man in the shack near Raven Hill cemetery.
