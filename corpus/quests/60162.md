Title: Taming the Beast
Description: Alright, on to the last one. Personally for me, taming any flying animal is the most difficult. They’re just too evasive. But perhaps you are more skilled than I am in that regard. From experience, however, I can tell you this: the most elusive beasts make for the greatest compatriots.$B$BNorth of here near the Water Hole and to the east you’ll find Ashfeather Swoopers, tame one and return to me. This is your final lesson. Give it everything you have!
Objective: Tame a Ashfeather Swooper using the Taming Rod and return to Mayten Boomrifle at Rustgate Ridge.
