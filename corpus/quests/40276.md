Title: Destroying the Deeptide
Description: You did well, you have the tenacity and strength of the most well rounded explorers. If we truly want the Deeptide gone, and to free these islands of their presence we must become more bold. Their leadership are nestled within the Deeptide Sanctum, and need to be rooted out.$B$BReturn to the sanctum, and bring retribution upon Princess Shasza, and Tidelord Hakash, they need to be slain for their crimes and hostility. Trust me, there is no reasoning, or diplomacy that can be done, finish this, and perhaps the Naga will disperse.
Objective: Slay Tidelord Hakash, and Princess Shasza for Explorer Fangosh in Maul'ogg Refuge.
