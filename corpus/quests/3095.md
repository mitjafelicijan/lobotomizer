Title: Simple Scroll
Description: Ah, while you were off dealing with the mindless Scourge, this scroll arrived for you. I would think it's some matter of importance as it seems it bears the seal of the warrior trainer Dannal. I would take some time to read it before heading out again.
Objective: Read the Simple Scroll and speak to Dannal Stern in Deathknell.
