Title: I See Alcaz Island In Your Future...
Description: As I was saying, $c, in my living years I flirted with becoming a diviner. But, there really wasn't as much profit in it as you might imagine, mostly because it's dangerous and the reagents are rare and expensive. However, I do know enough to be able to pinpoint the final piece of the amulet, and the spirit of my former comrade along with it.$B$BThis is where you come in, $N. I need you to go to Alcaz Island off the coast of Dustwallow Marsh and collect Bloodkelp from the Strashaz naga that live there.
Objective: Gather 20 Bloodkelp from the Strashaz naga and then return to Bodley inside Blackrock Mountain.
