The Maul Orb was created in those days, and since the tribes split, it has been lost in their hands.$B$BThere is no doubt that the Maul Orb still exists, tucked away within the Gor'dosh Heights, the Heights are located on Lapidis Isle, far to the north, on its north western edge, go there, and recover it.
