Title: The Stockade's Search
Description: Ahh yes, I had only figured a report from Robb would eventually lead back to this man. You may know him as Harlus Ashbuckle , but in truth that is nothing more then a false identity. The man you're gathering information on is actually Martin Corinth who hails from Lordaeron. He escaped south to Stormwind during the Third War and was recently let free from imprisonment.$B$BSomeone from the House of Nobles delayed his execution and eventually got his release with a vow from the man to swear off his practices and be exiled from the land. I kept a close eye on him, knowing just how much potential power he had within the dark arts.$B$BI would like to tie up some loose ends before simply having the man killed for his practices, I wish to figure out who else may be behind all of this forbidden magic, and what Noble set him free.$B$BThe Stockades has recently been over run, but it is the last location that holds information valuable to this Martin Corinth, go there and find it.
Objective: Delve into the Stockades and find information on Martin Corinth. Report your findings to Mathias Shaw.
