Title: Lighting the Pyres
Description: When we first got here, it was important for us to raise structures to make a home for ourselves. While tidying the place up, we breached the entrance of the temple, clearing away all the collapsed rubble.$B$BMany loa used to be worshipped there, especially the Loa of Death. We must have disturbed the spirits inside the tomb, because the trolls of the past have arisen to haunt the temple. These vengeful undead attack anyone who tries to walk their halls, even peaceful worshippers.$B$BYa duty is to set fire to the pyres in the tomb, to soothe the troubled spirits and purify the temple. If the undead be in ya way, send them back to the afterlife.
Objective: Light 8 Spirit Pyres inside the tomb.
