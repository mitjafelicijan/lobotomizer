Title: James Hyal
Description: My brother James went with Lady Proudmoore across the sea. Last I heard, the fighting had settled down over there, and James was setting up an inn somewhere on the continent. Wherever he is, I'm sure he's doing good business. Damn fine cook he was.$b$bI haven't heard from him for a while now--too busy with his inn, I'd wager--but the clerk in Theramore could probably point you to him.
Objective: Speak with Clerk Lendry in Theramore.
