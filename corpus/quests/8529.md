Title: The Alliance Needs More Spotted Yellowtail!
Description: If you're still willing I'd like to send you back out to bring in another haul of spotted yellowtail, $N. I'd imagine with the expertise you gained the first time out that this catch should be much faster and easier. Are you game?
Objective: Bring 20 spotted yellowtail to Huntress Swiftriver at the airfield in Dun Morogh.
