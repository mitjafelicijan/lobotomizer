Title: Reagents for Reclaimers Inc.
Description: This is the last of the items, and I won't lie, it ain't pretty. I'm also expecting this to take you a little bit longer than the other items.$B$BSo, enough with the warning, let's get this started. Leftwitch says he needs: ten brains from either mana eaters, mage hunters, or ley hunters. Ten nether wings from a nether maiden, sister or sorceress. And... ten vials of doomwarder blood from a doomwarder captain, or lord.$B$BSimple enough, huh? Sheesh... if you wanna pass on this one, I'd understand.
Objective: Bring 10 Felhound Brains, 10 Nether Wings, and 10 vials of Doomwarder Blood to Kreldig Ungor in Desolace.
