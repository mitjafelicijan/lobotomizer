Title: A Little Help From My Friends
Description: Ugh... It's so hot...$B$BI was exploring this area, when all of a sudden, the heat just became unbearable. I must be suffering from heat exhaustion.$B$BPlease, help me get back to my friend Spraggle at Marshal's Refuge. I think I'm well enough to follow you there.$B$BI am feeling a little out of it, so if I do happen to faint again, just splash some water on me from Spraggle's canteen. That should work, I hope...
Objective: Lead Ringo to Spraggle Frock at Marshal's Refuge.$B$BIf Ringo faints, use Spraggle's Canteen to revive him.
