Title: The Ruins of Isildien
Description: Long ago, during the reign of Queen Azshara, this place thrived as a center of Kaldorei civilization. Now, all that remains are ruins, either occupied by ogres or tainted by undeath.$B$BThe downfall of this place was brought about by arcane magic, and it's hard to feel pity for those who met their end here. Yet, amidst all this arcane corruption, there once stood a place of purity and light—the old Temple of Elune, its name lost to the annals of time.$B$BWithin the temple, the priestesses safeguarded a sacred artifact deeply connected to the roots of our people and the world we inhabit. I require this artifact, but my duties prevent me from leaving the camp at this moment. If fate ever guides you to the Ruins of Isildien, seek out the Tear of Zalmos—a precious blue gem of unimaginable importance. Your aid in retrieving it would be invaluable.
Objective: Find the Tear of Zalmos in the Temple of Elune in the Ruins of Isildien and bring it back to Larodar at Thalanaar in Feralas.
