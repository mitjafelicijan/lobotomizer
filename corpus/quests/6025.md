Title: Unfinished Business
Description: What? Really? You want to know more? But you've already done so much for me, $N. I couldn't possibly ask you to enter Hearthglen itself on my behalf.$B$BAre you sure, $N? Hearthglen is much more dangerous than the Pass--I cannot provide you any protectionor even information about what you might face.$B$BWell, if you really are willing to help, then enter the town and find a high place to gain a good view of the town. From there you can gauge their numbers and report them back to me. But be careful....
Objective: Enter Hearthglen and find a high vantage point from which you can see the town and gauge the Scarlet Crusade's forces, then return to Kirsta Deepshadow in Western Plaguelands.
