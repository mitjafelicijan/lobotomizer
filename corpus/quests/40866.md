Title: Dark Iron Technology
Description: Ever since we left Tinker Town, there have been messages of a raid near Ironband's Compound to the south east. You would suspect Troggs to be behind such a thing, but no, Dark Irons are here in Dun Morogh.$B$BWhilst this is alarming, it could also prove to be a chance to get ahold of some Dark Iron Technology. I do know that there are some skilled engineers and magic users amongst their ranks, and I want to see first hand what they are capable of.$B$BHead down there, and take what you can find. Bring it back to me so I can do some studying.
Objective: Gather Dark Iron Technology at Ironband's Compound for Tenner Pipegadge at the Gnomeregan Reclamation Facility in Dun Morogh.
