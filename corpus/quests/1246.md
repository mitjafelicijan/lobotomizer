Title: The Missing Diplomat
Description: Yeah, now that I think about it... Dashel... Dashel something... What was his name? FIST! Dashel Stonefist. They call him Fist in some circles--probably on account that he likes to get in brawls.$B$BYou can find him in Old Town usually--right smack dab in the center of it. Go talk to him. If you have to, use a sword or something heavy and blunt to persuade him to open up some. And don't hesitate. If he's in this as deep as these papers suggest, then he's not going to give you any information willingly.
Objective: Speak to Dashel Stonefist in Stormwind.
