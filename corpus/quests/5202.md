Title: A Strange Red Key
Description: The small red key seems to be made of some kind of bone material. It is heavy in your hand, but appears very fragile. Why would a member of the Shadow Council have such a thing? Perhaps there is something within Jaedenar that this strange key unlocks.
Objective: Search through Jaedenar to discover what the Blood Red Key is used for.
