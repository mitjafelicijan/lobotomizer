Title: The Blood Elf Intrusion
Description: Our scouts have confirmed new presence in the area of Felwood, foreign interlopers from a far off land, loyal to outside forces from a far away land.$B$BWhat they are doing here, I am unsure of, but who they are, I am certain.$B$BThey are Blood Elves, loyal to their prince and the demon hunter Illidan. I am certain they are up to no good, and whatever plans they have, I would like to halt. You can find them gathered around an old statue of the betrayer near the Shatter Scar Vale just north east of Bloodvenom Falls, go there, and collect seven Blood Elf Badges.$B$BPerhaps they will get the message and return to where they came.
Objective: Gather 7 Blood Elf Badges from the Blood Elf Loyalists around the Shrine of the Betrayer for Torgen Blackscar at Bloodvenom Post in Felwood.
