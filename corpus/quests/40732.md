Title: Two Favors For The Price of One
Description: Hello again mule, ready for work?$B$BI will be honest, I aint sticking around on this rock as Tel Co. burns to the ground, and to get my way out, I need materials, ones a goblin can't find back on Kezan.$B$BAll around the jungle are these flying serpents with wings. They go by the moniker 'Venomflayer', you see, they have a really potent Sac deep within them, and it is this Venomflayer Sac that I am looking for. Lets make it eight of them, bring me eight, and I'll tell you about this stupidly large banana.
Objective: Collect 8 Venomwing Sacs for Leezza Fraxtoggle at Tel Co. Basecamp in Tel'abim.
