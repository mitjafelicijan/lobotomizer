Title: The Woodpaw Gnolls
Description: Our "friends" the Woodpaw might have gotten Raschal in the end, but something tells me that's not what occurred.Still, they're the best place to start looking.$B$BI wish I had clearer insight as to what to do, but all I have right now is 'Search the Woodpaw camps - go.'I do know that gnolls will keep items they scavenge and fight over them; maybe they ran across the backpacks Quint mentioned.I hadn't risked a head-on fight in past searches, but with Quint's vision on this I say rip into them.
Objective: Search the Woodpaw Gnoll camps of southern Feralas for evidence of the courier's belongings or the courier himself.
