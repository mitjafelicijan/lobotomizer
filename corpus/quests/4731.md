Title: Beached Sea Turtle
Description: Another set of sea turtle remains lie beached on the coastline.This set of remains has an abandoned carriage half buckled to the turtle's shell.Perhaps this creature was driven to the shoreline by unknown beings rather than beaching itself as some of the other remains suggested.Powerful Greymist murlocs have made the carcass of this creature their current home.$B$BIn the carriage, you find a box with strange markings on it; perhaps Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine can make sense of it.
Objective: Take the Strangely Marked Box to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine.
