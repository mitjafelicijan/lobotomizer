Title: Taming the Beast
Description: As Quel'dorei, our intrinsic connection to magic sets us apart. Yet, in the realm of beasts, there exists a creature born of the pure mana of the Sunwell â€“ the mana wyrms. Your ultimate challenge lies in taming a Lavender Mana Wyrm, dwelling amidst the southern hills.$B$BIf you can successfully tame this creature, you'll not only assert mastery over the beast but also showcase your prowess in the arcane arts. The Lavender Mana Wyrm represents a fusion of our elven heritage and the magical energies that course through Azeroth. May your endeavors prove you a true master of both.
Objective: Use the Taming Rod to tame an Lavender Mana Wyrm. Practice your skills, then return the Taming Rod to Damilara Sunsorrow in Alah'Thalas.
