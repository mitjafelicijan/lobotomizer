Title: Stolen Oil
Description: It was about a week ago now when the damned Mirefin raided my Lighthouse and got off with all manner of supply I had been building up. A few weeks of food rations and some tools, but most importantly oil for the Lighthouse!$B$BThe Lighthouse in Theramore runs from oil collected in other parts of the world, and of which we only get a shipment in at the start of every month, without it, the Lighthouse will die out. I do not need to tell you how vital this Lighthouse is especially for a port city like Theramore.$B$BI ask of you to gather it back from the Mirefin Murlocs, no doubt they have it stashed among their hovels up to the north west, make sure to check the isles there, they practically infest them.
Objective: Gather the Lighthouse Oil Barrel for Old Bryan at the Theramore Lighthouse.
