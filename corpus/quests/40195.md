Title: The Razzari Leaders
Description:  With the Hazzuri's dark words they were able to convince the weak minds of the Razzari to take up their magic. Even now their speaker gives them speeches to warp their minds and change their ideals.$B$BI have discovered from the Mojo you have sent me of a dark taint that lingers within it, it would appear that the power my people have become to accept is that of a great power, and a much greater evil. The Hazzuri know not what they peddle, nor what they preach, and will only bring the end of their kind, and my own.$B$BIf there is to be a future for the Razzari, this must all come to an end, and the only end I can see, is by the death of those that accepted this darkness. They are nothing more then traitors for a promise of power.$B$BGo deep into Zul'Razar, strike hard at Speaker Ujuwa for spreading his lies, and Chief Imaz'ul for accepting them. Bring me their skulls as proof of your deeds, let this chaos come to an end.
Objective: Collect the skulls of Speaker Ujuwa and Chief Imaz'ul for Jubo in Maul'ogg Refuge.
