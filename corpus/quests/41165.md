Title: Dry As A Desert
Description: What do you think the most important thing on this island is? Water, ofcourse! Taxxlo was a good answer, buddy, but even he has to admit that we cannot keep the workers going if they're shriveled up like a deep-fried plantain.$B$BTo the north, past the mines, you will find Blackstone's waterhole. Pumpmaster Galvax was ordered to send a shipment of water here to Rustgate Ridge, but this has taken longer than I'd like it to have. Ask him what is taking so long!
Objective: Pumpmaster Galvax at The Water Hole can tell you more about the missing water delivery.
