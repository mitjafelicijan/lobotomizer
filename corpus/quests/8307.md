Title: Desert Recipe
Description: Adapting to life in the desert has been difficult to say the least.Not only do I miss the birds and trees of Auberdine but our food selection is severely limited by this arid environment.I'm trying to learn about desert herbs, but there aren't many.$B$BI've seen Twilight's Hammer groups from the camp west of here hunt sandworms for food.Sandworm meat is so bitter though, I can't imagine how they make it palatable.Keep your eyes open if you go to their camp and let me know if you learn anything.
Objective: Look for information about cooking Sandworm Meat at the Twilight's Hammer camp west of Cenarion Hold.
