Title: The Maul'ogg Crisis VIII
Description: With the elements recovered, and the Atal'ai Rod in posession, I can now begin to manifest my energies into the creation of an elixir. This elixir will bring the mind of Lord Cruk'Zogg into the hands of Haz'gorg to do as he pleases.$B$BThis will require some concentration on my part, so I do ask you mortal, to keep your mouth quiet while I work.
Objective: Wait for Insom'ni to finish his magic, then return to Haz'gorg the Great Seer.
