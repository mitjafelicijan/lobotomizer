Title: Disruption at Rustgate Lumber Yard
Description: When we first arrived on this island, it was a lush and green oasis, full of trees and wildlife. We turned a great profit with the Rustgate Lumber Yard just to the northeast of here and all of that profit has come to a crashing halt.$B$BBelieve it or not, there are still quite a few trees that we could harvest, yet the Venture Co. has taken claim to one of our most lucrative sources of revenue! I've even heard they are working out of it themselves, such nerve!$B$BI require you to head to the Rustgate Lumber Yard and start cracking some heads, make the Venture Co. think twice before messing with the Durotar Labor Union again.
Objective: Slay Venture Co. around the Rustgate Lumber Yard for Supervisor Ozzick at Rustgate Ridge on Blackstone Island.
