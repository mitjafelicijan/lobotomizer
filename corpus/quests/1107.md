Title: Encrusted Tail Fins
Description: Our rocket car is the fastest thing on the flats!So fast that ... I'm afraid friction is going to tear it apart!$B$BTo prevent that I need to create a composite to coat the car's moving parts.It must be hard but not brittle, and must be resistant to salt corrosion, or time spent on the Shimmering Flats will eat it away.$B$BHave you heard of the Vile Reef, $N?It's off the coast of Stranglethorn Vale.Saltscale murlocs live there, and their tail fins are a crucial ingredient of my composite.
Objective: Bring 10 Encrusted Tail Fins to Wizzle Brassbolts in the Shimmering Flats.
