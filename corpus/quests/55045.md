Title: Ore on Time
Description: Look, I meant to get the ore to him, I promise. It's just been rather stressful day after day to smash a pick against rock, I feel like I can do better things, you know?$B$BYou mind doing me a favor and finding me 10 copper ore? Theres tons of it around the region here if you can mine, or if you know someone who can. It would get me all caught up on my shipments and dues and even have me a little ahead!$B$BI could really use the help. There's always the auction house if you don't know anyone and can't mine yourself.
Objective: Bring 10 Copper Ore to Big Fraggle for Miner Axel.
