Title: The Human Anatomy
Description: Being an undead for so long has made me forget some things about human anatomy. Since we have an annoying specimen in the room next to us, how about you get rid of him and bring me his head? That way I can study it without him screaming. Don't worry, he's already out of the cage.$B$BBy the way, I will show you how to disguise as a human if you bring me his head in good conditions.
Objective: Get rid of the Annoying Peasant and bring his head to Professor Malkovich.
