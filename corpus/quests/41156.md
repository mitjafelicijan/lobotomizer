Title: Foreman's Blues
Description: Don't get ahead of yourself. The only thing separating you from a hobgoblin is your work speed and even that has a whole lot of room for improvement. What better way to do that than to finish more jobs, am I right?$B$BThe local vultures are pestering us and disrupting our work schedule. Foreman Pipelatch down in the pits has been tasked to handle this, but it seems even the goblins with a little bit of control over others panic at the first problem they encounter. Go there and see if you can do something about it.
Objective: Talk to Foreman Pipelatch in the pit just outside.
