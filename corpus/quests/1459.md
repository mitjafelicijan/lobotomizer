Title: Reagents for Reclaimers Inc.
Description: Next on Leftwitch's list is... let's see... hmm. Oh, here it is.$B$BSimple enough, but pretty explicit in his directions. He needs venom from the scorpashi, and hide from some kodo. The fine print says both are from specific creatures: the venom's got to come from any of the scorpashi, and the hide's got to come from an aged kodo, not the dying or ancient ones.$B$BMages, I tell ya, some of the stuff they want... it's just weird.
Objective: Bring 7 vials of Scorpashi Venom and 3 Aged Kodo Hides to Kreldig Ungor in Desolace.
