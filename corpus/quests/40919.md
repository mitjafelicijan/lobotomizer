Title: Focusing on the Mystery
Description: An Arcane Focus is needed to properly channel the powers of the Eye into the crystal. Such foci were common during the height of the Kaldorei civilization, alas, I remember it wellâ€¦ Now what remains of those haughty seats of power, hmm? Ruins. Knowledge lost to time.$B$BYou may, then, think it an impossible task to locate one. Fortunately for you, I will give you a lead. Perhaps one lingers with the Highborne of Dire Maul.
Objective: Acquire an Arcane Focus and bring it to the Mysterious Mailbox.
