Title: Raider's Revenge
Description: I have fought in many battles, against the Alliance, orcs, demons, ogres... Yet I never expected to face my own clan.$B$BMy clan no longer. A few days ago I was patrolling the wastes on my trusty wolf, Skullshatter. I encountered Rend's soldiers. Before I could do anything, they attacked! I was outnumbered. I manged to escape, but they hurt my wolf. I thought it to be only a scratch, as he suffered worse many times. Unfortunately, the arrow was poisoned and he died a few hours later.$B$BI do not mourn his death. This was his purpose, after all. He joined his brothers and will now hunt among the ancestors. But I want revenge. If only I wasn't so severly needed here... $R, go south of here, to the Pillar of Ash and slay as many Blackrock as you can. Bring me their heads. Forty will do.
Objective: Bring 40 Blackrock Heads to Raider Fargosh in Karfang Hold.
