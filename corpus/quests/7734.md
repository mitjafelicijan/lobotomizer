Title: Improved Quality
Description: I have a lead on an even BETTER source of hides, if that's even possible to believe!In the northern parts of Feralas - deep within Rage Scar Hold - are another throng of yetis.They're much tougher than the ones you dealt with before, so if you're up for a bigger challenge you'd best be on your toes!$B$BI would reward you handsomely for a stack of ten of their hides; bring them to me here, and we'll finish our business.
Objective: Bring 10 Rage Scar Yeti Hides to Jangdor Swiftstrider at Camp Mojache, Feralas.
