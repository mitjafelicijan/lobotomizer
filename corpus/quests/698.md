Title: Lack of Surplus
Description: I'm working on getting some supplies together for our outpost near the beach to the east--Tok'kar does what he can, but between shifts of guard duty and cooking for his soldiers there's not much time left in the day.$B$BThey do enjoy cooking up some sawtooth meat when they can, but I haven't had time to get them another shipment. Would you mind helping them out?$B$BThe young sawtooths aren't as tasty as the older ones, so stay clear of those; give them a year or two to get to full size.
Objective: Bring 8 Unprepared Sawtooth Flanks to Tok'Kar in Swamp of Sorrows.
