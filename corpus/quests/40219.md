Title: The Jade Mine
Description: We Maul'ogg used to hold many great riches, we were in the process of setting up a great mine of jade that is present upon Gillijim! Those dirty pirates came and stole all of our hard work and should be smashed! Those rich jades are ours, and that gold they make should be our gold!$B$BOn some of our first digs we uncovered a very large 'Star Emerald', of course, in the chaos it wasn't taken to me! Now some Foreman named Darkskull has it, and I want it back! He oversee's The Jade Mine up to the north west along the coast, go there, kill him, and bring me my prize, maybe they will learn a lesson from this too.
Objective: Claim the Star Emerald for Lord Cruk'Zogg in Maul'ogg Refuge.
