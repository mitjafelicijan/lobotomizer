Used to do a lot of piracy back in my day.$B$BI worked with the Southsea Pirates in taking over boats and just stealing what we wanted to.$B$BIt was one hell of a life, but it came to an abrupt end when a friend of mine got killed in a dispute that another member caused.$B$BLet's just say I took off after that, and didn't look back.$B$BI had a pair of lucky boots during my days in the Southsea Pirates, had 'em most of my life actually from when I left Kezan. They should still be at the Hidden Cove in eastern Tanaris, in my sealed trunk in one of the bunkhouses.$B$BIf you can find 'em, I'll pay you well.
Objective: Find Big Fraggle's Lucky Boots.
