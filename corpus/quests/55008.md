Title: Frix's Folly
Description: Oh, that's why you're here, yeah...$B$BI've been knee deep in research and tinkering to try and find new methods of power and energy for Sparkwater.$B$BI've ran into a few hiccups, mostly with Frix. He's been gone for a few days now and I haven't heard anything from him. Worst of all, I sent the guy with the only working Surveying Gear that we had!$B$BLast thing I knew was that he went south-west to the nearby elvish ruins to go take some surveys and readings around the Satyrs in the area. He's probably gotten himself killed, or worse, captured!$B$BPlease go find him. If you indeed find his corpse, keep an eye out for the Surveying Gear I sent with him!
Objective: Find Frix to the south-west by the elvish ruins.
