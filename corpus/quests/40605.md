Title: The Redbrand Archive
Description: The Redbrand Digsite was a location of both mining and archelogy, many of their records and achievements are recorded in a book named the Redbrand Archive.$B$BI was primarily sent here to recover that book, and return it to Torwyn Redbrand back in Ironforge. If you could do me a favor, and gather that for me, it would mean a lot while I remain and clean up this mess. It should be located within the main building of the digsite, gather it, and bring it to Torwyn, you can find him at the Mystic Ward near the Redbrand Estate.
Objective: Gather the Redbrand Archive and return it to Torwyn Redbrand in Ironforge.
