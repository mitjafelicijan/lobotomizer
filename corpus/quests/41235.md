Title: To Staghelm
Description: This is truly marvelous, beyond any expectation. I had no idea what that Highborne had up her sleeve, but by Elune, to stand before an Ancient that hasn't been seen in millennia...$B$BWord of this must reach the Archdruid! Please, understand. The Ancients are highly revered in the Kaldorei culture, and this will certainly aid me in helping the Quel'dorei. May you reach Darnassus well; I know the Archdruid will see fit to reward you.
Objective: Seek Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus.
