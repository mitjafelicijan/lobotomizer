Title: Ways of Magic
Description: Let me think for a second. Hmm... Why, yes! I have an acquaintance of sorts in the Undercity. The name is Pierce Shackleton. He calls himself a mage, and he owes me a favor, or rather he owes my wife a favor. Take this letter to him along with the box and find out what can be done with it.
Objective: Take the Box and letter to Pierce Shackleton in the Undercity Magic Quarter.
