Title: The Crystal of Zin-Malor
Description: Quite impressive, $N.$B$BThe crystal of Zin-Malor can never be returned to the temple which, as you know, lies in ruin. But I believe that your effort to undo the evil of the past should not go unrewarded.$B$BSeek out Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus, and bring the crystal to him, $N. It should be in the hands of those that will not abuse its power. From the looks of it, only a handful of the strongest magic users would be able to control such a power. 
Objective: Deliver the Crystal of Zin-Malor to Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus.
