Title: Linken's Memory
Description: Oh... Linken? Yeah, he's a funny one. When he first got here, he was mumbling about all kinds of strange things. Probably got bumped on the head pretty hard, I imagine.$B$BSomething he said kinda stuck with me though -- that he was making some sort of totem; said he had to talk to someone named Eridan Bluewind... in a place called Felwood, I think?$B$BI doubt he could tell you much now, though. If you want to know more, maybe you should look for Eridan yourself?
Objective: Find Eridan Bluewind in southern Felwood.
