Title: Torn Soul
Description: Who is there? Hello?! I cannot see you - but I know you're there. Please, whoever you are, help me! There is so much pain, I cannot bear it, it feels like I am being torn asunder every moment of my existence. Countless dark shadows scurry around the houses, pulling and tearing at me. It is like I am at multiple places at once, and my very being wanes at the pressure.$B$BStranger, I beg of you, find the pieces missing from me! They are moving... at different places! End my torture by all that is holy!
Objective: Find the pieces of Miriam Lenheim's body. Bring them to her on the Forlorn Summit.
