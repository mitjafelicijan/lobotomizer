Title: Reappearance of the Damned
Description: Welcome to the Glenshire. I hope that you have come to assist us. The enemies on every side beset us, and we could surely use any help we could get. West of here is a farm where a large battle occurred recently between our troops and humans of Lordaeron. We planned to use the dead there to boost our troops, but the Cult of the Damned appeared before us with the same idea.$B$BIf left unchecked, the Scourge will soon have a large force to attack from the west, and we cannot let that happen. If you are feeling up to it, I got a reward ready for anyone willing to put a stop to the Scourge advances.
Objective: Father Brightcopf wants to put a stop to Scourge's advances on the Corinth Farm.
