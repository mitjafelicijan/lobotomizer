Title: Provisions for Refugees
Description: The Regency Council has bestowed upon me the responsibility of providing sustenance and shelter for all those who seek refuge in this land. A task, noble in intent, but one burdened by a stark lack of resources.$B$BThe local boar population is abundant, a potential source of nourishment for our people. However, the reality is harshâ€”many here lack the necessary equipment or skills to hunt them down. It falls upon shoulders willing and able to bridge this gap.$B$BIf you have the means and the skill, could you gather at least ten young boar flanks for our cause? It would be a tremendous help in easing the hunger that gnaws at the spirits of those who have sought safety here.
Objective: Bring 10 Young Thalassian Boar Flanks to Commander Anarileth in Brinthillien.
