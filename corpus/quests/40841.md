Title: Behind The Wall
Description: Have you heard of the tidings from the north? The Greymane Wall lies open at last.$B$BI never thought I would see the day after hearing all the horrible things I did, and by the sounds of it, things don't bode well. Still, within Gilneas City one of my dearest friends used to work with a rare material called 'Dawnstone' which could only be found within Gilneas itself.$B$BI have no doubt his patterns are still within his shop in the city, and I ask you to recover them for me. I would advise to bring some comrades in arms along with you; word has it that there is unrest, entailing worgen and civil war, so it certainly is not a safe place to venture alone.
Objective: Venture into Gilneas City and recover the Dawnstone Plans for Therum Deepforge in Stormwind.
