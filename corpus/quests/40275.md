Title: Deeptide Sanctum
Description: It is good to meet a fellow explorer upon these lands, one who enjoys the same glory of finding the unknown and uncovering secrets. We share a bond in exploration and adventure and I feel obligated to warm you of a danger off the coast, one that perhaps you may assist with.$B$BThe Deeptide Naga are a menacing force, who came here for an unknown motive and currently hold an island off the coast of Gillijim to the south west. It is there that they have a sanctum they call home, and use it as a base of operations to strike out and attack people like you and me. I was lucky to escape the hands of these slithering marauders and live to tell the tale, but others are not so lucky.$B$BI ask you to travel to the Deep Tide Sanctum, and slay the Naga there, so that one day the horde may establish control on these islands, and so that we may continue our exploration unharmed. Bring me the bracelets they wear as proof.
Objective: Gather 10 Deeptide Bracelets from Deeptide Naga for Explorer Fangosh in Maul'ogg Refuge.
