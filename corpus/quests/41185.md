Title: War On Mudpaw
Description: If these Venture Co. folk up there weren't enough, just beyond this measly pond are the grubby paws of the gnolls, cackling and growling at us. All. The. Time. If I weren't busy guarding these dunderheads here, I'd get my bludgeon and teach them a lesson or two myself. But I can't. And it makes me mad.$B$BEager to earn some coin? Bash some of their heads in and I'll make it worth your while. Bring me their armbands as proof, I don't trust anyone's word here - and you'd do the same if you know what's best for you.
Objective: Collect Mudpaw Armbands from Mudpaw Gnolls for Bruiser Yevo at The Water Hole.
