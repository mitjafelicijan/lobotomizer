Title: Against the Hatecrest
Description: At this point, I am going to direct you to my second, Latronicus.He's been keeping a close eye on the naga forces to date.I'll assess the general situation here in regards to the naga; as much as I want to commit a full force to move against them, leaving the stronghold open to direct attack from the Horde - or worse - seems less than optimal.$B$BAnyway, Latronicus awaits.Good work thus far, $n.Keep it up.$B$BYou're dismissed.
Objective: Report to Latronicus Moonspear in Feathermoon Stronghold.
