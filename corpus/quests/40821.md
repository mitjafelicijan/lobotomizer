Title: The Key to Karazhan V
Description: <Magus Halister carefully combs through the pages of thick tomes, his eyes scanning every line with an intensity that speaks of decades of study and experience. After several minutes of diligent searching, he finally looks up at you with a wry smile.>$B$BAh, yes. Vandol. He was here, in Theramore, some four years ago. Paid a visit to Lady Jaina, in fact. But he did not stay in the city for long. Found it too bustling for an old man like him, I suppose.$B$BAccording to our records, Vandol purchased a small boat not long after his visit. Loaded it up with vital supplies, food, and even seeds, if you can believe it. He set sail for the south, seeking a quieter life, I imagine. The coastline would be your best bet if you seek to find him.
Objective: Find Vandol. He is living somewhere on the eastern coast of Kalimdor, south of Theramore.
