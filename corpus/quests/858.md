Title: Ignition
Description: I don't suppose Sputtervalve sent you? I'm in a bind here. I hopped in without realizing that I need a key to unlock the shredder's movement column. One of the other shredder operators asked me if everything was okay, and I panicked! Instead of telling him that I was missing my key, I told him there was some sort of mechanical problem.$b$bWe need to get out of here on the double! Go up to the control room at the top of the derrick, the supervisor should have a key for this shredder.$b$bHelp me out here!
Objective: Get the Ignition Key and bring it to Wizzlecrank.
