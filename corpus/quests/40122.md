Title: The Azshara Dampening
Description: I received word from a colleague within Azshara quite some time ago about powerful energy that is dampening magic within the region. If such a threat could pose itself close to Dalaran, then much of our spells, magic, and protections would be nullified.$B$BI would like you to travel there. Assess if this will threaten Dalaran itself and see if action is needed. You can find Magus Bromley located just south of the Ruins of Eldarath camped upon the ridgeline. Seek him out and get answers.
Objective: Head to Magus Bromley in Azshara.
