Title: Against the Hatecrest
Description: The best course of action at this point is to assume that, regardless of what the naga are up to, they will eventually move to secure the island for their own.We need to take aggressive steps to counter that threat before it is too late.$B$BBring me ten Hatecrest Scales that are in good condition; it should be obvious to you how to acquire them.You'll cut your teeth on the naga for the first time, and we'll have a weakened naga presence on Sardor Isle - both are prospects that play to our advantage.
Objective: Bring 10 Hatecrest Naga Scales to Latronicus Moonspear in Feathermoon Stronghold.
