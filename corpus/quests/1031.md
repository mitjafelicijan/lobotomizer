Title: The Branch of Cenarius
Description: Anilia puts her hands on your shoulders and draws you close. Gasping, she points towards the arch to the north, before her eyes close and her last wheezing breath leaves her body. "He has taken it... Geltharis..." You know in your heart that Anilia's dying wish is to see the Branch of Cenarius back in dryad hands.
Objective: Kill Geltharis and return the Branch of Cenarius to Illiyana at the Shrine of Aessina.
