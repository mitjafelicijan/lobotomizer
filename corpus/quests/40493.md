Title: Fueling the Blood Fury
Description: This region does not possess the potency that I am looking for, but I do know a place that does.$B$BFar to the southeast is the Blasted Lands. It is where I came into this world, in awe by it's skies and the lush swamp. All that remains now is a hellish wasteland akin to what the Outland is.$B$BIt is there that demons rove the land and the energies of the Dark Portal itself fester and pulse.$B$BGo there, and kill a Felguard Sentry that watches the portal, bring me a Large Felguard Heart.
Objective: Bring a Large Felguard Heart from the Blasted Lands to Darkseer Geshtol at Karfang Hold in Burning Steppes.
