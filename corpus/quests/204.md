Title: Bad Medicine
Description: To have a chance against Kurzen, we need his healing support neutralized.He has gathered around him a large number of Medicine Men who heal his forces with Jungle Remedies and poison our fighters with Venom Fern Extracts.$B$BWe need those remedies to cure our own people, and we need a sample of those extracts to study so we can make our own remedies.Search the Kurzen Compound for both - his Medicine Men will have the remedies, and the extracts are probably stowed in some of the camp's supply boxes.
Objective: Bring 7 Jungle Remedies and 1 Venom Fern Extract to Sergeant Yohwa at the Rebel Camp.
