Title: Fel Energy Irregularities III
Description: It would appear that fel energy has indeed begun to ripple across the Blasted Lands, sending the region into a swirl of irregularities, and unstable conditions. Let us hope this is simply caused from the Dark Portal itself, and not its reactivation.$B$BIt will take many more of our kin to keep everything under control.$B$BNow then, I am asking you to deliver an important letter, one that is magically sealed, breaking it, will destroy the parchment.$B$BI trust that you will do for the good of the Kirin Tor, and for the Alliance itself.$B$BMake sure this reaches Mahar Ba, so that he may begin the neccesary tests and preparations.
Objective: Return to Nethergarde, and deliver the Magically Sealed Dalaran Report to Watcher Mahar Ba.
