Title: Find the Gems and Power Source
Description: Here is the journal, translated for you to read on your own.The crux of it says dwarves hid the ruby, the troggs hid the topaz, and a trogg named Grimlok has the sapphire.$B$BLook - you're going to need a power source to make the necklace work again.Dran Droffers doesn't know this.To find one, here's what I'd do: go as deep as you can in Uldaman and kill whatever construct there is the strongest.No doubt whatever that is would have it.$B$BWhen you have everything collected, come back here!
Objective: Recover all three gems and a power source for the necklace from Uldaman, and then bring them to Jarkal Mossmeld in Kargath.Jarkal believes a power source might be found on the strongest construct present in Uldaman.$B$BFrom the journal, you know...$B* The ruby has been stashed in a barricaded Shadowforge area.$B* The topaz has been hidden in an urn in one of the Trogg areas, near some Alliance dwarves.$B* The sapphire has been claimed by Grimlok, the trogg leader.
