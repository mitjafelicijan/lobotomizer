Title: The Shadowsworn Enemy
Description: The Shadowsworn cultists have been giving us a hard time here. In the last two days we faced three attacks from them. They were weak, and we managed to fend them off. I fear that in the future, they will send a bigger force.$B$BWe need to act quicker. Venture into the wasteland, find their strongholds, and thin their ranks. Buy us more time.
Objective: Slay 12 Shadowsworn Cultists and 8 Shadowsworn Thugs for Jaiymu in the Blasted Lands.
