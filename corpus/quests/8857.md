Title: Secrets of the Colossus - Ashi
Description: I'm looking for battle hardened adventurers willing and able to get a fresh husk sample from the fallen Colossus of Ashi to Oglethorpe in Booty Bay. No, no, I wouldn't want you to go anywhere near that thing's corpse. Just take one of my samples and make it snappy. These things are no good to him rotten!
Objective: Take the Colossus of Ashi's Husk to Oglethorpe Obnoticus in Booty Bay.
