Title: Claws for Bloodfist Point
Description: Anyone could kill a stag, they are but deers with sharp horns! Hippogryph, on the other hand, is a different thing. Do you think you have what it takes? If so then bring me a handful of Thunderhead Claws. Thunderheads are local Hippogryphs, so wild and ferocious, that even the accursed Elves stay away from them, their claws would make great improvised weapons should things get rough.
Objective: Obtain 16 Thunderhead Claws.
