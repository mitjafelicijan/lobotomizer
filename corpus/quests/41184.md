Title: Right From Under My Green Nose
Description: I know, I know. His Excellency in his tower is thirsty and now his brother sends a poor, gullible ant up here to get the shipment he was promised. Heard that atleast three times today. You see, I would love to send Rustgate his water, the issue is just that his way of leading doesn't sit well with some of the moreâ€¦ idealistic and naive idiots on this island.$B$BThe caravan that was supposed to bring Rustgate his refreshing liquid was ambushed and looted by the denizens of the slums up there. Guess they not only want their own water, but also make sure that the Supreme Overseer stays as dry as a murloc in Tanaris.$B$BIf you want to help - and I hope to all that is golden you want to - then go up there and bring the shipment of water to Supplymaster Maxlo. If you succeed, tell him what's going on here.
Objective: Recover Rustgate's Water Shipment and bring it to Supplymaster Maxlo in Rustgate Ridge.
