The first place we should begin to look is Corin's Crossing, it is a place over-run by the scourge, and not somewhere I would travel!$B$BA book named 'The Secrets of Darkforging' may be the first step to uncovering what we seek, it is held by a Jacob Malwright. He was a rather famed smith in his days amongst the living and now walks among the dead. No doubt he still has it on him, or keeps it close by, kill him, bring me the book, let us begin to learn their tricks!
Objective: Travel to Corin's Crossing and recover The Secrets of Darkforging, bring it to Craftsman Wilhelm at Light's Hope Chapel.
