Title: Out of Options
Description: It would appear that I have run out of ideas about what may be causing this. I hate to admit intellectual defeat, but I must turn to another for an answer. Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver is well-versed in more than I know. I need you to travel to him with a crate of the ley-shards you gathered earlier.$B$BIf there is any clue or magic that lingers upon them, perhaps he will have some answers for them and know their origination to help me here in Azshara. Please, take these coins for the journey. Dalaran is but far away, and I will assist in whatever way I can.
Objective: Travel to Dalaran and deliver the Crate of Ley-shards to Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver.
