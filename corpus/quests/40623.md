Title: Troubling Winds
Description: It is a mistake to ignore nature. We, Gelkis, can learn a lot from a troubling breeze, a red sky, a lightning air.$B$BHmm. Recently the land has been scoured, even the rocks themselves, by roving air elementals. I cannot tell why they are so agitated! Ignoring their presence is a danger to us, and also ignoring omens of things to come.$B$BDisperse any that you see, $r, and bring me their cores. We may give these to our shamans, and we may learn from them. We will bolster our magic directly with the elements!
Objective: Slay the wayward elementals and bring 8 Airy Cores to Yesu'gei at Gelkis Village in Desolace.
