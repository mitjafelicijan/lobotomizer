Title: The Lies That Bind Us
Description: The magic that etched this belt came from Neeru Fireblade. I still cannot read the inscription, but with Neeru's hand in this, I can assure you that it is powerful. Go on your way now, $C. I don't need the wrath of Neeru or his minions targeting me.
Objective: Return to Gazlowe with Knobby's Belt.
