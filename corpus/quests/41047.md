The artifacts we have gathered are but a fragment of the greater plan to restore balance to the world.$B$BZalmos possessed a unique ability to regenerate with unparalleled potency.

We require the guidance of Cenerron. He was a druid who once studied under Zalmos. Though the passage of time has taken its toll on Cenerron, we believe he still roams the ancient forests of Feralas. His connection to the Wild God makes him the key to unlocking the potential of these artifacts.$B$BSearch for Cenerron amidst the wilderness of Feralas.
