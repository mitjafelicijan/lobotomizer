Title: Thieving Little Grell!
Description: Those little, thieving, coniving Grell, they pulled the snow over my eyes this year when I was least expecting it.$B$BThey stole my gift right out from beneath my nose. Though I will admit, I was a bit drunk, and awoke to find it missing, but that is here nor there.$B$BI have good suspicion that it is the Grell to the south west who are responsible. Trust me, this gift means a lot for me, and I really want to give it to someone special, do you think you could recover it from their camp for me?
Objective: Gather Carus' Gift from the Winter Grell Camp to the south west and return it to him in Winter Veil Vale.
