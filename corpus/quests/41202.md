Title: A Lesson In Bruisin'
Description: Hey there kid, I've been hearin' good things about you. Word around the streets of Rustgate is that you've learned to handle yourself. By handle yourself, I mean dish out a mean beating to anything that gets in your way. I like that, it's called moxy, and you seem -full- of it. I got a job for you, one to teach you all about our job as the real bruisers of the goblin workforce, you dig?$B$BTo the northeast the Mudpaw Gnolls have put up a real fight against our work here, and have even kicked us out of our worksites. Now this seems like a chance to test you against the meanest and most rabid of their kind. The Mudpaw Brutes are the strongest of their kin, and are often known for wielding those mighty hammers that they've been killing goblins with. Turn the tables on them, and give them a real beatin'. Bring me six Mudpaw Hammers, and I shall give you a reward. Not bad, huh?
Objective: Gather 6 Mudpaw Hammers from the Mudpaw Brutes to the northeast and return to Grizzie the Enforcer at Rustgate Ridge on Blackstone Island.
