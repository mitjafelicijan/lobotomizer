Title: Darlthos Heritage
Description: $R, I have a task for you. A rather important one.$B$B<Nargelas shows you a well-decorated jewelry box>.$B$BIn here lies the deed to the Tirisfal Uplands. You see, before the scourge invaded, my wife Grelda was supposed to inherit these lands from her father. On the coronation day, the contents of this box were supposed to pass on into her possession.$B$BMany moons have passed, and yet my courtiers and I had no luck in opening the lock on this thing. But during my research, a name came up. Vathras Millson. He specializes in these kinds of things. Head to Steepcliff Port and find him; I heard he owns an Inn now.$B$BOh, and do be careful. The box is worth more than your life.
Objective: Bring Darlthos' Jewelry Box to Vathras Millson in Steepcliff Port.
