Title: To Hunt The Hunter
Description: A decade ago, I was betrayed by a fellow Demon Hunter - one who shared my blood and broke bread with me. His name is Faladar Starsplinter, and he has returned to Felwood, bringing with him a corrupt presence that has tainted these already blighted lands.$B$BMy grievances with this traitor are many, but none are greater than his theft of a powerful artifact that bears my namesake: the Darkwind Star. This artifact has been passed down through generations of my family, and holds immense power within it. I demand its recovery from the hands of this cur, and I require your aid to obtain it.$B$BIf you wish to aid me in this task, you will find Faladar Starsplinter at the Shrine of the Betrayer. It is located northwest of Bloodvenom Falls and south of Irontree Woods. Your mission is to hunt him down and reclaim what is rightfully mine. Let the hunt begin.
Objective: Slay Faladar Starsplinter, and recover the Darkwind Star for Niremius Darkwind in Felwood.
