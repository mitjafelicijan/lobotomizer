Title: The Sanv Charm
Description: The world we come from is a hellish place. One filled with danger, with demons, and hostile to life in all ways imaginable. Food was scarce, and water even scarcer. I led my people to the safety of this world through our magic by way of the Rift. In the ancient days, my people created a charm that attuned them to the old world, and it held great magic. This allowed for Riftwalking, the ability to travel great distances.$B$BMuch of this skill is lost to us now. From stories told to me by the older generations, it was much more powerful than the primitive means we currently use.$B$BThe Sanv Charm, a powerful item, was lost on one of my trips to the Misty Valley. I have been attempting to communicate with a Riftseeker that was from the Harborage. As I was attempting communication in the valley, swampwalkers approached and attacked me. I was unable to gather the charm, so I left it in a small chest and fled for my life. Get it for me. It is of great importance.
Objective: Head to the Misty Valley and find the Sanv Charm.
