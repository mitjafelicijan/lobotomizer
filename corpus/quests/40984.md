Description: We have been charged with the duty to reactivate the Runestone of Cenarius. The magical energies that once ran through this stone were linked with the Runestone of Nordrassil, allowing transporation between here and Nordanaar.$B$BHowever, a foreign magic is interfering with this process. I require materials in order to ascertain what is exactly happening.$B$BFrom the Barkskin Furbolg gather five Barkskin Spirit Beads, from the Misthoof gather three of their antlers, and finally, I require a single Shimmering Ooze from the sludge like creatures that inhabit the region.
