I don't know very much about what they're doing, but did manage to discover that they're experimenting with something called a "samophlange".$b$bNow what the heck is a samophlange? Well, whatever it is, I want to examine it, so I need someone to go get it.$b$bI obtained a copy of their control system operating manual, you should be able to figure out how to disengage the samophlange from it.
Objective: Access the control console at the Venture Company research site.
