Title: Tome of the Cabal
Description: Well, ah, it's hard to let it go. But you found it, and you have more important things to do with it, of course. Just, please, be sure to mention to Strahad that I wanted a copy.$b$bWhile you were out, he sent a message for you. He wanted me to tell you that for his acolytes to assist with the summoning, you'll have to acquire three rods of channeling.$b$bHe might not know where to find them, but I do! They were last used by the orcs of the Dragonmaw clan in the Wetlands. I'd check their spellcasters!
