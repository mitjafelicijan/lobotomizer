Title: The Stolen Notes
Description: Allow me a moment to collect myself.$B$B<The druid pauses, struggling to focus, his injuries clearly affecting him.>$B$BPay no heed to my wounds, they will heal in time. Listen closely. The furbolgs who attacked me not only caused me harm, but also stole my precious notes. I must retrieve them, but my condition prevents me from doing so at the moment. It is imperative that Yohan remains unaware of what has transpired here. Do you understand? Do not reveal to him that I have lost my notes.$B$BSearch for the furbolgs who carried out this attack. I have seen them fleeing towards the east, and may still be encamped in the area. Once you recover my notes, deliver them to Yohan without delay. I must insist that you do not read them, as they contain knowledge that is reserved only for our order.$B$BIf Yohan inquires about me, inform him that I will return soon, but I still have some research to finish. I trust in your discretion.
Objective: Return Marlonias' Notes to Yohan Wildwalker.
