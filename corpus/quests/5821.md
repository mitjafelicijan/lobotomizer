It's not good for business to be dead!$B$BI'll tell you what $c, if you protect us past the Kolkar village we'll make it worth your while.$B$BIt's just a short distance, all you need to do is keep the caravan intact and you can pick up your reward from Smeed Scrabblescrew - he is down the road a bit. We do a little business together.
