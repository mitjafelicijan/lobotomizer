Title: Through Greater Magic
Description: The wretched Greymane forces, perpetrators of my demise and desecrators of my church. Why did they target me?$B$BThe answer remains an enigma, yet I sense it is intertwined with the significance of this place. Centuries ago, a battle unfolded upon this very hill, where the forces of Gilneas, against all odds, triumphed over Arathor. I am convinced that the key to their triumph lay buried within these grounds, and the Regent's bloodlust coveted this dormant power for their own malevolent purposes.$B$BWe must delve deep into this mystery. Unearthing such power would bestow upon us a formidable advantage. I shall sift through these weathered tomes, unearthing knowledge that may shed light on our quarry.$B$BIn the interim, I ask you to embark on a perilous journey to Desolace. There, amidst the demons, seek out and retrieve the Eye of Xythosâ€”an artifact rumored to possess the ability to uncover the secrets of the past, if one can channel the energies of the Forgotten Shadow, of course.
Objective: Find the Eye of Xythos in Desolace, then return to Dark Bishop Mordren at Stillward Church in Gilneas.
