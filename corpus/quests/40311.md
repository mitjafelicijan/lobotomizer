Title: The Mystery of Karazhan I
Description: I have ventured to this rather decrepid, and lonely place to investigate the mysteries surrounding Karazhan. It has long since loomed over this land with a great power emitting from it. While the tower is impressive, it does not boast the power it once held under the rule of Medivh.$B$BMy analysis of the tower is that the growing power does not come from above, but below. There have always been tales of a crypt that stretched deep beneath Karazhan, perhaps they may be true.$B$BThe first thing I ask of you is to search for a long lost pendant, rumored to have been taken from the ruins of Karazhan some time ago. It will be needed to magically attune the key for our purposes. My suspicion is that the ogre's of the region have taken hold of it. An ogre magi by the name of Var'zhog has grown to some renown as of recently, no doubt he holds the pendant.
Objective: Search for the Pendant of Ardan, rumored to be held by the ogre Var'zhog, collect it, and return to Magus Ariden Dusktower in Deadwind Pass.
