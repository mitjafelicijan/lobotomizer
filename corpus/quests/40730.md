Title: Early Testing
Description: Those bananas from the island were warped, not like the Ripe Tel'abim Bananas on the island here, but something deformed.$B$BIt seems we must turn to a different solution, but I am running out of ideas all cooped up in this Shack alone.$B$BWhy don't we try something, obvious. What if you procured an Elixir of Giant Growth, and we just, simply poured it over the banana, its worth a shot, right?
Objective: Gather an Elixir of Giant Growth for Tazzo Gearfire at Tazzo's Shack in Tel'abim.
