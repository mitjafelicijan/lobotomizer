Title: The Tower of Althalaxx
Description: I see. Well, if what you say is true, then now is the time to strike. I believe Athrikus resides at the top of the tower. Be careful though, he is surrounded by many powerful warlocks, much more deadly than the ones you faced before.
Objective: Kill Athrikus Narassin and bring his head to Balthule Shadowstrike near the Tower of Althalaxx.
