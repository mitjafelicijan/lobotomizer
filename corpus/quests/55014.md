Title: The Ethereal Project
Description: Me and Frix had spent quite a bit of our time researching power sources out here in Azshara. and there is some stuff that seemed to pose quite lucrative ventures.$B$BTo the south-west is more ruins, haunted and seemingly guarded by the passed ghosts of Highborne.$B$BI believe these spirits could very well be used as a source of power. You see, their essence is extremely potent. The only problem is, well, to get it from them.$B$BHead there and gather me the ghosts' essences, and don't worry about being moral, they'll pass on to whatever fate awaits them!$B$B<Gazztoggle smirks to himself.>
