Title: The Upper Binding I
Description: Many long years ago, I came in contact with a powerful artifact that drew immense powers from the ley-lines across azeroth. I intended to study this artifact but its powers slowly drained through the years. What research I was able to conduct was rather disappointing, and now I am left with a rather exquisite paper-weight.$B$BIf you assist me in restoring this old relic to its former power, perhaps you may have more luck with it than I did. The first thing that I require is a Dragonkin Charge, which holds great draconic magic. I have heard that dragonkin from Blackrock Spire are known to possess such items.
Objective: Gather a Dragonkin Charge from the Black Dragonkin within Blackrock Spire for Parnabus in Gilneas.
