Title: Lack of Surplus
Description: With the threat of murlocs along the coast, we're stationed out here to protect--or warn if the force is too large--of any coming threats to Stonard. It doesn't give us much time for relaxation, and we could use some more help if you're able.$B$BThe sawtooth snappers' claws make for fine weapons when properly prepared. Bring me some of their claws and I'll see you're rewarded with one of our weapons in thanks for the fresh meat and the good company.
Objective: Bring 6 Sawtooth Snapper Claws to Tok'Kar in the Swamp of Sorrows.
