Title: Help A Gnome Out
Description: Hey, $r, down here! If you have some spare time, I could really use your help.$B$BYou see, there's this kodo in Un'goro Crater, their name is Dadanga. I've heard that they give you a gift if you feed them bloodpetals. It sounds like this gift would have a nice surprise in it, and I love surprises!$B$BAnyways, these sprouts are found all over the crater, and I'd love to get my hands on some. Bring me 30 bloodpetals and I'll pay you. I'll even give you something I cooked from one of my original recipes!
Objective: You're pretty sure Reas wants you to bring 30 bloodpetal sprouts to her in Gadgetzan.
