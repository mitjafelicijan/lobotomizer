Title: The Secret Recipe
Description: I have taken the time to study the parchment, and have discovered that it is a half complete copy of 'Le Fishe Au Chocolat'. One of Medivh's more favored dishes, and one that takes considerable skill to complete. If you desire to learn what secrets this recipe holds, I suggest you speak to 'The Cook' here in Karazhan.
Objective: Speak with 'The Cook' in Karazhan.
