Title: Paint the Roses Red
Description: It's about time someone with some skills showed up around here! It's one thing to send fresh bodies after the lower Scarlet ranks, but I need an experienced $C if we're going to bring down the zealots on their own grounds.$B$BHmm. I seem to recall you being quite the efficient killer. Let me see that you've still got what it takes to serve. Thin the ranks outside the Monastery!
Objective: Eliminate the Scarlet forces outside the Scarlet Monastery, then return to Deathguard Burgess in Brill.
