Title: The Horn of Garek'sa
Description: I was once the master hunter of the tribe long ago. I stalked the paths of Outland with efficiency and defeated many fearsome foes. Both orc and beast alike were slain by my swift arrows and deadly proficiency.$B$BBut, I am no longer Har Na'lan the great hunter, I am Har Na'lan the old. I can feel age slowing me down, and even the local wildlife has been a challenge.$B$BOver six hundred years ago, I slew my most fearsome foe, a mighty Ravager by the name of Garek'sa. The Ravagers were mostly extinct with the coming demons and through age. But Garek'sa lived on as a mighty, and fearsome foe, as large as the biggest of our huts. With two quick arrows to its neck and a slash to its abdomen, I slew the creature and took its horn as a trophy.$B$BIt is a shame to say, when we left the Fallow Sanctuary to the east, I had no time to gather my possessions, and my horn was left behind. Get it for me, please and I shall reward you greatly.
Objective: Find the Horn of Garek'sa for Har Na'lan at the Fallow Sanctuary.
