Title: Threat From the Sea
Description: I have no love for the sea, nor any creature I've seen come from its depths. It is a powerful but blind mistress; callous and brutal. It would bring me great pleasure to slay the fish men by the hundreds if it were within my power. But I garner some pleasure from watching their deaths at the hands of any who do the Horde's will.$B$BWhich brings us to you, $c. How many can you slay? Would you test yourself against their most powerful kind?
Objective: Kill 10 Marsh Murlocs, 10 Marsh Inkspewer, and 10 Marsh Flesheater, then return to Katar in the Swamp of Sorrows.
