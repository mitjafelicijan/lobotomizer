Title: Controlling Sailors
Description: The life of a Petty Officer is much akin to herding sheep. I am in charge of keeping my men in control, and while that is easy on a ship, when docked in Stormwind it can be -very- difficult to have my attention on all of them at once.$B$BThey are spread around the city, sight-seeing, and no doubt getting quite drunk.$B$BI could use a favor, if you don't mind. There are three sailors that I know of in the city, Hylreth, Brewen, and Pardol. Find them, and find out what exactly it is they are up to, just make sure they are not in any trouble is all, for my sake.
Objective: Find, and speak with the Kul Tiran Sailors sight-seeing Stormwind City to make sure they are not up to any shenanigans. Once spoken with, return to Petty Officer Milldough at the Kul Tiran Embassy in Stormwind Harbor.
