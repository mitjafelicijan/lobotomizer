Title: Relics in Feralas
Description: Well well... So far you've proven useful so perhaps I can give you a more important task than fetching crystals.$B$BMy people descend from the Highborne, we were once the pinnacle of Kaldorei society, ruling a great empireâ€¦ While few traces remain of that here in the Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor is filled to the brim with ruins, ruins that have not been looted!$B$BI need you to travel to the jungle of Feralas, once home to the city state of Eldre'thalas. In the area just south of Eldre'thalas there should be some ruins...$B$BI believe the locals call it the High Wilderness. Our scouts have reported that the Ogres holding the ruins have inadvertently dug up some valuable Arcane artifacts. I want you to go down there and get me those artifacts...$B$BBefore those big oafs crush them with their feet! Now get going, quickly!
Objective: Gather 4 Arcane Artifacts from the High Wilderness in Feralas.
