Title: Unusual Partnership
Description: There you are, $N! I know it took quite a while, but we finally have new information on the missing plates of Uldum.$B$BWell, when I say that we “have” something, I mean we found someone who might be able to get it for us. She is a smuggler named Vess, at least I think that's what she calls herself these days. Anyways, I have arranged for you to meet her at the Booty Bay inn.$B$BOnce you get there, make sure to get on her good side, as I doubt we will get another chance like this.
Objective: High Explorer Magellas wants you to locate his contact Vess in the Booty Bay Inn.
