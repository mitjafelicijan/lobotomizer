Title: The Flame's Casing
Description: We need one final piece to form the torch.$B$BIn the mountains to the northwest you will find a large encampment of Twilight's Hammer. It is rumored that they carry symbols and idols that pay homage to their god. These symbols and idols could carry sufficient enchantment to form a magical casing. Bring me a single symbol of Ragnaros and I will try to extract the magic from the item to create the casing.
Objective: Find and return a Symbol of Ragnaros to Kalaran Windblade.
