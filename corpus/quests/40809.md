Title: The Final Strike
Description: The enemies are reeling, their compatriots' blood in their eyes and their death-rattles in their ears. Do not let up the pressure now, $c. Seek the brutish Commander Grushak south of the keep, possibly watching from one of their towers. He should be separated from the bulk of the forces. And find the venomous Farseer Grimeye in the keep, plotting away his next move.$B$BI will leave it to you, if you grant them a warrior's swift death, or a slow and painful one. As long as they are dead and gone, Elune will smile upon whichever choice you make.
Objective: Slay Commander Grushak and Farseer Grimeye for Commander Starwind at Forest Song in Ashenvale.
