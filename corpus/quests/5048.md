Title: Good Natured Emma
Description: She's a tad ornery, and quite possibly out of her gourd... but the records indicate that Ol' Emma does fit the framework of who Emma Felstone might be.$B$BPerhaps you've seen Ol' Emma wander the city - she talks to herself, most often in nonsensical jibber-jabber.Still, she doesn't hurt anything or anyone, so folks pretty much leave her be.$B$BAll things considered, I would say that Ol' Emma is in fact Emma Felstone.You might try asking if her last name is indeed Felstone.
Objective: Find Ol' Emma in Stormwind and see if she is in fact Emma Felstone.If she is, then perhaps she'd like the package Janice Felstone made for her.
