Title: Coldtooth Supplies
Description: The Coldtooth mine to the north was once an ideal place to store extra supplies, but now that the fighting with the Stormpikes grows fierce, we do not always have the spare warriors to station at the mine and protect it.And so, control of the mine often falls to the Alliance, or to underground denizens...$B$BBut we still need our supplies, $N!Go to the Coldtooth mine and bring me a load of them.And be wary of enemies as you go; the tides of battle shift quickly in that place...
Objective: Bring 10 Coldtooth Supplies to the Horde Quatermaster in Frostwolf Keep.
