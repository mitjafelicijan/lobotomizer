Title: Roasted Tauren
Description: I'm so hungry, I could eat a whole cow. Sadly there are no cows in Alterac Valley. But some scouts spotted something even bigger recently.Delicious beefy taurens were seen running wild among the orcs in the south. If you catch one of those, we could feed the whole tribe!You must go hunting as soon as possible, before the taurens have migrated away.
Objective: Use the rope to capture a live tauren and bring it to the Winterax Cook.
