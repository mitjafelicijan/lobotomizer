I thought surely they would kill us right there and then, but it became obvious they had other plans.$B$BTyranis attempted to speak to them. I think he wanted to impress them with his knowledge of the arcane... I'm not sure why.$B$BPlease, I can't leave here until I know what's happened to my brother. Find him, then come back for me when his fate is known.
