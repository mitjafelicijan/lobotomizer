Title: To Catch a Rat...
Description: If we truly want to unravel the truth of this ploy, we will have to spur the Scarlets to play their cards into our hands.$B$BFor this purpose, I have pressed a Deathguard into your service. His name is Maverin, or Moverish â€” human names are a blight to my tongue.$B$BYou will find him in the graveyard near the path to the Monastery in the north. Have him play the bait, he is not a valuable asset, then slay the Scarlets and seize whatever you can find of this curious new weapon in their arsenal.$B$BDo not disappoint me.
Objective: Find Deathguard Maverick and set a trap for the Scarlet Crusade. Report back to Varimathras.
