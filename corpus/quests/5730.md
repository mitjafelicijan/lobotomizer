Title: Hidden Enemies
Description: You are one of my lieutenants! Prepare yourself, $c. I will call upon you soon.$B$BMy time spent on the Searing Blade may be all but wasted now, but that does not mean that the Shadow Council's schemes elsewhere must suffer. I will do what I can to minimize the damage here in Ragefire Chasm. In the meantime, I will have my agents in the Barrens and Ashenvale begin work on our newest agenda. Return to me soon.
Objective: Speak to Thrall in Orgrimmar and tell him what you've learned.
