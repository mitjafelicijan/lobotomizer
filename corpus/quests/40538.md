Title: Peculiar Won't Even Cut It
Description: One of our scouting parties took this worg with them. They had to face some whelps, and they claim that some of those are as hard as the very metal we shape and forge. I would never mistrust my clan, $N. But I will not endanger the scouting party either, they are not cut for this kind of work. I can't even send this worg with you, it is wounded and seems too afraid to return, it must be reshaped.$B$BI urge you to go and find these peculiar dragonlings and bring an end to them. My clansmen say they can be found to the east of the Steppes, where the dark irons that assumed the name of Hateforge have been roaming.$B$BKill them and find out what kind of trickery these dwarves have been up to.
Objective: Slay 8 Peculiar Dragonlings for Worg Mistress Katalla in Karfang Hold.
