Title: Strange Sources
Description: To tell you the truth, although there are no volcanoes here in Winterspring, I believe that there are far more threatening reasons for these hot springs...$B$BWell, I think you'll want to see it for yourself. You'll need to travel the length of Winterspring, and head to the very south. When the air becomes thick and muggy, and the sky turns dark, you'll have found what I believe to be the source of the hot springs.$B$BHave a look. I'm sure you'll have many questions when you return.
Objective: Follow Donova Snowden's instructions, then report back.
