Title: The Backup Seal-Valve
Description: Blasted valve! Each and every day we are having more leaks from the main water pump. If Tel Co. Basecamp is to last, it needs a supply of fresh water, regardless of what Telraz or Nokrot say.$B$BMany of our backup parts were located far to the north of the island at Bixxle's Storehouse, but there's been -very- little traffic between us and them since, well, everything fell apart.$B$BI need you to head there. Just follow the road all the way north, and rummage around for the 'Backup Seal-Valve'. Bixxle should have plenty, just look around for a crate labeled with the name, and return it to me. Simple yeah?
Objective: Travel to Bixxle's Storehouse in Northern Tel'abim and collect the Backup Seal-Valve for Pumpworker Zalwan at Tel Co. Basecamp.
