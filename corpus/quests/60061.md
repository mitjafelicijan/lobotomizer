Title: You Reap What You Sow
Description: Ish-ne-alo por-ah, young one! Sole reason you're here can only be the desire to learn how to foster your own garden and procure food where otherwise it wouldn't grow I believe? By the squint in your eyes I can see it is true. Very well.$B$BThere's a particular type of seeds you will have to find first. Once you have'em all with you I shall teach you something not even hunters or trappers would know how to survive with less violence and killing. This is the Blessing that our tribes bear with pride and foster with care, a Blessing of the Earth-Mother herself. Come back to me when you have all the seeds I've mentioned in this parchment here. I have and will be expecting you â€¦ again.$B$BWinds be at your back.
Objective: Find Country Pumpkin Seeds, Mountain Berries Seeds, Striped Melon Seeds and Magic Mushrooms Samples!
