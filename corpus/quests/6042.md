Title: Un-Life's Little Annoyances
Description: You cannot take two steps off of this farm without running into one of those obnoxious bats. I want to be able to take the hounds out and slaughter Scourge without being accosted by any damned, dirty bats. Obviously, I have better things to do with my time than mindlessly kill bats day in and day out. You, however, do not.$B$BWhat? Your training? This is your training! Now get out of my sight and don't come back until you've killed a fair number of those winged demons. Don't disappoint me.
Objective: Slay 20 Noxious Plaguebats and 10 Monstrous Plaguebats. Return to Nathanos Blightcaller when you are finished.
