Title: More Wastewander Justice
Description: We need you to take on the stronger ranks of the Wastewander nomads now.You've done a good job thus far, but if we are to take back those water wells, then it only makes sense to do it against as few nomads as possible!$B$BThis time around we need you to take down their rogues, assassins, and shadow mages.You'll find them east and southeast of here.$B$BI'm not going to lie to you - they're a nasty lot.Do this for us though, and we'll be on our way to taking back what is rightfully ours!
Objective: Take down 10 Wastewander Shadow Mages, 8 Wastewander Rogues, and 6 Wastewander Assassins for Chief Engineer Bilgewhizzle in Gadgetzan.
