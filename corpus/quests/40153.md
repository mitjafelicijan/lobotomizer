Title: An Extravagant Book
Description: <The barrel appears to still be held together quite well and looks to be sturdy. Upon searching further, you find an extravagant book. It is certainly old but still has a golden thread on the spine. It has the label 'Great Virtue - Father Ben' written upon the front. Perhaps this belongs to someone.>
Objective: Find the owner of the book.
