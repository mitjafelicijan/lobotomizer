Title: Ending Blacksand
Description: For too long have we druids been merciful towards our enemy, The Venture Company.$B$BThey care nothing for the world around them, stubbornly working towards their goals for their own greed. If we are ever to put an end to their callous destruction of the land, then we must match their brutality.$B$BThere is too much at stake for us to stand idle, and so I ask that you slay the workers at the Blacksand Oil Fields. Collect their Blacksand Badges as proof of your deeds, cutting down as many of their numbers as you can.$B$BYou can find this misbegotten place northwest of the Charred Vale, through a passageway they've cut into the mountains.$B$BGo there and put an end to this madness.
Objective: Gather 18 Blacksand Badges from Venture Co. at Blacksand Oil Fields for Silmaron at Stonetalon Peak in Stonetalon Mountains.
