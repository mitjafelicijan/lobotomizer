Title: The Lost Pages
Description: I just picked up this shredder from Ratchet and I was on my way back to the Warsong Lumber Camp, where I am supposed to be on duty. I was given a manual on how to operate the shredder, but on the trip back, a huge gust of wind blew it from my hands. The pages went everywhere, and all I was left with was the cover.$B$BThe pages could be just about anywhere by now, I suppose... but I don't know how to use the shredder without them! Will you find them for me?
Objective: Find the 12 missing pages of the Shredder Operating Manual, and put them together to form Chapters 1, 2, and 3. Return the pages to Gurda Ragescar near Splintertree Post.
