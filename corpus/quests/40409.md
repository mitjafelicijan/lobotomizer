Title: The Mirefin Nuisance
Description: I've lived at this lighthouse for a long time now, and if there is anything that has bothered me most it's those damned Mirefin. They often venture deep out within the ocean and upon the shorelines to the north, but as of recently they have come down here if only to drive me mad and steal my things!$B$BThe Theramore Guard cannot have someone staying here full time, especially with us being seperated by a boat ride.$B$BI ask of you to rid me of their annoyance, and for good. I feel like its only a matter of time before they do something more serious. You can find them all along the coast up to the north and on small little islands. Bring me twenty of their claws and thin out their numbers so they think twice before coming so far south.
Objective: Collect 20 Mirefin Claws for Old Bryan at the Theramore Lighthouse.
