Title: Sigil of Trollbane
Description: The final of the sigils needed to unlock the tomb of Thoras Trollbane is held by his son personally. He resides deep within Stromgarde, in a chapel in the militia-held districts. Prince Galen is well protected and no slouch of a warrior himself, so this task could prove most difficult.
Objective: Kill Prince Galen Trollbane and bring the Sigil of Trollbane to Zengu in Hammerfall.
