Title: Commander Gor'shak
Description: Poor Gargal... didn't even see it coming. WHAM! The arrow landed dead center on the top of his head. He was no genius before but now...$B$B<Galamav grimaces.>$B$BWhen we dislodged the arrow, we noticed a rolled up note attached to the shaft. On the note was a crudely drawn picture of an orc behind bars with the signature of Commander Gor'shak attached.$B$BIf he's still alive in the Depths, you'll have to find him.$B$BA trap you say? Well no kidding, numb hooves! That's why you're going!
Objective: Find Commander Gor'shak in Blackrock Depths.$B$BYou recall that the crudely drawn picture of the orc included bars drawn over the portrait. Perhaps you should search for a prison of some sort.
