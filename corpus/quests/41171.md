Title: Searching Wreckage
Description: You're familiar with diving wreckages, I heard? Oh, you're surprised? Nothing escapes my ears, bugger, so don't think of doing something fishy around here. I'll have a bruiser on your back sooner than you can say â€˜gold coin'.$B$BAnother ship wrecked on the east coast, no pirate vessel, but one from Sparkwater Port itself. Numerous crates and new workers on it. We already salvaged most of the useful supplies, but weren't lucky to find its logbook. What? Yes, some of the goblins on ship were also lost, but if you ask me, if they can't survive a simple wreckage, then Blackstone ain't the place for them.$B$BGet me that logbook, and beware of the murlocs around there. I don't want to lose any more workforce in retrieving this damn thing.
Objective: Recover the Venture Co. Logbook and bring it to Taxxlo Rustgate.
