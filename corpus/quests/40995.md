Title: The Powers Beyond
Description: To harness the true potential of this fractured weapon, we must not shy away from embracing the power it holds. However, caution must prevail, for in its current state of disrepair, wielding it would be a grave folly. To mend the cracks that mar its surface and restore its formidable strength, I require a potent artifact crafted from dark obsidian.$B$BFortuitously, I have knowledge of a likely source for such an object. Venture westward, to the Barrens of Kalimdor, where Razorfen Downs stands as a bastion of darkness. Within its depths, a malevolent lich has established his abode, guarded by undead minions and ensconced in nefarious sorcery.$B$BIt is said that his phylactery, the vessel of his immortal essence, is forged from the very obsidian we seek.
Objective: Venture into Razorfen Downs, slay Amnennar the Coldbringer and retrieve his phylactery for Dark Bishop Mordren at Stillward Church in Gilneas.
