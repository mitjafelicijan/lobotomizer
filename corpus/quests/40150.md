Title: Drowning Deeptide
Description: The Naga of the Deeptide have been a problem ever since we first arrived. They attacked our vessels when we first landed upon the island of Gillijim with the High Elves we came with. While we were victorious, it still was reason enough for us to travel to Lapidis instead.$B$BUnfortunately, you know what happened after we got here, but still, the naga remain a threat that must be dealt with. They have a sanctum off the southwestern coast of Gillijim's Island located just south of Lapidis.$B$BHead to their sanctum, and kill what naga you find. Take from them their bracelets and bring them to me.
Objective: Collect 10 Deeptide Bracelets from Deeptide Naga for Eliza Caldwell in Caelan's Rest.
