Title: Arugal's Folly
Description: It will indeed take me longer than I had thought to uncover the dark secrets behind the enchantments Arugal was using.$b$bBut in the meantime I need you to take care of a slight problem our Darkstalkers have discovered.It seems that Arugal let his magic spread to the Deep Elem Mine in the hills to the southeast.$b$bThe mine would prove to be quite a resource for Varimathras's advance.$b$bI want you to behead the tainted foreman of the mine, Grimson the Pale.With his death, the mine shall be ours.
Objective: Kill Grimson the Pale and bring his head to Dalar Dawnweaver at the Sepulcher.
