Description: Glad you're back, $N. You know I love me some gossip, and I bet you do, too. Maybe you'd care to shed a little light on why your name is on the lips of such bad news?$B$BI hear you owe Leyti Quicktongue some money. Did you gamble all of your savings back home or what?$B$BIs she your loan shark? Do I have to pay for your health insurance? That's not gonna happen, pal.$B$BLook, just take this letter she left for you. I don't want to hold this thing anymore, especially with that nasty looking green stuff dripping off the corner. Probably acid or poison or something.$B$BShort break, and I mean short!
Objective: Read the Ooze-covered Letter and speak to Leyti Quicktongue.
