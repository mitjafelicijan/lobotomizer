Title: Winterfall Ritual Totem
Description: You have found one of the Winterfall furbolg's ritual totems.The totem itself is of non-descript construction, but it seems to emanate an almost tangible sense of dread and despair.If many of the Winterfall furbolgs do indeed carry these, it certainly would go a long way in explaining their current condition.$B$BOne of the furbolgs inside Timbermaw Hold may have a use for such an item... that is, if you've earned their trust enough for them to speak with you.
Objective: Take the Winterfall Ritual Totem inside Timbermaw Hold and see if one of the furbolgs there will find a use for the item.The Timbermaw will not speak with you unless you are of Neutral reputation or greater with them.
