Title: Horde Presence
Description: This scroll is from that scheming dryad Rynthariel, Keymaster of the Talon Den on Stonetalon Peak.$B$BShe'll not be making any more contact with the messenger you looted this from, heh, but we must stand our ground here. The Horde will not tolerate her outrunners here.$B$B$N, travel to the Talon Den. Kill Rynthariel, and then put up a symbol for all to see. Take this Horde flag, $N. Put it up in the Talon Den so that they will not be so rash as to send another messenger through our territory again.
Objective: Kill the leader of the Talon Den, Rynthariel the Keymaster.
