Title: The Missing Diplomat
Description: Whoa, this looks way too complex to be something to just lead you astray. I shouldn't even be looking at this stuff. Take it to Trias--he'll be able to make sense of it. And DON'T let anyone get in your way. This is bigger than me. It might even be bigger than him, but we'll see.$B$BAnd do me a favor, $N, don't tell anyone I helped you. If my superiors found out I knew about any of this and didn't share it with them they'd probably hang me.
Objective: Bring the Defias Docket to Elling Trias in Stormwind.
