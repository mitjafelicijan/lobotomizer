Title: The Turbocharged Wobble-free Fizz Disk
Description: Now that Gigno has vouched for you, I'd like to get some real work done around here! The Turbocharged Wobble-free Fizz Disk is an invention that I made. It assisted us in reading magic and ley levels within Azshara. We had a good thing going for a while until all of the naga and the murlocs showed up months ago!$B$BThey drove us away from our site, and I had to abandon the Fizz Disk, or I would have most certainly lost my life prying it free from their grasp. I want you to get it back to continue my work and not have to start all over. The Fizz Disk was something I was cooking up back in Gnomeregan, and many of my plans are still left behind there.$B$BTo the east is where the Rethress Naga have taken sanctuary. If you head north of the Sanctum, there is a somewhat maze-like canyon. Within that canyon, there's a cave. You'll find a control panel inside of that cave. Search the inside of the control panel for the Turbocharged Wobble-free Fizz Disk.
Objective: Retrieve the Turbocharged Wobble-free Fizz Disk for Fendo Wobblefizz at Flaxwhisker Front.
