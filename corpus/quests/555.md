Title: Soothing Turtle Bisque
Description: If there's one thing you'll learn about Southshore it's that we have some of the best cuisine north of Stormwind!$b$bTake my secret recipe for Turtle Bisque, for example. I've known folks to travel from as far as Darkshire just to enjoy a bowl.Speaking of which, I haven't been able to make any lately.I used to head up past Dalaran to Lake Lordamere myself to hunt Snapjaws but it's just too dangerous now. If you bring me some Turtle Meat from the Snapjaws up north and Soothing Spices, I'll whip some up!
Objective: Bring 10 pieces of Turtle Meat and some Soothing Spices to Chef Jessen in Southshore.
