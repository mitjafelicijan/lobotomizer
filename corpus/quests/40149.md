Title: The Rotten Renown
Description: <The chest appears to be covered in muck and incredibly damaged by the salty seawater. Inside, a few small items and a rather heavy book look well kept and quite elegant. Upon further inspection, it is obvious that this is the logbook of the pirate ship, 'Rotten Renown', and holds information that may be of use to someone.>
Objective: Find someone who can find a use for the Logbook of the Rotten Renown.
