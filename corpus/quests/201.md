Title: Investigate the Camp
Description: I've gotten reports of a group of hunters that have set up camp upriver of the Venture Company mining camp on Lake Nazferiti. Now, normally I wouldn't care, but improbably, I heard that Hemet Nesingwary was one of the hunters there? He's certainly well-connected, if you catch my meaning, and you never can be too safe.$b$bWhy don't you go check out the camp, $n, see what they're about?
Objective: Find the hunters' camp and report its location to Krazek in Booty Bay.
