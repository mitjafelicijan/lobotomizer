Title: The Legend Comes To Life!
Description: Alright! Now that you've heard the stories, it is time to search for them. There is a good chance that there is some truth to the legends. I've got plenty of ale, my writing quill and plenty of time. Go out into the wilds of Kalimdor and see what you can find! You'll be looking for the Winter Patriarch of the Tauren, the Ancient of Winter of the Night elves, and last but not least, Father Bear of the Furbolg.
Objective: Find the Winter Patriach of the Tauren, the Ancient of Winter of the Night Elves and the Father Bear of the Furbolg, once complete, return to Mulin Snowbeard in Winter Veil Vale.
