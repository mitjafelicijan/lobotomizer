Title: The Deeds of Sir Danuvis
Description: It has been a long and exhausting journey. I have fought many battles, and vanquished many foes.$B$BBefore I left my home, I yearned to behold the Cathedral of Light following its restoration. Instead, I was told I would be sent here, rather than to the Embassy in Stormwind. I will not lie to say it hurt me, for I fear I may not see it at the end of all this.$B$BI would still like to pay homage to the Cathedral, however, and I ask you, friend, to do it for me.$B$BBring this tome containing all of my deeds to the Cathedral of Stormwind, and let it be recorded, lest I fall unremembered on this forsaken edge of the world.
Objective: Bring The Deeds of Sir Danuvis to the Cathedral of Light in Stormwind.
