Title: Down in the Ridge
Description: Hold, $N. I've one more piece of intel for you if you're heading into the Echo Ridge Mine. One of my scouts spoke of a kobold much larger than the rest hiding deep within the heart of the mine.$B$BIts size suggests it may be coordinating the other kobolds, which makes its mere existence a great threat to Northshire. Slay it, and we may very well deal a decisive blow to the kobold infestation.$B$BI want you to go down into the Echo Ridge Mine and kill the foul creature. Your efforts will be rewarded appropriately.
Objective: Kill Snufflesnout, then report back to Marshal McBride in Northshire Abbey.
