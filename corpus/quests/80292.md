Title: A Lone Homecoming
Description: Don't worry about me. I will not be alone here. I have my... guards with me. And you must agree that this place is too important to leave unattended.$B$BOh, and if you could avoid mentioning the stuff about hearing voices, that would be wonderful. I don't want to scare the potential helpers, which Anu'delen might send my way.
Objective: Return to Anu'delen in Alah'Thalas.
