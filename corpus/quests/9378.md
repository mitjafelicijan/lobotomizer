Title: DND FLAG The Dread Citadel - Naxxramas
Description: In the thick of Plaguewood lies the entrance to the dread citadel of Naxxramas. Previously, all attempts to enter had been stymied by the magical wards placed upon the rune portal. That is, until now.$B$BWe have devised a way to gain entry via a permanent arcane cloaking of sorts - an old cantrip of the Kirin Tor with a few modifications of my own. With that said, the cloaking is costly; however, your dedication to the cause of the Dawn is unwavering! We will waive all cost associations.
Objective: Archmage Angela Dosantos at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands will grant you Arcane Cloaking at no cost. You must be Exalted with the Argent Dawn.
