Title: One Draenei's Junk...
Description: Well, after that display of voracious greed, I feel nauseous.$B$BRegardless, I shall not dwell too long on your material addiction.$B$BFor each imperfect draenethyst fragment you turn in, I shall reward you with more junk. My junk heap gets smaller while your junk heap gets larger. On Draenor we call this a 'win-win' situation.
Objective: Bring Kum'isha Imperfect Draenethyst Fragments. Any form of monster in the Blasted Lands could be carrying a fragment.
