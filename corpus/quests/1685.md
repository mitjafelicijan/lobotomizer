Was looking for you all day and couldn't find you, now when I'm not expecting it, you come and walk right up to me.$b$bI've wasted enough time trying to find you, so I won't delay you any longer. Master Gakin's summoned you for additional training. Seems to me you should seek him out as soon as possible.$b$bYou'll find him in the basement of the Slaughtered Lamb tavern. By the way, you might want to keep that particular location quiet. Don't want word spreading about it.
