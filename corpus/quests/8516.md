Title: The Alliance Needs More Thick Leather!
Description: Yep, the stack's still not high enough. $N, we still haven't reached our goal of $2071w thick leather. Just think of all the things that we can make with all of that leather! All kinds of armor and weapons. Stuff for inside the steam tanks and rifle scopes! Engineering goggles, and I bet if it ends up that we collect too much we could give the rest to the Horde for their zeppelins!$B$BYou gonna bring me back some more thick leather?
Objective: Bring 10 thick leather to Marta Finespindle at the airfield in Dun Morogh.
