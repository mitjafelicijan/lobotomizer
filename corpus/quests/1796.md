Title: Components for the Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe
Description: The first item I will aid you in creating is a robe. You will gather the items for me, and we will put them together. Afterwards, assuming you succeed, you will have the first of many items that will make you more powerful and aid you in your struggles.$B$BTo start, you must have crafted Robes of Arcana. A tailor can make this for you, or perhaps you can purchase one from someone else--I'd be most impressed if you could make it yourself--but regardless, bring me the robes, and we shall go from there.
Objective: Bring Robes of the Arcana to Menara Voidrender in the Barrens.
