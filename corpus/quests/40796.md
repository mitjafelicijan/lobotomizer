Title: Hidden but not Gone
Description: There are many things that can hurt me. After seeing so many years pass by, believe me when I say, physical pain is among the least of them.$B$BI assume you are not unfamiliar with the problems we have in Ashenvale, $c? Between the Horde and the Sayaads, the tranquillity of the forest is fast becoming just a memory. But we have persisted - and will persist - through this challenge and countless more, mark my words.$B$BThe disgusting demons that have an uncanny resemblance to us are the worst affronts to nature. They hide away in their hovels, plotting corruption and torturing us all. I want you to head to each one of their nooks and crannies, and do your fair share in thinning them out. Bring me a collection of their gnarled and twisted horns, and the Kaldorei will know of your bravery.
Objective: Collect 6 horns from each of the Satyr camps.
