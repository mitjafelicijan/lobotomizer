Title: Taming the Beast
Description: When faced with a Young Forest Bear, one cannot simply remain indifferent towards its innocence and cuteness. They are formidable creatures, despite their youth, and will likely turn aggressive if they sense any threats. To tame one of these beasts is not an easy task. However, by doing so, you will acquire an unwavering companion who will be by your side forever. These bears will scare easily, but they can also be very cuddly once they get used to you.$B$BTo find them, head to the vicinity of the Logging Camp one more time. Oh, and beware of the Tower of Azoraâ€”its occupant seems to be a little off his rocker, with a soft spot for Gnomish assistants. Steer clear if you value your sanity.
Objective: Use the Taming Rod to tame a Young Forest Bear. Practice your skills, then return the Taming Rod to Daisy Windhelm in Goldshire.
