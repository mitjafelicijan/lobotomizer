Title: Taming the Beast
Description: Those crag boars are quite burly; maybe you'd like something with a little more finesse? Alright then, I've got jus' the thing. South and east of here, you'll find large white cats called snow leopards. Just like an elegantly-carved rifle, behind their beautiful exterior lies a powerful fighter, capable of doing extreme damage. You'll find them to be much more agile an' swift than the boar you tamed.$B$BTake this taming rod and see how you like the snow leopard.
Objective: Use the Taming Rod to tame a Snow Leopard. Practice your skills, then return to Grif Wildheart in Kharanos.
