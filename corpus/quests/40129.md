Title: Stealing a Core
Description: Hello again, impeccable timing! I have done what I can with the parts you acquired from the dig, but we're missing a crucial piece. This automaton's power source is some advanced crystalline power core.$B$BUnfortunately, the one in the chest has cracked, and it's energy has been depleted. None have been found here, and the dig has slowed down due to the golems. Do not despair though, similar power sources have been found in the Uldaman dig bordering between Loch Modan and the Badlands.$B$BThat dig has also run into issues with the Dark Irons and with awakened defenders. You helped out here, so why not head over there, help them out, and grab me a power core while you're at it?
Objective: Acquire an Intact Power Core from Uldaman's Ancient Treasure.
