Title: The Art of the Armorsmith
Description: Satisfaction. It is what I draw from the hammer and the anvil. To see a proud Horde warrior protected under my steel reminds me of what it is to be alive. It is an addiction that I dare never give up, $N.$B$BI can not grant you this satisfaction, merely set you upon the path. As with all of life's endeavors, the path of the armorsmith is a journey.$B$BIf you wish to be one of the select few, you need only to ask and I shall train, but, a task you must first complete.
Objective: To become an armorsmith, you must make the following items and return them to Okothos: 4 Ornate Mithril Helms, 2 Ornate Mithril Boots, 1 Ornate Mithril Breastplate.
