Description: The Gor'dosh Ogres are a fearsome foe. They battled us almost constantly when we made landfall, but we drove them back. It is only a matter of time before they are ready to strike again.$B$BNow that they are allied with Lapidis, they have become even bolder upon the island and must be stopped at any and all costs.

Objective: Slay 12 Gor'dosh Brutes, 8 Gor'dosh Ogres, and 5 Gor'dosh Shamans for Sergeant Blackwell in Caelan's Rest.
