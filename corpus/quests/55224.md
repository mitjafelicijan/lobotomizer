Title: Mathias' Letter
Description: Duke Ramon, well that certainly connects a lot of loose ends that we had here, at the least many of our agents can be pulled off other investigations thanks to this bit of detective work.$B$BI prepared this letter to be taken to Lord Commander Ryke back at Hawk's Vigil, it should contain all of the information he should need to bring justice to this man.$B$BAs for the House of Nobles, we shall continue our investigations, as of now it seems like this may just have been a Nobleman helping out a family friend and keeping them above the law, let us hope it is just that.
Objective: Bring Lord Commander Ryke in Hawk's Vigil Mathias' Letter.
