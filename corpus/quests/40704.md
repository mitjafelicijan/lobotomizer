Title: When Opportunity Knocks
Description: Blasted Gizzin, we're going to be extremely late with our delivery, and that means less money. A goblin must always think about the future, and with us stuck here there needs to be some creativity.$B$BNearby local Earth Elementals are wandering the cliffside, and perhaps there can be some profit made afterall.$B$BMy family always said, when opportunity knocks... Whatever that means. Either way big shot- you go, and get some Disturbed Elemental Cuffs, and bring them to me, sounds good yeah?
Objective: Gather 5 Disturbed Elemental Cuffs from the nearby Earth Elementals and return them to Frenz Lodefire in Stonetalon Mountains.
