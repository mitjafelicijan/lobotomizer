Title: Back to Thalanaar
Description: Here, brave adventurer.$B$B<The old pellar extends a weathered hand, carefully placing the Fang of Zalmos into your grasp>$B$BTake hold of this sacred relic, for it holds the essence of our ancient Wild God, Zalmos. It is a power that must not be taken lightly, for in the wrong hands, it could bring untold destruction. The Regents may not have been foolish enough to challenge us directly, but the enemy lurks in the shadows, waiting for their opportunity.$B$BGuard this Fang with utmost vigilance, for it is now your responsibility to ensure its safety. Should the enemy ever lay eyes upon it, their thirst for power and control will be unquenchable. May the blessings of the Wolf-Serpent guide and protect you on your journey, and may we meet again in a restored and prosperous Gilneas. And do not forget to convey my regards to the druid who sent you on this quest.
Objective: Bring Fang of Zalmos to Larodar in Thalanaar.
