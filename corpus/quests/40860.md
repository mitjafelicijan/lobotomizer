Title: The Dawnstone Coupler
Description: When Gnomeregan was built many years ago we had access to all sorts of materials from around the world. Dawnstone, one such material that we used, was excellent for being a coupler of energy. It was highly resistant to both magical, and powerful currents of energy. Making it highly versatile in its uses.$B$BWe have been unable to recreate any replicas to fix those that have broken down, having to replace them with subpar stand-ins that break much more often.$B$BThough it would appear we have a surge of luck on our side. You see, Gilneas has opened its gates once again. Rumors of civil problems are abound there.$B$BI need you to head to Gilneas far to the north and gather me a supply of four Dawnstone Ore. It should be found at the Dawnstone Mine near the city.
Objective: Travel to Gilneas in the north and collect 4 Dawnstone Chunks for Technician Voltgear at the Gnomeregan Reclamation Facility in Dun Morogh.
