Title: Highvale Rise
Description: I didn't think you had it in you, you certainly aint no ogre, but you did survive, and bring me those paws as proof.$B$BIf we want to -really- deal with the problem, we need to fight it at the source. All of the apes come from Highvale Rise, the giant mountain at the center of Tel'abim. It is there you will find the biggest, and strongest of their packs.$B$BTravel there, and slay fourteen Elder Highvale Gorillas, that should put a dent in their aggression, and maybe even save some wise goblin minds.
