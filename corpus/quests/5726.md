Title: Hidden Enemies
Description: One thing I will not tolerate are traitors in our midst, $N. But I would be a fool to play my hand so early--it would not sufficiently cut the corruption out of our lands and only cause the infection to grow worse.$B$BBut you, a young adventurer, could go places my agents could not... could learn the truth... could find the true head of the beast.$B$BIf you are brave enough, then enter Skull Rock to the east of Orgrimmar, find a lieutenant's insignia off one of the Burning Blade there, and return to me.
Objective: Bring a Lieutenant's Insignia to Thrall in Orgrimmar.
