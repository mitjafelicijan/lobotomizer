Title: Strategic Strike
Description: As much as I enjoy watching you grunts throw yourself into the meat grinder, this won't win us the battle. If we are to conquer these lands, we must decapitate their leadership. Gather the other grunts, and find Lady Katrin, the humans' battlefield strategist. Once their command structure crumbles, their footmen will be easy pickings for our warriors.
Objective: Search the battlefield for Lady Katrin and slay her.
