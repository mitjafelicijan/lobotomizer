Title: Rumors of Hateforge Brew
Description: There be rumors floatin' around about somethin' called 'Hateforge Brew'. The Dark Iron refer to it as something with reverance, and I know they aint makin' no ale in there.$B$BThe name is a cover up for somethin' else and we gotta find out just what that somethin' else is, ye get me? I do know that they have chemists within the Quarry, and my bet is they are linked to this Hateforge Brew.$B$BI need you to head in there, gather me a Dark Iron Vial and some Hateforge Chemistry Documents. I bet they have them stashed away somewhere in there about what's going on.
Objective: Delve into the Hateforge Quarry and recover a Dark Iron Vial, and the Hateforge Chemistry Documents, then return to Varlag Duskbeard at Morgan's Vigil in Burning Steppes.
