Title: The Secrets of Darkforging
Description: <Craftsman Wilhelm would take his time reading through the book, intrigue marks his features, and interest sparks his eyes>.$B$BThis book holds a lot of information, most of it doesn't seem to even relate to what we are doing, I mean, why would we even want Dark Binding Shackles in the first place?!$B$BThere are a few sections that may relate though, one of which is tainted, and twisted by a dark magic, making it unintelligable and frankly, unnerving. The other section seems to be written by a Dreadlord named Lorthiras, who could be of some use.$B$BI would first like to uncover the dark magic, and I believe I know someone who may be of help! Strahad Farsan used to be a friend of mine - we're not on the best terms, but he is quite deeply involved with shadowy magic, and demons both.$B$BHe is located in Ratchet, go and find him there, bring him the book.
Objective: Travel to Ratchet and speak with Strahad Farsan.
