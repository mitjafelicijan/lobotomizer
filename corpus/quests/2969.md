Title: Freedom for All Creatures
Description: The filthy Grimtotem clan are capturing faerie dragons, $N. Jer'kai and I have no idea what they plan on doing with them, but they're obviously up to no good.$B$BWe're not powerful enough to fight our way into the camp and free the captured dragons, but perhaps with your help...$B$BIf you're willing, and you have some strong friends, release the creatures from their cage with this key and make sure they escape with their lives. I'll be by your side the entire time. Jer'kai will remain here.
Objective: Using the Bamboo Cage Key, free the Sprite Darters from the pen in the Grimtotem camp. At least 6 Sprite Darters and Kindal Moonweaver must survive.$B$BYou have 6 minutes before Kindal decides it is time to retreat and you fail the quest.
