Title: Captain Barlgruf
Description: The Dark Iron Dwarves have been a long standing rival of ours, their attacks against our people have been ruthless. I have come to attempt to bolster our strength in the region, and if we want that to be possible, then we must set our sights on Angor Fortress.$B$BThe place is run by Captain Barlgruf, he has been sent from Shadowforge City to oversee actions here within the Badlands, cut him down, and the rest of them will be aimless. He should be inside Angor Fortress, no doubt nestled with the rest of his lackeys.$B$BKill him, and return to me.
Objective: Slay Captain Barlgruf within Angor Fortress for Senator Broadbelt in Badlands.
