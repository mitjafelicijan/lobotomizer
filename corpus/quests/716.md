Title: Stone Is Better than Cloth
Description: I know how cheap Lotwil can be, $N, so let me make you something for all your troubles. Maybe it'll even help protect you from the coming atrocity that is Lotwil's newest invention.$B$BI've been working with all the extra stones you collected for him, and I can make some nice bracers that you might want to use. They're enchanted, of course.$B$BI'll just need patterned bronze bracers crafted by a blacksmith so I can complete the bracers I'm making for you.
Objective: Bring some Patterned Bronze Bracers to Lucien Tosselwrench in the Badlands.
