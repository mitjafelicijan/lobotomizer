Title: Raider's New Mount
Description: Good. Now, a new task awaits you. As I said, I cannot leave this place. Not until I have a new wolf. My legs are not as swift as they used to be in my youth.$B$BSteal one from the Blackrock. Here, take this cage. Find a Young Blackrock Worg, capture it, and bring it to me. You can probably find a young worg in their stables in the Pillar of Ash. I will mold it into a worthy mount in no time.
Objective: Catch a Young Blackrock Worg and bring him back to Raider Fargosh in Karfang Hold.
