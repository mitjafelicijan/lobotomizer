Title: Taming the Beast
Description: You see kid, every time you add a pet to your collection you become stronger. Your pet is like an extension of you. We goblins may not be the strongest, but we got the biggest brains. Let the animal be your strength while you make with the plans!$B$BThat goes double for showing 'em who's boss, feel me? Why wrestle a beast into submission when you can outsmart 'em?$B$BLet's turn things up a notch. You're gonna have to get your boots wet for this next critter. This one really likes the sea, particularly past that Troll village down south.$B$BYou know the one... Sen'jin Village? Down near the Echo Isles. Keep your eyes peeled for a Surf Crawler, slap the ol' "Friend Request" on 'em, and bring it back to me.
Objective: Use the Taming Rod to tame a Surf Crawler. Practice your skills, then return the Taming Rod to Viz Fizbeast in Razor Hill.
