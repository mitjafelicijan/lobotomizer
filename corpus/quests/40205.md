Title: Securing Darnassus
Description: The Gnarlpine tribe in Teldrassil has become a greater threat than I could ever have imagined. To think they were once our allies against all who would bring the forests harm.$B$BMoon Priestess Amara patrols the roads between Darnassus and Dolanaar, keeping travelers safe and enlisting their aid in defending against the Gnarlpine attacking near the village. Alas, it seems these measures have not been sufficient in diminishing the Furbolgs' offensive capabilities.$B$BWe must strike at the heart of the tribe if we are to curtail any attempts at mobilizing against Dolanaar and Shadowglen, a legitimate concern now with how bold they've become. Travel to Gnarlpine Hold to the south and slay as many Avengers and Pathstalkers as you can.
Objective: Slay 10 Gnarlpine Avengers and 5 Gnarlpine Pathfinders and then return to Adaena Oakleaf in Darnassus.
