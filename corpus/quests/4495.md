Title: A Good Friend
Description: A friend of mine named Iverron usually visits me at the same time every day. The strange thing is that he hasn't been by today at all -- he's several hours late, in fact.$B$BI admit, I am a little worried, $N. Iverron spends a lot of time over by the cave to the north, and I'm sure you know how dangerous it is there -- spiders, everywhere!$B$BIf you happen to be going that way, though, will you keep an eye out for him?
Objective: Find Iverron by the cave to the north.
