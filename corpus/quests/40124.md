Title: Interfering Naga
Description: Even the ley-shards of the city of Eldarath have their energies compromised. This could be the work of the Naga that have encroached and invaded from the ocean depths. I would not put it past the beasts, as savage as they are, for attempting to claim dominion over the landscape.$B$BWe must look into this matter further before claiming we have gotten this solved. I have prepared a scroll of dispelling. Use it upon the Spitelash Shrine they have in their clutches. If they are behind this dampening, this should solve the problem. While you're there, slay their sirens as well, they are the ones who wield a crude and foul magic.
Objective: Slay 15 Spitelash Sirens and dispel the magic at the Spitelash Shrine.
