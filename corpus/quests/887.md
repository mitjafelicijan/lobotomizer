Title: Southsea Freebooters
Description: I sure wish Vice Admiral Grezzlik did a better job of keeping the seas safe for our trading vessels. With all the gold the trade princes have poured into the Trade Fleets, it ticks me off to see so many pirates running willy-nilly, raiding my ships and stealing my goods!$b$bI heard that the Southsea Freebooters have set up a camp just south of here. They've been a real thorn in my side and if Grezzlik won't take care of them, well, maybe you can help me get rid of them.
Objective: Kill 12 Southsea Brigands and 6 Southsea Cannoneers for Gazlowe in Ratchet.
