Title: The Future Looks Grim
Description: I know all of the draught that clouds the minds of my warriors, your collusion with my dreadlord and the deathguard you've squandered at his behest.$B$BBut perhaps you have grown fond of Varimathras. Would you like to be one of his playthings? One word and I will make sure you are his. Forever.$B$BNo? You yet value your soul? Pity.$B$BThen you will do as I say and go to Tyr's Hand, in the Eastern Plaguelands. Fetch a Scarlet uniform from those zealous fools and bring it to Gunther. He will know the rest.$B$BGo now, begone from my sight.
Objective: Travel to Tyr's Hand in the Eastern Plaguelands, obtain a Scarlet Initiate Uniform, then return to Gunther Arcanus on the isle of Brightwater Lake.
