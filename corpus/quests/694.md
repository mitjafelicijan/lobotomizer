Title: Trelane's Defenses
Description: All rested?$B$BHere's our next step: there're ogres all around the Tower of Arathor in Stromgarde. We're gonna need to activate the tower's defenses if you're gonna stand a chance against 'em an' still make it to the items alive. To do that, we're gonna need some gems the Boulderfist shaman have taken a liking to. They took 'em from the tower, but they're not gonna stay in their possession for long.$B$BGet one of them gems an' bring 'em to Kryten--he knows the spell to enchant 'em so they'll work as a key.
Objective: Find an Azure Agate and bring it to Apprentice Kryten at Refuge Pointe.
