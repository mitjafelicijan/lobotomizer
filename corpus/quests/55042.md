Title: Satisfaction for Shak
Description: Long before I came to this place, I was quite a valuable member of the Venture Co.$B$BThat was a long time ago though, and a different me, but if anything stuck, it's the stupid nickname I got.$B$BWhen I was one of the engineers, I was comissioned to make a design for a mega shredder to deforest Stonetalon.$B$BTurns out, another design was better then mine, and by quite a bit. I don't have a problem with that, but what I got a problem with is being fired from Foreman Klix for "letting him down".$B$BHe called me a "hack", and now the nickname has stuck. Bastard's got what's coming to him. You'll find him out at the Windshear crag where I used to work at the old lumbermill. He's an old coot and I doubt he's moved on.$B$BBring me his ring, it's this oversized studded thing he wears over his middle finger.
Objective: Kill Foreman Klix and bring his Studded Ring to Shak.
