Title: Operation Help Jabbey
Description: <Jabbey looks at the list with an expression of disbelief, and laughs.>$B$BHaha! He thinks I am going to give out such valuable items that easy? Look kid, these things are rare, and extremely valuable, but if he needs them, and wants them, I have a favor I need completed before I even consider forking over something like that. Easy yeah?$B$BI did some business with one of those Dark Iron types, he went by the name 'Darneg Darkbeard' lets just say I leant him a considerable amount of potent goods to sell. I haven't heard back at all from him, and I have confirmation that I was swindled. I need you to travel to Blackrock Depths, and into Shadowforge to recover the 'Extremely Potent Snuff' from him. He should be somewhere in the Domicile there.
Objective: Venture into Blackrock Depths, and recover the 'Extremely Potent Snuff' from Darneg Darkbeard near the Domicile, for Jabbey at Steamwheedle Port in Tanaris.
