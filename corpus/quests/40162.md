Title: The Evil Deeptide
Description: Hello! My name is Smallgill, I was once apart of the Murlocs, all until we came here, and they joined with the slithery naga! They go by the name Deeptide now, and attack any who come near, they even stole my necklaces!$B$BThose were mine, that I made, and that I gave to friends, and they stole each and every one of them. I tried to ask nicely but they hurt me, and I want them back. Could you please, oh very please get me some my necklaces back? I don't need all of them, just a few, maybe six? I know that the other murlocs around here have them, so, make sure you ask nicely.
Objective: Collect 6 Lovely Shell Necklace's for Smallgill in Gillijim's Island.
