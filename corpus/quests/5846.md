Title: Of Love and Family
Description: When Taelan was a child, we would oft visit Caer Darrow on family excursions. On our last visit, an artist by the name of Renfray painted a portrait of us poised along the beachside. It is my fondest memory of both Taelan and Karandra. For it was at that moment, with my wife and son in my arms, that I felt a bond of love and family that I would never know again.$B$BIf this painting still exists, you must find it.$B$BTravel to the ruined island of Caer Darrow and see if the painting or the artist remain.
Objective: Travel to island of Caer Darrow, in the south-central region of the Plaguelands, and look for any clues as to the whereabouts of the painting.
