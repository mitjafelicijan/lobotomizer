Title: Foul Magics
Description: I have felt a strangeness in the air... a feeling that simmers in my blood. I had my suspicions. I set off to find the source of my unease and discovered to the west, at Northfold Manor, the residual traces of demonic summoning. As I got close, my blood began to boil and the rage within me grew.$b$bOn the ground I spied an amulet of bloodstone, used to assist in demonic summoning. The one I found was depleted, however. I'll need another to examine, but I dare not return to the manor. Can you bring me some?
Objective: Get 10 Bloodstone Amulets for Tor'gan in Hammerfall.
