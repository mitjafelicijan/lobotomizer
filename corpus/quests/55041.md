Title: Wisdom of the Sages
Description: You ever heard the saying "knowledge is power"? Well, a lot of my goblin kin have not.

An archivist by the name of Landas is holding it.$B$BProblem is, this isn't just some guy with a book, he's one of them mages from Dalaran, and getting my hands on it isn't gonna be easy.$B$BThey're pretty protective over their stuff, so that's where you come in.$B$BI got some info recently that he was in the heights overlooking the Hillsbrad Fields and the internment camp fairly close to Dalaran. Find him, and get me that book.
Objective: Find the book "Wisdom of the Sages" and bring it to Krez the Wise.
