Title: For Her
Description: Here, take a closer look, us Wildhammer have a certain technique on how to sew the feathers to the headdress. Ye can't learn this anywhere else. They're passed down from generation to generation...$B$B<You watch Doran sew the feathers to the headdress. He looks more distressed than before, but is very diligent and graceful with both framing and feathers.>$B$BAight, this is how a real Wildhammer headdress is crafted, if yer were a fledgling ye'd take this to yer first gryphon ridin' lesson. Wearin' it while yer bondin' to yer gryphon is a magical moment in the life of any adolescent Wildhammer. I still remember mine like it was yesterday. Ya, like yesterday...$B$B<Doran pauses for a moment and takes a deep breath.>$B$BI'm sorry, friend. I told ye this is fer ye, but would ye be kind enough to put the headdress on a grave on Aerie Peak's graveyard? It is the tombstone between the rune-marked trees, to yer right as ye enter. $B$BIf ye could do this fer me, this ole dwarf would be forever in yer debt.
Objective: Place the Wildhammer Feather Headdress on the tombstone Doran described in Aerie Peak's graveyard.
