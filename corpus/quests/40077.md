Description: Howdy, partner! Don't see many new faces here, especially in this old, beaten-up castle! Surely you've heard the rumors of brave defenders holding off the orcs for days on end before being destroyed! What a tale. I could also tell you stories about the mushrooms in Swamp of Sorrows, especially Sorrowmoss Mushrooms!$B$BSorrowmoss Mushrooms only grow within this region. They have a certain... "taste" to them once you figure out how to cook them properlyâ€”because if you don't, well, it's deadly! I have a few friends from my old hometown who would love to try some. You'll be a pal and help me get them, right?$B$BAll I need is ten. That should do just nicely partner!
