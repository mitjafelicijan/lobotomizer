Title: She Sells Sea Shells
Description: Hey, pal, ever heard of Shellcoin? It's an absolute craze among those wanting to shoot high in their monetary endeavors. There is no other way for a quick and reliable head start to becoming your own trade prince! The only catch on the matter is: you need a budget to even start with Shellcoin trading! And no one except the ones in Rustgate's tower have enough gold for that.$B$BHowever, me being the genius mastermind that I am, I already came up with a brilliant solution! The shells that drift ashore on this island look almost identical to Shellcoin!$B$BOkay, here's the pitch: bring me enough of those shells and we split them fifty-fifty. You can find them along the beach just north of here, or from those gnolls that seem to wander the coast and collect them. Once you got twenty, return to me and we can strike rich!
Objective: Gather 20 Blackstone Sea Shells along the eastern beach for Schera Framesnap at Gazzik's Workshop on Blackstone Island.
