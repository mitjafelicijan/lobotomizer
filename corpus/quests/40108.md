Title: The Lone Wolf
Description: The time has come, $N. A new path has been shown to me by the Earth Mother. What once was lost must be found again. The shards of this vision still echo in my mind, $C. Travel to the north in the Barrens and seek out a powerful Farseer Logrash amongst the mountains west of Durotar. Only with his help will we be able to locate the missing plates of Uldum. Go now, and may the Earth Mother guide your path.
Objective: Sage Truth Seeker wants you to search for the Farseer Logrash in the northern part of the Barrens.
