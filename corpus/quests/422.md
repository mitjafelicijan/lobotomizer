Title: Arugal's Folly
Description: How Arugal gained acceptance within the Kirin Tor is beyond me.His spell-casting knowledge seemed as transparent as a blown glass bauble.$b$bWhat's important now is learning exactly what magic Arugal used so that I can turn it against him and secure Silverpine Forest for the Dark Lady.$b$bArugal first stayed at the wheat farm just north of the bridge.One of the Deathstalkers reported seeing some spellbooks but could not secure them.Retrieve for me the spell labeled Remedy of Arugal from those books.
Objective: Retrieve the Remedy of Arugal for Dalar Dawnweaver at the Sepulcher.
