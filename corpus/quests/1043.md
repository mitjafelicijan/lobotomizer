Title: The Scythe of Elune
Description: Your story rings true... I do not entirely understand your motives, but if your business here in Duskwood involves ridding the forest of worgen in any number, then I can forgo understanding for results.$b$bThere is a mine to the south that has been overrun with worgen... They appeared out of nowhere, but from what we know, that is where they first were found.$b$bGo about your business, but I would ask that if you find anything of import, you share it with me. We will accept any aid in our war against evil.
Objective: Look for signs of the Scythe of Elune then return to Jonathan Carevin in Darkshire.
