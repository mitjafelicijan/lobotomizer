Title: The Shadowforge Menace
Description: Well met, $r. I have a mission to test your skills, and prove your mettle to the Kargath Expeditionary Force. Make no mistake, your performance will make itself known to not just us, but our brothers in Orgrimmar as well.$B$BSo. Assuming you won't flee with your tail between your legs, head to the dwarven fortress to the north east. You will notice it jutting out of the land like a boil, ready to be lanced. Decimate the denizens there. Return when you have slain the bulk of their forces.
Objective: Slay 12 Shadowforge Warriors and 8 Shadowforge Chanters for Warlord Goretooth at Kargath in the Badlands.
