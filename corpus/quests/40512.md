Description: Magical grains huh? Well I'm the one that enchanted them long long ago. They were made to help the cavalry and help the livestock plow the fields faster and longer, but then tragedy struck.$B$BThe orcs invaded what is now known as Go'shek Farm and the entire stock of the grain has been lost since then.$B$BIf you're lucky you might still find a sack of it, presuming the orcs didn't get their filthy hands on it.$B$BI wish you good luck and I hope we meet again one day.
Objective: Find a sack of the Magical Grains in Go'shek Farm in Arathi Highlands, and bring them to Tarrel Holk at Stromgarde Keep.
