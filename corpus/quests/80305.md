Title: Quark's Shack
Description: Hey kid, enjoying yourself?$B$BNah, you're really not. I can see it on your face. This place is pretty run-down and boring with no real stuff to do, eh?$B$BWell, if you're looking for some action, coin-action, mind you, then I got something for ya! But, you know, info doesn't come cheap, now does it?$B$BHow about a silver coin to loosen up my tongue?$B$B<The goblin waits with an open hand while grinning at you.>$B$BWell, now that we are friends, I suppose I can let you in on this little something. Something that I've heard around town. See, there's this bar that just opened up in the Valley of Honor. Quite ironic, don't you think?$B$BI heard a goblin named Quark opened up a shop, but it's supposed to be a membership-only enterprise.$B$BI wouldn't bother going there myself, but I heard there's good money to be made!$B$BNow, that'll be fifty copper for the intel. Have a nice day, pal.
Objective: Go to the Valley of Honor and search for Quark's Shack.
