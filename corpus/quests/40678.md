Title: Health and Safety, mon
Description: Why do you think I fish, mon? It's a lot calmer and less dangerous than fighting... that's for sure. $B$BNow, recently I've been getting my fishing rods stolen by Drysnaps, huge they are! And they can rip an arm off if you're not careful...$B$BThis isn't what I need in my mornings, mon. If you be killin' them for me, you'd be doing myself and the village a big service.
Objective: Kill 8 Drysnap Pincers and 8 Drysnap Crawlers for Jinar'Zillen at Shadowprey Village in Desolace.
