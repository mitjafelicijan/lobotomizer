Title: Naming the Vessel
Description: Seems like the pirate life suits ye, ye scoundrel. Ah, I remember of me own adventures, to be young again. Anyway, since the ship's all yours and all, thought it'd be the time for you to name it, savvy?$B$BI bet ye already got a name in mind, whenever ye feel ready.
Objective: Decide the name of the ship.
