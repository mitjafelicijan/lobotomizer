Title: The Singing Crystals
Description: Legends tell of a jewel, hidden deep in the heart of Stranglethorn.We call it the Mind's Eye, and it has great powers.If you gain this Eye then, perhaps, we can use it to bring lost Yenniku back from the darkness.$B$BI will consult with the spirits of the jungle to find the Mind's Eye.While I do this, you enter the Crystalvein Mine, southeast of here, and gather Pulsing Blue Shards from Ironjaw Basilisks.The shards are rare, but we will need their magic to bend the Mind's Eye to our will.
Objective: Bring 3 Pulsing Blue Shards to Kin'weelay at the Grom'gol Base Camp.
