Title: Morgan's Discovery
Description: Well, I'll be. It looks like Aristan might be on to something after all. I found traces of substances used in love potions and insidious mind-altering draughts.$b$bIt isn't unheard of for perfumes to have some of them, but a few of the ingredients I detected... Smells funny.
Objective: Return to Aristan Mottar outside the bank in Stormwind's Trade District.
