Title: Ashen Pelts
Description: I am keeping an eye on the pump here day in and day out. All around the clock I stand here and watch this cranky old thing hold on to dear life and try to make it keep doing so for the foreseeable future. Should this baby ever stop, I'm in for a whole new world of trouble - trouble I would like to avoid.$B$BThe nights are getting colder by the day and I am not allowed to make a campfire in case it burns down the pump. Luckily I'm a proficient leatherworker and can make myself a fine coat against the cold.$B$BIf you bring me pelts from the hyenas around here, I'll make you something too. Deal?
Objective: Bring 6 Ashpaw Pelts to Pumpworker Fizzlo at The Water Hole.
