Title: Delivery for Bromley
Description: A Dalaran wizard stopped by a few weeks ago, believe it or not! I've never met a wizard from Dalaran, and his magic was impeccable. I mean it! He offered us some help with a few projects but asked for some supplies in return. I haven't had the means to get them to him yet, given all of the danger between me and the camp he is at up north of here.$B$BDo me a favor, would you? Run my delivery to Magus Bromley. You can find him to the northwest of Lake Mennar. He has a tent overlooking the Ruins of Eldarath, just on the ridges there!
Objective: Deliver Gigno's Shipment to Magus Bromley in Azshara.
