Title: The Old Church of Westfall II
Description: You found this at the Westfall Church?$B$BIt has been a long time since I have heard anything about that place, another abandoned relic of a potentially bright past. It is a shame what happened there, but it is a story that is much like the rest of the region.$B$BThe western side of Westfall was the first to be removed, and there are not many who remain who can give us information, many of those farmers were either murdered, or disappeared into secrecy.$B$BThere is someone that I can think of, Baros Alexston, he made something of himself after everything went down, and became an Architect in Stormwind City, you can find him in Cathedral Square if you don't mind looking into this matter, maybe he can give us some details about who ran the church, or even what happened to it.
Objective: Speak with Baros Alexston in Stormwind.
