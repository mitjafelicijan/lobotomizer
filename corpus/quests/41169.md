Title: Bearer Of Bad News
Description: Take a look at this island. What do you see? Exactly. You see us losing money! If I told you what the reasons for us losing money are, then we'd be staying here all night. And I for one can't afford that and neither can you. When Blastentom suggested the monetization of this island I was all ears, but this is one-hundred percent NOT what I signed up for!$B$BBlastentom expects a report from me about the status quo around here. I definitely don't want to be at the receiving end of his anger, luckily you unfortunate bugger are here to go in my stead.$B$BTake this, and bring it to Nert Blastentom at Sparkwater Port in Durotar. You surely don't want to swim all the way back, so catch a ride at Gazzik's Workshop. Prepare to pay up, this ain't a charity around here. If you're not back by tomorrow, I will file an arrest and have you executed for desertion!
Objective: Pay for a ride at Gazzik's Workshop and bring Rustgate's Business Report to Nert Blastentom at Sparkwater Port.
