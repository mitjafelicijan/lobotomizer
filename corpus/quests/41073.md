Title: A Special Task
Description: It is my duty to investigate the mysteries of nature and protect the balance of the forest. However, our current mission has been a failure thus far, and it fills me with anger and frustration.$B$BThe Grove of the Ancients to the southwest, once alive and vibrant, now lays dead and lifeless. Their sacrifice was in vain, unlike that of Ethwyr, who was able to cleanse this settlement of corruption. I need to know why.$B$BOne of our own, Marlonias Shademoon, has been sent to investigate the grove. However, he has yet to return, and knowing his lazy demeanor, he is likely preoccupied with finding new ways to avoid fulfilling his duties.$B$BLocate him and remind him of his responsibilities. He has a mission to fulfill, and I will not tolerate any negligence on his part.
Objective: Find Marlonias Shademoon. He has been sent to investigate a Grove of the Ancients in Irontree Woods.
