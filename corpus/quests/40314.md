Title: The Mystery of Karazhan IV
Description: I have taken the time to study what has been provided, and based off the sample he has sent there is no doubt about the power that has produced such a energy. The magic that is present within the substance is that of necromancy, with a touch of arcane.$B$BThere is one who could be capable of such magic. One who studied beneath Medivh for a short period of time, and took to keeping watch of the Crypt itself, he went by the name Alarus. If it truly is him, then he has mastered his magic, and is extremely capable, and even more dangerous.$B$BWhatever lingers beneath Karazhan must be stopped , especially with Karazhan itself holding so much potency of magic.$B$BIf this darkness is resting beneath Karazhan, then it must be within the Crypts directly beneath it. Return to Ariden Dusktower, and let him know everything.
Objective: Return to Ariden Dusktower with the information Ansirem Runeweaver has provided.
