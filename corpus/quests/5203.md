Can you help me, $N?$B$BOur equipment isn't far from here, and you've already proven you can survive the path to the top.$B$BAfter we escape, I'll head to Darnassus if you can find my friend Jessir near the Ashenvale border. She was to meet us at the Emerald Circle's camp near there.$B$BWhat do you say, $N? Can you help me again?
