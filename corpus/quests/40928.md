Recently, they attacked and laid claim to Southmire Orchard, where a good friend of mine named Ernest met his end.$B$BWhile I still grieve for his loss, I cannot stand idle. The foulhide will soon move to find another target to enact their rampant desire to fight and the Shademore Tavern could be their next target.$B$BI ask of you to head to my friend's orchard to the southeast of here, and slay the gnolls that inhabit it. Bring me fourteen of their armbands as proof.
