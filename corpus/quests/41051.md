Title: Feeding the Younglings
Description: Ah, the voracious appetite of young chimaeras! There's nothing quite like it. These little ones can devour twice their weight in a single day, but they are quite particular about their meals. While impudent trainers may have been a tempting choice in the past, we must focus on satisfying their hunger with more suitable fare.$B$BIn this case, their favorite delicacy happens to be hippogryphs. Deep within the High Wilderness, a sizable flock of hippogryphs has been spotted. I task you with hunting them down and bringing me twenty chunks of their meat. This will provide a hearty feast to nourish the soon-to-hatch chimaeras and satisfy their growing appetites.
Objective: Bring 20 Chunks of Hippogryph Meat to Velos Sharpstrike at Chimaera Roost Vale in Feralas.
