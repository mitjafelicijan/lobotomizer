Of course there's a reward involved, how else could it be around here? It's a Mirage Raceway after all!$B$BWhat to do? Oh, that's so simple, I'm sure that even a gnome would manage to test our jolly vehicle on the sustain for â€¦ errh, durability conditions! Yes! So, if you're ready to earn some coins and crack some scorpids flat then you're at the right spot, kid! What helmet? Instruction? Bah! Who needs'em anyway?!$B$BYes, you might want to talk to our charming Dolores to register for the test race, $N.$B$BLet's blast it!
