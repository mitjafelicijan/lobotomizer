Title: Hints of a New Plague?
Description: I've seen Kinelory look way worse after a night in the tavern than she does now. You obviously did a good job protecting her.$B$BThese items she brought back from the farm should at least let Phin get an idea of what's going on out here in Arathi. Just to make sure there's no retaliation after your attack, we're going to stay here for a bit longer. Would you be willing to head back to Southshore and talk to Phin?
Objective: Find Phin Odelic in Southshore.
