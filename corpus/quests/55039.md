Title: Seeking Lost Answers
Description: The Kingdom of Alterac fell to ruin after their betrayal of the Alliance. I find it fitting that a nation of traitors soon after became a roving band of brigands, pilferers and cut-throats.$B$BIt is those who lay ruin to the lands and take which is not truly theirs in the first place.$B$BThe Syndicate have stolen from Dalaran a tome of great importance that the Kirin Tor require back. It is the third part of the rock elemental compendiums.$B$BThere are many building projects being done in and around Dalaran, and such a book is needed to keep our control over the Elementals around us.$B$BSyndicate Wizards have taken the book to the small town of Strahnbrad in the Alterac Mountains.$B$BTake back that which was taken from us, and dispense justice to the uncivil curs.
Objective: Retrieve the Rock Elemental Mastery: Compendium III from Syndicate Wizards in Strahnbrad.
