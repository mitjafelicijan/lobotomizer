Title: A Potential Clue
Description: So, Zabini may be on to something actually, in all my research I have been unable to locate the source of this magic, whoever has been using it seems to know their craft.$B$BBut, there may be a clue in the information he has provided.$B$BLord Commander Ryke knows all the coming's and going's of Hawk's Vigil, and more precisely who is new to the town.$B$BIf someone has come in the last few weeks, then perhaps we can look to them as a potential source of this darkness, or at the least, investigate it.
Objective: Speak with Lord Commander Ryke.
