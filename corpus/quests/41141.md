Title: I've Read It In A Book Once
Description: I heard what you were talking about with Brok. Almost impossible with his yapping, you can't even hear your own creative thoughts! He might've told you that I'm an amateur blacksmith, but that couldn't be further from the truth! You'll find no one better among us Wildhammer dwarves - besides our dear mother, of course.$B$BIt is true, however. I do intend to present Mother with a weapon to prove her once and for all to stop wasting time on that buffoon, who crafts his weapons on emotional whims and disregards tradition, technique and - most of all - class! He'd be better off in some backwater Bronzebeard village, if you ask me.$B$BSince you helped him, it is only fair that you help me, too. The books I've bought from the recent traveling merchants describe giants of stone created by nature magic. Their bodies are full of energized minerals, ideal for my weapon! The lush forests of northern Feralas are the place they call home. Get me some sizable samples from their bodies, please.
Objective: Sindri Thunderforge needs samples of mountain giants for his creation. He specifically mentioned the ones living in Feralas.
