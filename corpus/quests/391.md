Title: The Stockade Riots
Description: Let's get one thing straight, $N: I don't trust you. But, with the situation as it is, you probably won't make a difference.$B$BSo here's how it's going to be: go down there and have your talk with Thredd. If you're really on our side, then kill him and bring me his head when the job's done. And if it turns out you're on his side, and don't come out... when we find you, you'll die along with the rest of the maggots.
Objective: Kill Bazil Thredd and bring his head back to Warden Thelwater at the Stockade.
