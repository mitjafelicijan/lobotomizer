Title: Pursuing Harmony
Description: Our new neighbors certainly are quite an interesting bunch. The dwarves here at Bael Hardul have been quite gracious in their hosting.$B$BI am Maloran, a delegate on behalf of Stonetalon Peak, sent to make sure that the natural order is not disturbed. I will admit I held caution when I first arrived, but thus far, Whitepeak has been fairly respectable.$B$BThis has left me to pursue my real purposes. Beneath us to the west the Venture Co. has laid unmarked terror to the fabric of nature, and I wish to see if the local Deepmoss have been affected.$B$BTravel to the west, and gather me a Pristine Deepmoss Brain, I will use it for study.
Objective: Gather at Pristine Deepmoss Brain from the local Deepmoss spiders for Maloran Oakbranch at Bael Hardul in Stonetalon Mountains.
