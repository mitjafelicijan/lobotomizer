Title: Kaldorei Weaponry
Description: So, that is the judgement of the High Priestess, is it. What a joke. My desire to save lives is seen as cowardice, whereas the commanderâ€™s desire for bloodlust is seen as heroism?$B$BPerhaps it really is time for me to return to the hills of my youth. I shall fly with the hawks, swim with the fish and hunt with the wolves, and I expect I will find far less duplicity amongst all of them than with your sentinel friends.
Objective: Return to Commander Starwind for a reward.
