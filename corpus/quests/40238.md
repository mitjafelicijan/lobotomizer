Title: A Meeting With The Dreadlord
Description: While you were gone collecting what I asked I took the time to decipher the incoherent text. It was written by a Dreadlord named Lorthiras and contained some insights into the secrets of Rune crafting.$B$BNow, in truth, there is not much to be gained from the text, to be able to temper a Runeblade, one would need to possess the powers that Dreadlords would, and such knowledge is very rarely given out.$B$BWithin the text were mentions of a place that Lorthirus spent much of his time studying in his magic and if you wish to have a chance at tempering the Runeblade then you must seek him out.$B$BI feel like I can not be of further assistance, but I have jotted down the text onto a script for your reading, perhaps you can make more sense of it then me.
Objective: Find Lorthiras on Azeroth, and speak with him.
