Title: Mysteries of the Grove
Description: I have heard rumblings from some of the druids in the region of an elvish grove hidden away that has been corrupted. Suppose such darkness can lurk and remain undisturbed. In that case, it could mean horrible things for the forest and nature itself.$B$BI have a scout who has recently checked up on such a disturbance. I would like his report before dedicating resources to eliminating corruption within Ashenvale. You can find him just down the road to the southwest, at a small camp. He goes by the name Feran Strongwind, and he will tell you what he knows.
Objective: Speak with Feran Strongwind outside of Splintertree Post.
