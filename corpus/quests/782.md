Title: Broken Alliances
Description: From the Horde's alliance with the dragon Deathwing during the Second War, we know that two of his lieutenants, Blacklash and Hematus, were imprisoned within Lethlor Ravine far to the east. We must silence our depraved allies of old to restore honor to the Horde!$B$BWe hired Tho'grun and his band of ogre mercenaries to help us obtain the Sign of the Earth, a key needed to unlock the drakes' prison. Tho'grun betrayed us though, overwhelming us and taking it for himself. Go to Camp Boff and take it back!
Objective: Kill Boss Tho'grun and bring the Sign of the Earth to Gorn in Kargath.
