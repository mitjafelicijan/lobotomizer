Title: Delivery to Cross
Description: I once came from the city of Stormwind, and traveled to Kul Tiras, that was before the fleet ventured here, to Theramore. Ever since me and my brother have been seperated and while I have heard good things about him, and his business I haven't had any opportunity to deliver a letter, especially being stuck here at my post.$B$BIf you ever find yourself in Stormwind, would you mind stopping by The Silver Shield in the Old Town of Stormwind? My brother Bryan is the one that runs the place, and it would mean the world to me if you could run him this letter.
Objective: Deliver Wallace's Letter to Bryan Cross in Stormwind City.
