Title: The Harvest Golem Mystery
Description: Alright, you helped me well. I will spare you running errands and just send you to do what you do best. Kill.$B$BGnolls in the hills of Redridge have been giving me and other traders a hard time lately. It's bad for business. I lost two shipments with rare materials this month only! They probably still hoard them somewhere in their camps up north. Check it out.$B$BI want you to look especially for one lost shipment - rare needles from Lordaeron. You will know when you see them.
Objective: Find the Lordaeron Needles among the gnoll hovels and bring them to Franklin Hamar in Lakeshire.
