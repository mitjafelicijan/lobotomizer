Title: Supplementing Rations
Description: Many of the refugees here in the camp and at the Greymane Wall are starving. The threat of the worgen has been enough to deter most from foraging or hunting. I request you to aid in our situation and perhaps I can get a decent meal for everyone.$B$B The Duskpelt wolves are hostile, but should supplement our current rations well. You can find Duskpelt wolves all around Gilneas. Bring me six chunks of their meat and it should last us for a time.
Objective: Gather 6 Duskpelt Meat from the Duskpelt wolves for Camp Chef Velden at the Vagrant Encampment in northern Gilneas.
