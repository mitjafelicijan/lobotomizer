Title: News of Dogran
Description: My mate, Dogran, was recently sent to the Crossroads for duty. It was a promotion, and he was very proud.$b$bI was sad, of course, but I didn't let him know that. And worried, too. The Barrens is a more dangerous place than Orgrimmar, and I feared the worst.$b$bNow it's been a week after he should have returned, and I have received no word from him...$b$bPerhaps you could go to the Crossroads and see if they have any news? He worked with Gazrog, who should still be stationed there.
Objective: Speak with Gazrog at the Crossroads.
