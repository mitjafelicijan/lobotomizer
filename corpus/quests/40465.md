Title: Discovering Golem Secrets
Description: Hey there, I got a strange request for you if you don't mind helping. I used to be an Arcanasmith within Shadowforge and worked with all kinds of Golem Cores.$B$BMy loyalty to ol' Orvak got me tossed out with the rest of the miners. Whenever we get out of this here camp I want to continue my work and I'd like a head start.$B$BUp to the north are the Ruins of Thaurissan. The Dark Irons there have War Reaver patrols, which are powered by Golem Cores. Get me three of them, so we can see what kind of power they contain.
Objective: Gather 3 Golem Cores for Radgan Deepblaze at Blackrock Pass in Burning Steppes.
