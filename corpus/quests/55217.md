Title: Zabini's Information
Description: The dark magic within Hawk's Vigil has seemingly appeared out of nowhere, its presence went undetected by myself and my kin for quite a while.$B$BOr at the least has only cropped up at the last few weeks at a level where many, like myself and Marge, would have come to notice it.$B$BI am under the belief that either a dormant force has been slowly gaining power for some time, or that perhaps something, or some one, has recently come to Hawk's Vigil with such potency.$B$BI wish you luck in finding what is causing the tainting darkness, I sensed something similar before the third war and do not wish to re-live the experience. Tell Marge what little I know, it may be of assistance.
Objective: Bring Zabini's information to Marge Blackwood.
