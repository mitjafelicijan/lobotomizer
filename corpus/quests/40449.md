Title: Protecting the Crops!
Description: Howdy friend!$B$BWe have been dealing with all sorts of problems ever since we first started settling here, from raptor, to giant spider, to ogre!$B$BChaser has done well enough with scaring off the local wildlife but they have just gotten too aggresive as of recently, from trampling on our fields to even fighting with us. It's gotten so bad infact I had to send my son into Stromgarde until things calmed down.$B$BIf you could clean up some of the critters, that would go much appreciated for me and my wife. About ten of those Plains Creeper's and ten more of the Highland Thrasher's should do just fine.
Objective: Slay 10 Plains Creeper's and 10 Highland Thrasher's for Oswald Livingstone at the Livingstone Croft in Arathi Highlands.
