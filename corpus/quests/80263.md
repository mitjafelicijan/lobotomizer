Title: Teslinah's Search III
Description: Let's try the big castle next! I hear the king's son is really nice. We can also try the old part of town. I think it has a tavern too. Oh, and let's look at that Gnomish tram I've heard about! Maybe she's waiting there.
Objective: Search for Teslinah's mom in Stormwind.
