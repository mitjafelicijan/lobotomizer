Title: Raene's Cleansing
Description: I wish your tidings were better.$B$BRaene is correct, I know about Dartol's creation and the treants in the area--at least I did once. They've become corrupted now, their nature twisted.$B$BIf your goal is to find the next piece of the rod, then you'll have to find the key to open the chest it's in.$B$BThe wooden key is on one of the treants northeast of here, near Felwood. Once you have it, look for a small glade west of the road near the Felwood border... the chest should be hidden around there.
Objective: Find the Wooden Key and a piece of Dartol's Rod before returning to Shael'dryn at the moonwell.
