Title: Zoki is No Thief!
Description: What? Zoki is no thief! Zoki is an honorable orc, sure, Zoki reminds weak children sometimes who the strongest is but all he does is tell the truth! Linthea and Daniel are very scrawny and Vhreka just wants to be a boring old lady who talks to the elements. Zoki will be a great warrior just like Saurfang or his brother! Or maybe like Grommash, Matron says he was a Horde hero.$B$BWhy do you insist to annoy Zoki with stolen presents? I didn't steal anything, I promise on my honor! I remember the Matron said one of the snowmen lost their gloves and they found out eventually that they were stolen, maybe go ask them?
Objective: Speak with Mr. Mistletoe about the stolen gifts missing in Winter Veil Vale!
