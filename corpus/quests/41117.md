Title: The Tablet of Zef'ek
Description: You there, mage!$B$BYou did well for me, and us magi must look out for one another. I must ask you another favor. This time it is something more personal. I have been studying the Temple of Atal'hakkar for some time now, and have heard a mystery about the Tablet of Zef'ek. According to legend, it tells the tale of the great troll warlord who created the temple that rests here in the swamp.$B$BOr something like that anyway. What is more important is the magic imbued within the stone. I want you to recover this tablet for me. It is held near the Chamber of Blood, by the chanting Kazkaz the Unholy within the temple. Find it, and bring it to me.
Objective: Gather the Tablet of Zef'ek for Thultazor in Stonard.
