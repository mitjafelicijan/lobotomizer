Title: Delayed Shipments
Description: Supplies are beginning to run low. We were waiting on a shipment from Sparkwater Port in Durotar, but the ship got wrecked by an unknown source on the southern coast. Most of the crew ended up as fish fodder, but the captain and his first mate survived and are currently observing the wreckage.$B$BI want to know when I can expect the supplies to be here. I am here for results and financial growth, not semantics or empathy. Ask Dazlon Brassdigger on the cliff overlooking the coast just south of here what you can do about retrieving the sunken goods.
Objective: Dazlon Brassdigger south of the Black Ash Coalpits can tell you more about his ship's wreckage.
