Title: Underground Assault
Description: Gnomeregan has fallen under the control of those dastardly troggs! The situation is grave but perhaps you can help, $N.$B$BDeep in the Deadmines is a functional goblin shredder. Find that shredder and bring back the intact power supply. With the shredder's power supply, we can give our gyrodrillmatic excavationators the power they need to break through the rocky underground borders of Gnomeregan, opening the way for a gnomish assault!
Objective: Retrieve the Gnoam Sprecklesprocket from the Deadmines and return it to Shoni the Shilent in Stormwind.
