Title: The Tyrant King
Description: Spurred by their leader, the Gor'dosh may never leave us alone. The Tyrant King has gotten his name for being a rather intimidating brute who led the first attacks of ogres here. He is stubborn and doesn't even listen to the advice of his shamans or his wisest seers.$B$BIf we are to stop the Gor'dosh truly, this Tyrant King must be eradicated and killed. You will find him within the Gor'dosh heights, more than likely within their largest camp there. Venture forth, and make sure he can no longer cause us issues. Bring me the crooked crown he wears upon his head.
Objective: Slay the Tyrant King and bring his crown to Sergeant Blackwell in Caelan's Rest.
