Title: Webwood Egg
Description: Now that I have the spiders' venom, I'd like some live specimens to study.Unfortunately, capturing a living, giant spider is more than I can ask of you, young $c.And a giant spider is more than I could handle myself!$B$BBut if you can find an unhatched egg, then delivering specimens will be much easier, and I can then arrange for the unhatched spiders to be contained.$B$BThere must be a nest deep in the Shadowthread Cave.Please, search for an egg in the nest and return it to me.
Objective: Bring a Webwood Egg to Gilshalan in Aldrassil.
