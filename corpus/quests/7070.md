Title: Shadowshard Fragments
Description: I've recently begun testing various crystals and their arcane properties. Lady Proudmoore has given me leave to ask travelers heading into Desolace to seek out a place called Maraudon. Within the ruined temple are great elementals composed of purplish stones I've named shadowshards.$B$BIf you decide to head that direction and find some of the crystals, I would be very thankful. I could even fashion you a trinket from them if you so desired.
Objective: Collect 10 Shadowshard Fragments from Maraudon and return them to Archmage Tervosh in Theramore on the coast of Dustwallow Marsh.
