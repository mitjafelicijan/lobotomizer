Title: Return to Fel'Zerul
Description: Jammal'an the Prophet sentenced me to exile from The Temple of Atal'Hakkar. I once felt the high priest was a worthy leader.$b$bHis unyielding faith in his prophecy will bring about the destruction of the Atal'ai. If it hasn't already.$b$bWhen I expressed my concerns, I was labeled an infidel and ousted from the temple.$b$bThose artifacts you brought to me are harmless. But if Jammal'an has found the proper fetish enchantment for the summoning ritual, the world lies in great peril....
Objective: Return to Fel'Zerul in Stonard.
