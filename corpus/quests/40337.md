Title: We Must Have Rum
Description: We are running low on rum Cap'n! I need to test something, while I can brew beer in many ways I have yet to try to make some fine heavy rum.$B$BLuckily for us, we're on Jaguero Island, and as you could notice there are several gorillas here, where there's a gorilla there's also bananas. With the sugar the fruit holds I might be able to brew us some rum.$B$BA bunch of them would be great.
Objective: Bring 15 bananas to 'Ale Saint' Grida.
