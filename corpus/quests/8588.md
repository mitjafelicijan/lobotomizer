Title: The Horde Needs Heavy Leather!
Description: Since we're preparing for war, it might be best if we get all of the goods we need first, don't you think, mon? One of the staples of the war materiel that we're producing is heavy leather. We'll use it for just about everything, from reinforcement to armor, and good old plain tarps too.$B$BBut first we need to get our hands on more of it. That's your job, $c. Sharpen your knife and bring me back a bundle. Then we'll talk further.
Objective: Bring 10 Heavy Leather to Skinner Jamani at the Valley of Spirits in Orgrimmar.
