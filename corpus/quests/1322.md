Title: The Black Shield
Description: Hmmm, there's writing right here on the rim of the shield, but it's hard to read from all the burned stuff.$b$bI need acid to make it clear. Venom from the Darkfang spiders in the marsh would do good. Get me some of their sacs and I can clean this up.
Objective: Acquire 6 Acidic Venom Sacs for Do'gol in Brackenwall Village.
