Title: A Bloody Good Deed
Description: I am Kheyna Spinpistol. Mechanist, medic and killer of bad things.$B$BI am currently tracking a dangerous foe who threatens the lives of countless innocents. I might ask for your help in dealing with this later, but for now, I have another task for you and a generous reward if you do it well!$B$BThe nearby Kolkar tribe is preparing for a raid on the Crossroads. I know this because I've used one of my tools, and you could say I "sneaked" into their tent and heard their Khan ordering it. This can be avoided, however. You'll save many lives if you go down there and put an end to them all.$B$BThey can be found around the Oasis to the west. Once you're done, come back to me. If I am not here, simply touch the crystal again and I will know someone is waiting for me. Now get out there and KILL them all!
Objective: Kill 6 Kolkar Bloodchargers, 4 Kolkar Pack Runners and  4 Kolkar Marauders. Use the crystal to summon Kheyna Spinpistol again.
