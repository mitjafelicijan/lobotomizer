Title: The Maul'ogg Crisis V
Description: <The troll would listen to the story with interest, a small grin would mark from ear to ear with interest>. I could certainly do this, though I ask why to you, why would I? My magic is that of great power, and something I would not freely give to you.$B$BIf you desire my help then I would desire a favor. There is a satyr that I met quite some time ago, one who walks without care even to this day. He is a vile, trecherous snake of a creature who needs to be dealt with in a manner less then savory.$B$BLet us just say, his actions have wronged me greatly.$B$BTravel to Felwood, to the Ruins of Constellas, you will find Pethax Blackhorn there, it is his horn I desire from his battered corpse.
Objective: Obtain Pethax's Horn for Insom'ni on Kazon Island.
