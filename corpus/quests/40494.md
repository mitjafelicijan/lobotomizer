Title: The Firegut Task
Description: How disgusting.$B$BYou people dare call yourself the Horde, yet you know nothing about the Horde. We are the True Horde, the first and the very best.$B$BI see no thirst for battle in your eyes, I see no glory, I see nothing. You're nothing more than a worm living in the legend of the real Horde.$B$BYou are lucky I promised Karfang to indulge fools such as you. But if you truly want to not be a simple pest in the eyes of our clan you have to prove your skill as a warrior.$B$BUse whatever trickery you believe would aid you. I challenge you to take on the Firegut Ogres, slay them and prove yourself.$B$BNow go or forever be shamed for your utter powerlessness.
Objective: Slay 15 Firegut Ogres, 10 Firegut Ogre Mages, and 8 Firegut Brutes for Taskmaster Ok'gog at Karfang Hold in Burning Steppes.
