Title: An Offering for Kaneq'nuun
Description: Inunquaq has always been intrigued by the southlands, such a mysterious place, with many different peoples. In my long life, I have always wondered what lay beneath the shawl of wind and snow, perhaps you can tell me stories some time.$B$BIf you wish to truly be welcomed, you must make an offering to Kaneq'nuun. Many of our strong hunters have headed north to Tarq'un to search for larger beasts, and as a consequence, we have been rationing our food.$B$BAll along the coast are Ice Crawlers, they can be quite nasty if angered. Bring me 6 Ice Crawler Claws, they will go well with the food we have.
Objective: Gather 6 Ice Crawler Claws for Panukuki in Kaneq'nuun at Icepoint Rock.
