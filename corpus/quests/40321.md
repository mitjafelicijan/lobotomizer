Title: The Northeast Passage
Description: You have been incredibly helpful, and for that I am grateful. This land I have found myself on seems to be full of dangers, those that I am not ready to encounter just yet. I have done some repairs upon the canoe, and should be ready to set off soon, back to where I am from.$B$BThe Northeast Passage is quite trecherous, many jagged icebergs are out there which makes sailing quite difficult! I know a way through though, if you'd like to come with me, I need to be stopping at Kaneq'nuun, and I wouldn't mind showing you.$B$BWhen you're ready to go, let me know.
Objective: Speak with Inunquaq and travel through the Northeast Passage to Kaneq'nuun.
