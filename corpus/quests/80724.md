Title: Consulting an Expert
Description: I did perform a few precursory tests on the substance you have with you. All I have been able to discern is that the potion contains Peacebloom and Ghost Hair.$B$BBut that cannot answer for the catatonic state it forces upon undead.$B$BIt is my hypothesis that this concoction has been tampered with some manner of higher spellcraft, and that is beyond my abilities to solve.$B$BThere is only one who can give us the answers we need. He dwells at the centre of Brightwater Lake, east of Brill.$B$BApproach him with great reverence and measure your words accordingly.
Objective: Find Gunther Arcanus in Tirisfal Glades.
