Title: Smuggling Ale
Description: Hey, you! I be needing a bit of work that is off the boat if you think you can be a hand. When we get moving all that people really got to do is either drink, or work to keep the ship clean and orderly. I've found it always good to keep a good reserve of ale on hand, and a good variety of it too!$B$BWhat I'm gonna ask you to do is bring some ale from various sources, some of which might require you to have some friends, or connections with the opposite faction at that!$B$BFirst, I need a Barrel of Steamwheedle Wine, which can be found at the port, steal it. Secondly I'll need common ale, 10 Flasks of Port. Finally get me a Cask of Merlot from Stormwind at the Gallina Winery, and a jug of Orgrimmar Brown from the Tavern in Orgrimmar.
Objective: Gather a Barrel of Steamwheedle Wine, 10 Flasks of Port, a Cast of Merlot, and a Jug of Orgrimmar Brown for Fazzle 'The Slick' in Bloodsail Retreat.
