Title: Betrayal from Within
Description: Three of my tribe came out of the Kraul to lead the raids against the Horde, $r. <snort> They are ruthless and cunning, and if you defeat them, then your Crossroads and even most of the Barrens will learn peace... <snort> at least from the Razormane tribe. <snort>$B$BNak, Kuz, and Lok Orcbane are the ones you seek. They are far to the southof the Barrens. One is a spell caster, another a tracker, and their leader, the one called Orcbane, <snort> a warrior. Kill them, $r, like they have killed me.
Objective: Kill Nak, Kuz, and Lok Orcbane and bring their skulls to Mangletooth at Camp Taurajo in the Barrens.
