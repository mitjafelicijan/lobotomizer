Title: The Binding of Xanthar
Description: Some years ago, a rare and powerful item was stored inside of this church. I have been cursed to remain ever since its disappearance years ago. If you could recover this item and return it to Karazhan, I would be more than thankful.$B$BThe Binding was torn apart before it was ever stolen, both halves now rest with separate owners. The first was taken by a hermit mage who held no affiliations, his accent certainly sounded like he came from the north.$B$BThe second half of the binding was taken by a man of faith, of vigilance, wearing red cloth and bearing the symbol of the Light itself. His ravings almost sounded mad!$B$BGather me both the upper and lower half of the binding, and I can make it whole.
Objective: Gather the Upper Binding of Xanthar and the Lower Binding of Xanthar for Hanvar the Righteous in the small church outside of Karazhan.
