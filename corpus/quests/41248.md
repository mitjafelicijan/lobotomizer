Title: Naga All Along
Description: While you were away, my suspicions have been validated. There is a sundered ruin nearby where the naga seem to be conducting a ritual. This not only disrupts the peace of these lands but may lead to far graver consequences.$B$BBefore you journey into the ruins to confront their leaders, you must be prepared. The naga are formidable underwater foes, and you'll need a means to survive beneath the surface. I carry water-breathing potions, but their efficacy has been compromised due to the peculiar aura of this isle.$B$BI possess some knowledge of alchemy and can rectify the issue, but I require naga scales to do so. Bring them to me, and I shall provide you with these potions. However, exercise caution and avoid delving too deeply into the waters.
Objective: Bring 9 Reefscale Naga Scales to Sira Moonwarden.
