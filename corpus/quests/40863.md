Title: The Mercy of Humility
Description: Greetings, adventurer. I am Father Gavin, a humble priest of the Argent Dawn. I come to you with a request that weighs heavily upon my soul. I was recently ambushed in Dun Morogh and my prized possession, 'The Mercy of Humility', an old religious text, was taken from me by the violent Rockjaw Troggs. I fear for its safety, as these brutish creatures are known to destroy anything they can't use.$B$BI implore you to aid me in recovering this valuable relic. I am certain the Troggs near Ironband's Compound to the south east are those that possess it. Slay them and recover the text before it is damaged beyond repair.$B$BBring this book back to me, and I will make sure you are justly rewarded for your service to the Light.
Objective: Recover The Mercy of Humility from the Rockjaw Troggs near Ironband's Compound for Father Gavin in Dun Morogh.
