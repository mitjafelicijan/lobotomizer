Title: Necklace of Insomnius
Description: Insom'ni? Is that what he goes by now? I sensed a purpose within your mind as you approached me, and I wondered why it seemed so familiar. This necklace belongs to one named Insomnius, and no matter what he goes by he should remember the reasons of why he was exiled.$B$BRegardless, I promised that I would keep my word. Take this necklace to him, and tell him to not contact me again, for any reasoning. I say this with caution traveler, Insomnius was exiled from our kind for having ambitions that were beyond our tasks, and for dabbling in matters that were not his to interfere.
Objective: Return the necklace of Insomnius to Insom'ni on Kazon Island.
