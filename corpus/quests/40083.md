Title: The Rogue Heights
Description: When Lordaeron was on the brink of collapse, I found myself with a band of wandering wizards and footpads who had a knack for arcane magic. They called themselves the Rogue Wizards, and I met my end with them. Those I considered friends left me for dead without even attempting to help me as I lay trapped beneath a fallen tree.$B$BI desire to punish these people, and you will help me do as much! I have sensed for some time now a growing power lingering on the Rogue Heights.$B$BThey are no doubt plotting something, as I feel this arcane power has grown. We need to deal with them before they grow too strong to murder. You can find them just to the northeast of Glenshire. There is a small pathway through the Rogue Heights.$B$BTravel there and slay them for me.
Objective: Travel to the Rogue Heights and slay 6 Rogue Enforcers and 6 Rogue Conjurers for Harry Upperson in Glenshire.
