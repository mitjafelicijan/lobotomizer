Title: Reduced to Madness
Description: My people have been reduced to madness, insanity and a bloodlust for riddled fever dreams of nothingness.$B$BIt is like a shadow clouds their minds, and blocks all clarity from being perceived.$B$BDo you know the pain of not knowing those you once knew? To look upon the face of a friend and recognize nothing from them but utter savagery as if they were speaking a foreign language?$B$BMy kin are lost, and it hurts me greatly to admit that I no longer have a home within these forests. Something must be done to stop the madness, and to end it all.$B$BTravel to the Greenpaw Village just south of here, and rid my once home of the Foulweald Shamans that lurk there. They are nothing of what they once were, and perpetuate the horrors.
Objective: Travel to Greenpaw Village and slay 3 Foulweald Shamans.
