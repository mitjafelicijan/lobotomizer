Title: The Horde Needs Runecloth Bandages!
Description: It appears inevitable that the Horde and Alliance are on a collision course for war at Ahn'Qiraj. Surprisingly, it is not a war with each other, but rather with the silithid, and whatever force controls them. Also surprisingly, both sides are doing their part to gather the resources necessary to wage a successful war.$B$BI am collecting runecloth bandages to distribute to the soldiers, but I won't be successful without assistance, hopefully yours. Is this something that you can aid me with, $c?
Objective: Bring 20 Runecloth Bandages to Stoneguard Clayhoof at the Valley of Spirits in Orgrimmar.
