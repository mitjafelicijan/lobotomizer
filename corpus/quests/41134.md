Title: Training the Beast
Description: You can now tame every kind of beast you wish, but that's only the beginning of forming a bond with one. To do that, you have to learn how to train your new ally. Don't worry, I know just the guy who can help you: Marven. He resides in Stormwind, in the Park, but he will likely charge you an arm and a leg to teach you the ropes.$B$BThis Marven fellow is apparently an accomplished beast tamer, who's even impressed Nesingwary. Although I have no idea who that is either.
Objective: Speak with Marven the Tamer in the Park in Stormwind City.
