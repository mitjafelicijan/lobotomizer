Title: A Simple Memory
Description: I hear Sven has taken shelter in a shack close to the Raven Hill Cemetery. I fear he's filled with regrets and probably anger.$B$BConsidering we've found this shovel of his among the ruins of his lost home, maybe he would like to have it.$B$BPlease, be careful but be sure to bring the shovel back to its owner. He may be glad to see it, or he might just break it in half. Who knows. Thank you again, for all you've done.
Objective: Bring the shovel to Sven Yorgen.
