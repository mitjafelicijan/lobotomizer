Title: Ravencroft's Ambition
Description: I've been so consumed by this wretched research for far too long. Moranna isn't making it any easier on me either. I know that we must somehow uncover the secrets of Ur without his book, but how - how in the blazes can we even go about doing that?$B$BLast I heard, the Forsaken of the Horde claimed the book from the Silverlaine Keep - I fear it may be lost to us forevermore. However, I still have hopes. There was a girl in Shademore Inn who claimed to have escaped Gilneas City by leaping over its walls. My doubts aside, she actually sold me some useful information. It might well be that the library in Gilneas City holds a copy of the Book of Ur.$B$BI would greatly appreciate it if you could retrieve it for me.
Objective: Recover the Book of Ur : Volume Two from the library in Gilneas City and return to Ethan Ravencroft.
