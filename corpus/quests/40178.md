Aye, we'll poison the rum in the inn, wha' a damn shame, ain't it?$B$BBut sometimes ye gotta do wha' ye gotta do. Here's the poison, just toss it into the huge keg of rum they usually keep on the low level of the port, close to the auction house. They fill the rum everyday 'n they've got thar share already, they will only be feelin' it tomorrow.
