Title: Backup System Activation
Description: Gnomeregan's intricate network of ducts, pipes, channels, vents, and airways are essential for maintaining a healthy flow of air. However, they also circulated the toxic gases that had such a devastating impact on our brethren.$B$BAs a precaution, we established a comprehensive backup system that redirects the airflow in case of an emergency. Unfortunately, many of these channels have been closed off and sealed, necessitating the manipulation of levers and valves to reactivate them.$B$BWe require your technical expertise to access two crucial access points within the city. The first is the Alpha Channel, which is responsible for our backup power generation and is located in the Engineering Labs. The second is the Reserve Pump Channel, found near the Launch Bay, which is essential for the operation of our reserve air pumps.$B$BThese channels must be activated! We must return the great city of Gnomeregan to the marvel of technology that it once was!
Objective: Activate the Alpha Channel Valve and the Reserve Pump Channel Lever deep within Gnomeregan for Master Technician Wirespanner in Dun Morogh.
