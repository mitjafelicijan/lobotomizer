Title: Vilemusk Infiltration
Description: Nordrassil Glade has been a place of tranquility for many ages, but already agents of the legion have begun to spread their taint. Satyrs, traitors of a most disgusting kind have been probing at our borders.$B$BThey call themselves the 'Vilemusk' a name befitting of their illbegotten kin. I demand their presence removed from Hyjal, hunt them, and bring me their hooves as proof of your deeds. Do so, and you shall be rewarded.
Objective: Gather thirty Vilemusk Hooves for Arch Druid Dreamwind at Nordanaar in Hyjal.
