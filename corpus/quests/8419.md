Title: An Imp's Request
Description: $n, an imp in Felwood by the name of Impsy has requested your presence.It is somewhat strange, as he has asked that you bring a piece of felcloth as a sign of good faith.Considering the power you already wield as a warlock, I can only assume you know the satyrs of Felwood carry this felcloth.$b$bYou can find Impsy just north of the Bloodvenom Falls, which I've heard is quite lovely this time of year.
Objective: Bring a piece of felcloth to Impsy in Felwood.
