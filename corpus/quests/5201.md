Title: Winterfall Intrusion
Description: My presence goes unnoticed by most, $N. However, there is an annoyance that seems firmly rooted here in Winterspring: the Winterfall furbolg.$B$BAlthough I have never directly attacked the furbolg, they seem crazed, fearful of anything in their path. I have watched them slay countless creatures that had the misfortune to simply be in the wrong place at the wrong time.$B$BI am weary of their meddling -- please, help me by fighting back. Slay the furbolg and keep them away from Frostsaber Rock.
Objective: Rivern Frostwind wants you to slay 5 Winterfall Shaman and 5 Winterfall Ursa.
