Title: The Upper Binding III
Description: With the Elemental Fire, and the Fragment of Earth, we can ground the relic to prepare for real energization. This binding requires an extreme charge of ley-energy that could rival the power that it once held. To find such a collection of raw arcane power is rare on Azeroth.$B$BI have sensed an extreme amount of arcane discharge coming from the continent of Kalimdor for some time. With rumors I have heard, I can only deduce that the once elven city now called Dire Maul is discharging extreme energy.$B$BIt is here that I require a Supercharged Arcane Resonation, which should be found from any elements of arcane that have materialized there. Gather me one, and I will provide you with the relic as it once was.
Objective: Gather a Supercharged Arcane Resonation from the arcane elementals of Dire Maul for Parnabus in Gilneas.
