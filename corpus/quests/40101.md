Title: Original Owner
Description: Here is the deal, sweetcheeks. Once upon a time, not so long ago, a not-so-smart pirate by the name of Bannor thought he could double-cross me and get away with it.$B$BWell, you see, no one double-crosses me. So in exchange for me finding the location of your precious plates, I need you to end his miserable life and kindly retrieve my locket from his possession.$B$BHe has a camp on an island east of here, so that's most likely where you will find him. And don't worry, I will have what you seek by the time you return. So, do we have a deal?
Objective: Search island east of Booty Bay and retrieve Vess's locket from the pirate Bannor.
