Title: In Need of Sprugbolts
Description: Hey there! Good to have new blood around, especially with everything that has been going on lately. It feels like every project we've had has just been ground into the dirt, either from some outside force messing with us or, well, something breaking down!$B$BI'm sort of in charge of the supplies around here, and murlocs took a bunch of Sprugbolts a few weeks back. I want you to get them back for me. You can find those crafty murlocs in the waters all around us.$B$BBring me back 5 Sprugbolts. I hope you like swimming!
Objective: Bring 5 Sprugbolts to Jubie Gadgetspring at the Flaxwhisker Front.
