Title: Magical Maladies
Description: Hello, if it isn't the superhero themselves coming in to greet their old friend Wizette! I gotta say, you got a lot of goblins turning their heads wherever you're showing up. Our own personal celebrity, how charming.$B$BBut enough of that, we got work to do and I might need your assistance with something.$B$BGalvax up at the Water Hole ran into some renegade elementals that threaten our vital water supply and he can't handle it with the bruisers alone. Seems like these watery blobs don't fancy us taking all the water.$B$BI got a good hunch on how to deal with this from what he reported, I simply need a conduit of some sort. The Mudpaw Mystics to the northeast appear to carry magical orbs with them, bring me three, and we will continue with the plan.
Objective: Acquire three Mudpaw Oracle Orbs for Wizette Icewhistle at Rustgate Ridge.
