Others, however, eluded our grasp: The craven orcs of the Dragonmaw Clan, who brought us untold ruin astride their winged slave-beasts, took flight into the dark corners of the world.$B$BAll Kul Tiras craves vengeance against them, as it was by their fire that so many of our noble comrades faced agonizing deaths at sea.$B$BThe same fate was served to my own father, and I have not forgotten...$B$BIn the Wetlands, these Dragonmaw animals have had the gall to finally scurry out of their hiding holes. For this error, I will have their heads.$B$BDo this, and you will prove yourself a friend of Kul Tiras.
Objective: Bring 20 Dragonmaw Heads from Dragonmaw Orcs in the Wetlands to Lieutenant Alverold at Anchor's Edge in the Barrens.
