Title: The Horde Needs Wool Bandages!
Description: Greetings, $c. In preparation for the war at Ahn'Qiraj, I am here coordinating the Horde's efforts at gathering wool bandages. Unfortunately, out in the field, our soldiers cannot afford to rely upon the presence of a healer to keep them alive. Trust me, I know first hand. Thus, we're putting together all of these first aid kits for them.$B$BIf you have the time, I need many wool bandages. Return them to me here and I will see to it that you are properly rewarded.
Objective: Bring 20 Wool Bandages to Healer Longrunner at the Valley of Spirits in Orgrimmar.
