Description: The cloak is complete, $N. The time has come to find Volcor. I can only hope we are in time.$B$BThe cloak's magic, once invoked, will not last long; perhaps five minutes. It will be up to you to know when to use it: I would suggest waiting until you find Grimclaw.$B$BIf what he has told me is true, you will find his master in a cave south of here. Grimclaw will be alongside the road waiting for you. Signal to him by waving when you see him, and he'll point the way towards his master.
