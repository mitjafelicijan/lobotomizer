Description: Greetings! You look like a brave soul. What if I told you I am on the brink of revolutionizing travel as we know it?$B$BThrough some clever recombobulating of magic Runes that mages use I was able to make a device that can open a wormhole which can be used to teleport someone to a place on the other side of the world.$B$BBehold the invention that will change travel as we know it! I call it the Portable Wormhole Generator.$B$BNow the only thing left to do is to test it... That's where you come in.$B$BIf you are willing to step into the portal created by the Generator you should end up in the other side where my partner will be waiting for you. Do this and you will be given one of the devices as a show of our gratidude.$B$BGood luck!
Objective: Test Portable Wormhole Generator.
