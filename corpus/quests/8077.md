Title: Paragons of Power: The Demoniac's Robes
Description: The ultimate symbol of power amongst the tribe is the garb we wear in battle.  A demoniac's robes have fused fine runecloth and devastatingly powerful mojo into a single fabric.  The visage of the robe is said to instill fear into the minds of all who see it... especially the demons that the demoniac will eventually dominate.$B$BFrom Zul'Gurub, you must bring me a very specific set of the Paragons of Power.  It will be difficult... but your success will assure you of acquiring a robe for yourself.
Objective: Bring Al'tabim the All-Seeing a Primal Hakkari Kossack.  You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Revered with the Zandalar Tribe.$B$BAl'tabim the All-Seeing is located on Yojamba Isle, Stranglethorn Vale.
