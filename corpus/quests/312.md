Title: Tundra MacGrann's Stolen Stash
Description: I had a month's worth of dried meats salted and locked away for the cold season.Kept it locked so the bears wouldn't get it!But while I was off hunting deer, that beast, Old Icebeard, made off with the meat locker.He won't be able to smash through that Thorium though.But I'll starve if I can't get my meats back.$b$bYou seem a bit more stealthy than me.Perhaps you can retrieve my stash?I'll never make it in and out of that cave fast enough with this bum leg of mine.
Objective: Retrieve Tundra MacGrann's dried meats from the stolen meat locker in Old Icebeard's cave.
