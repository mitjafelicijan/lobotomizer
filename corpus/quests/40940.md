Title: Font of Arcana
Description: A strange and foul magic lingers upon the air of Gilneas. I believe there is more going on behind the scenes than first meets the eye.$B$BThe Lord Prestor was well known for holding the ear of King Greymane and often influenced many of his decisions. When I met this Lord Prestor long ago, I was overwhelmed by the immense magical aura that emanated from him. This same magic I can sense within Gilneas, but from where, I cannot be sure.$B$BTo discover the source, I require an item of some rarity: a Font of Arcana that is often wielded by Blue Dragonkin. The nearest of their brood resides within the Badlands, in a place named the Crystalline Oasis.
Objective: Travel to the Badlands and slay members of the Blue Dragonflight to recover a Font of Arcana for Magus Orelius at Ravenshire in Gilneas.
