Title: Restoring the Necklace
Description: You are going to need to find some "oomph" for the necklace, and Uldaman is probably the best place for it, actually.I guess there are a lot of constructs running around in there, yeah?Well, take out the biggest, baddest construct in that place and grab its power source!I am pretty sure I can fuse that source into the necklace.$B$BWithout that power source, fixing the necklace will be impossible.Come back to me here to Ironforge when you have it, and we'll get it all fixed up for you!
Objective: Obtain a power source from the most powerful construct you can find in Uldaman, and deliver it to Talvash del Kissel in Ironforge.
