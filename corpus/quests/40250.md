Title: Taming the Beast
Description: As you can see, hardly a living creature remains in these forsaken lands. Such as it is, your next task is to bring under your sway another victim of the Scourge plague. An undead pet is not so easily conquered, however.$B$BLordaeron once saw brown bears migrate from Silverpine in the summer, hiding in our forests and scavenging the farmer's crops. Those that remained during the plague are now here forever. Having broken the cycle of life and death like yourself, they are lost, confused, resentful.$B$BAs your skill grows, so too does that of your beasts. Yet for a creature no longer of the living, it will take great patience and dedication to reach deep into their wayward minds and find that lingering spark of intellect. Only then can you train it.$B$BThe bear is a strong companion who will stand between you and harm, ferociously keeping your foes at bay that you may shoot them where they stand. Find a Plagued Bear, awaken its mind, and bring it to me.
Objective: Use the Taming Rod to tame a Plagued Bear. Practice your skills, then return the Taming Rod to Liott Maneskin in Brill.
