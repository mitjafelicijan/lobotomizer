Title: The Dampening Mystery
Description: My studies have been ongoing for the last few months, and from what I can tell, the energy within the region has been slowly fading away. Even my own magic hasn't been as potent! If whatever is causing this can harness even more power, this could be quite damaging for magic across the entire continent, and potentially even Dalaran in the future!$B$BI have a few leads that I want to look into. The first is the ley-shards that occupy the once-great city of Eldarath. Just north of us is the ruins of the once-mighty city. Travel there and look for shards of its ley-energy. Gather five, and bring them to me for study, to see if their power has waned.
Objective: Gather 5 Eldarath Ley-shards and bring them to Magus Bromley.
