Title: Stewvul, Ex-B.F.F.
Description: If I am to translate anything, I will need my scrying goggles. Unfortunately, those were stolen quite some time ago by my ex-best friend forever, Stewvul. He broke my heart in five places and then left me here to rot.$B$BWith the help of my trusty crystal ball, I've isolated his whereabouts to either the Greymane Wall in Silverpine or what appears to be a portal world in the Outland that is currently being overrun by the Burning Legion. You're going to have to track him down and get my goggles back, $N!
Objective: Narain Soothfancy wants you to find his ex-best friend forever (BFF), Stewvul, and take back the scrying goggles that Stewvul stole from him.
