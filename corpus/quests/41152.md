Title: DV-500
Description: Now that you've been able to recover those defunct mainframes, I have a more important task to ask of you. My greatest creation, DV-500 has gone mad. It seems no matter what I have built, it is now turned against me.$B$BAs much as I love DV-500, there is something I love more. Gold.$B$BThe advanced processing unit cost me a fortune, and to see it wandering aimless for any sorry sap to go and repurpose is driving me mad! I need you to gather the processing unit from DV-500 and bring it to me immediately. I last saw him striding around to the north of here.
Objective: Recover the Advanced Processing Unit from DV-500 and return it to Balnack Copperlight at the Black Ash Coalpits on Blackstone Island.
