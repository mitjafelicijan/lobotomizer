Title: Rilli Greasygob
Description: Well, that didn't work.I put some extra gauges on the samophlange to measure its structural integrity, and they read the integrity at an all-time low.I could add some more dials and maybe a lever or two to try and fix it, but... I think that might make things even worse.$B$BYou should take the samophlange to Rilli Greasygob.He used to work for the Venture Company -- if anyone knows how to fix it, it's Rilli.$B$BYou can find him at Nogg's Machine Shop in Orgrimmar, in the Valley of Honor.
Objective: Bring the Broken and Battered Samophlange to Rilli Greasygob in Orgrimmar.
