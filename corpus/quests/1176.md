Title: Load Lightening
Description: When it comes to racing, every bit counts! Whether it's a minor tweaking on the power output, a slight slackening on the tension coils, or lightening the weight of the frame, you have to take everything into account.$b$bWe use vulture bones for a lot of the minor structural tweaks we make to our racers, which offer the perfect balance of strength and weight. Even better, it's easy for us to get more, as the salt flats are littered with vultures.$b$bBring me some and I'll give you a good price on them.
Objective: Get 10 Hollow Vulture Bones for Pozzik in the Shimmering Flats.
