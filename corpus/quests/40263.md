Title: A Demonstration of Skill
Description: The Dark Ranger, Lanissa, advised me to call on you specifically for a task after you'd finished your training. She and I agree that this will be a suitable demonstration of your skill and dedication to the Forsaken's cause.$B$BEven before the plague struck, our current mayor still presided over Brill. Boltrus was the mayor's assistant, a quiet yet competent man. He was sweet on one of the girls from the surrounding farms, and there were rumors about a clandestine rendezvous.$B$BAlas, touched by the plague and beyond the salvation of the Dark Lady, Boltrus haunts Tirisfal as a Scourge fiend. The mayor has asked that his suffering be put to an end. You can find him within the barn of the Balnir Farmstead. Perhaps he clings to memories of nights spent in that barn with her.$B$BFind Boltrus, end his suffering, and bring his remains back to Dark Ranger Lanissa. Perhaps then he can find peace. Your mercy will be rewarded.
Objective: Hunt Boltrus and bring his head back to Dark Ranger Lanissa in Brill.
