Title: A Broken Oath
Description: The Myrmidons of Rethress swore a sacred oath upon the stones of the Temple Rethress beneath the deep waves. Their word was their bond, but they broke the word of their sharp tongues and the oath they promised to keep. We were tasked with protecting Tide Mistress Rashal and carrying out her whims and deeds for the greater depths of all Naga.$B$BWhen the Spitelash were created, and the division began, all of the Myrmidons changed sides. They betrayed those loyal to the Rethress on orders from Naszharr and slew many of my most trusted brothers upon The Shattered Strand.$B$BI want them dead, interloper. I want their corpses to be feasted on by the depths. From their bodies, take their Myrmidon Signet'sâ€”a ring given to them upon swearing their oath.
Objective: Gather 20 Myrmidon Signets from Spitelash Myrmidon on the Shattered Strand.
