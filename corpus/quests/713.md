Title: Coolant Heads Prevail

That's not all: it also aids in retaining enchantments on magical items.$B$BI need a vial of it to increase the magical capacity of my shackles and make them powerful enough to stop our summoned friend from killing us all.$B$BBro'kin, a goblin friend of mine, can teach you to make it. He's in Alterac.
Objective: Find Frost Oil and bring it to Lotwil Veriatus in Badlands.
