Title: Tedious Diplomacy
Description: I'm more than certain this was meant to brew turmoil between us and Theramore, however I am not sure why. While you were out trying to figure out the shield part of the mystery, Kagoro has kept company with a scout from Theramore.$B$BI'll send you to meet with them, so Kagoro can share what information we gathered. For all that we know we're all simply trying to get to the bottom of this, without any more bloodshed between the factions.$B$BIf they sniffed around the inn, they probably know what killed their soldiers in self defence, when we were questioning Reethe. Or at the least, they are wondering what happened to them. We need to explain the situation, it is important.$B$B<Krog Grunts.$B$BAh, one more thing. Our goblin allies at Mudsprocket have sent me a message, they believe that the Black Dragonflight could have something to do with the burning of the inn. It makes sense, to be fair, we will check this later.
Objective: Meet with Kagoro on the road between Shady Rest Inn and Brackenwall Village in Dustwallow Marsh.
