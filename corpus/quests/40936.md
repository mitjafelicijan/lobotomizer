Title: Vagrant Supplies
Description: We arrived in Gilneas with the hope of being free from conflict. However, we have only come to find hostility.$B$BThree nights ago a worgen raid attacked our camp and made away with supplies most vital to us. However, these supplies were not taken by the pale Nighthowl, but instead the Bloodclaw. They are another tribe in conflict with the Nighthowl, who have a camp to the south of us. I have no doubt they have our supplies stashed amongst their hovels.$B$BRecover the supplies, and return them to us.
Objective: Recover the Vagrant Supplies from the Bloodclaw camp to the south and return to Camp Leader Gethenor at the Vagrant Camp in northern Gilneas.
