Title: Shadowguard
Description: Like many of our own priests, your own tribe puts you through rites of passage. These rites often teach priests special abilities that are vital to their survival. I sense that time is upon you even as we speak. You must return to the Valley of Spirits in Orgrimmar and speak to Ur'kyo. What he teaches you might be very important for the future.
Objective: Speak to Ur'kyo in Orgrimmar.
