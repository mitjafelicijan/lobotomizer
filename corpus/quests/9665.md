Title: Bolstering Our Defenses
Description: Agents of the Forsaken uncovered an Alliance plot to establish new bases here in the Eastern Plaguelands, at abandoned towers throughout the area.$b$bIt is imperative that we not allow them to establish a significant presence on our eastern borders, and so we must stave off this Alliance incursion. Our current plans are to drive them out of any towers they may have already seized, and occupy those that we have under our control against further attacks.
Objective: Capture Crown Guard Tower, Eastwall Tower, Northpass Tower and Plaguewood Tower in the Eastern Plaguelands, then return to Emmisary Gormok at Light's Hope Chapel.
