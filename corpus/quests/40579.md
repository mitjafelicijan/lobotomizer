Title: Memory of An Ogre
Description: I remember Do'gol speaking of a friend of his, a Tauren to be more precise. He said the Tauren befriended the ogres during the siege of Theramore, quite always mentioning how much of an unstoppable shield he was.$B$BI wonder, Do'gol, as many ogres, may be a bit slow, if we were to jog up his memory about this Tauren perhaps we can find out if the Tauren itself was the shield or that he carried a shield.$B$BI have this feeling $N.
Objective: Ask Do'gol in Brackenwall Village about the Tauren.
