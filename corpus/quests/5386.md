Title: Catch of the Day
Description: The smell of cooked fish has long been missing here at Ghost Walker Post. The trolls at Shadowprey Village are the best at catching fish... but alas, with all the centaur activities I have little time to make a journey to the trolls. Hrm...$B$BDo me a favor and journey to Shadowprey Village. Talk to the local fisherman Jinar'Zillen and bring me back my favorite, Bloodbelly fish. The road south of here will take you west to the troll village.
Objective: Talk to Jinar'Zillen at Shadowprey Village, and then bring Nataka Longhorn 2 Bloodbelly fish.
