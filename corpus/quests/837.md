Title: Encroachment
Description: When we arrived, the Razormane quilboars possessed much of the land, and proved a thorn in our sides. Through our efforts we have driven out the largest part of their numbers, but still they remain well-fortified in some areas.$b$bIt has gone on long enough, however. For our own protection, we cannot allow the Razormane any hold in our lands. Their camps can be found to the west of here. Look for the brambles and you will find them. Today we drive them from Durotar, tomorrow, perhaps from all of Kalimdor.
Objective: Kill 4 Razormane Quilboars, 4 Razormane Scouts, 4 Razormane Dustrunners and 4 Razormane Battleguards for Gar'Thok at Razor Hill.
