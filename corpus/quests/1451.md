Title: Rhapsody Shindigger
Description: Rhapsody took quite a liking to the booze. Now don't get me wrong -- all of us dwarves up here at the aviary love a good ale when the time is right.$b$bBut ol' Shindigger took to the liquor like a gryphon takes to the skies. And a damned shame it was, too. No one could fly like Rhapsody.$b$bFirst sign of trouble was when he came stumbling back from that mission with your buddy, Brohann. All went down hill quickly after that. Had to let him go.$b$bLast I heard, he's set up a brew camp to the east of here...
Objective: Seek out Rhapsody Shindigger in The Hinterlands.
