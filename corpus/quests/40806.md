Title: Kaldorei Relics
Description: <Her silver eyes grow wide, while her skin grows red. She grinds her teeth together and throws the letter to the floor.>$B$BSo that is the Elune-damned thanks I get after all this time? To take the fall for that belligerent, conniving druid? Oh, I will tell my sisters we will leave this place alright, don't expect to see us here again. And don't think I won't take this up with Lady Whisperwind either, she must smell foul play in the air. Now, get out of my sight, $n. You've done enough around here.
Objective: Return to Brolthan Ironglade for a reward.
