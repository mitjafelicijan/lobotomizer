Title: The Crescent Grove
Description: The Crescent Grove was once a retreat for druids of our kind for many years. As of recently, something evil has lurked there. Keeper Ranathos was tasked with holding back the taint that plagued the area, but we have not gotten word from him lately. His last message back was also quite erratic and unlike Ranathos. We druids had suspicions of something much darker taking root within the Crescent Grove.$B$BRecently, we have gotten a report from one of our druids being corrupted and warped. Arch Druid Staghelm has asked the druids to assist with establishing control in Crescent Grove once again, but we are unable to. Perhaps you can assist.$B$BYou can find the entrance to the grove in the south of Ashenvale, at the waterfall to the Mystral Lake. The cave's entrance lies above, so venture forth and destroy what evil lurks in that place. Make sure to bring assistance. You will find many hardships inside.
Objective: Destroy the source of corruption inside Crescent Grove and return to Denatharion in Teldrassil.
