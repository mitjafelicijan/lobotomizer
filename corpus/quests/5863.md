Title: The Dunemaul Compound
Description: Just recently, a large bank of nomadic ogres arrived in Tanaris. South of here, they have taken over a large area of the desert and formed a compound. Several smaller bands are currently wandering the desert, some of which have invaded the old troll ruins.$B$BThe Dunemaul Compound must be destroyed! We cannot allow these ogres to build up a force.$B$BThe leader of this band is named Gor'marok the Ravager; I believe that putting an end to his leadership will be the beginning of the end for the ogres.
Objective: Andi Lynn in Gadgetzan wants you to destroy the Dunemaul Compound by killing 10 Dunemaul Brutes, 10 Dunemaul Enforcers, and Gor'marok the Ravager.
