Title: Ashcovered Letter
Description: While you were getting your hands dirty, I got this letter from Rustgate Ridge. It's from Mayten Boomrifle, he's instructing the especially triggerhappy around here. You can get to Rustgate Ridge just to the east of here, up the hill. Follow the road and you'll find it. Take the letter and talk to him once you have the time. Hah, what am I saying - as if you'd ever have time. Now get back to work!
Objective: Bring the Ashcovered Letter to Grizzie the Enforcer at Rustgate Ridge just up the hill to the east.
