Title: Report from Burnside
Description: Nethergarde is an isolated, and rather desolate place. We rely on a large garrison to help stem the tide of a potential demonic invasion, should such an occasion ever occur.$B$BThe soldiers under my command have homes and families, and morale here is paramount. I rely on my sergeants to give me a situation report on the status of those beneath me.$B$BAs of current the only one I am waiting from is from Sergeant Burnside, would you do me a favor, and collect it from him? You can find him somewhere outside the gate, he is probably with his troops.
Objective: Find Sergeant Burnside and collect his report, deliver the Report from Burnside to Commander Baelos at Nethergarde Keep.
