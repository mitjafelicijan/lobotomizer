Title: Azotha Gold
Description: Ten thousand years ago, the Zandalari were competing against a civilization known as the Azotha. Their struggle was put at an end when the world was shattered, and oceans swallowed a large chunk of the ancestral landmass. Tel'Abim just happens to be a region where the two clashed.$B$BThe Trolls seem to have lost the skirmish referenced on this tablet, and it mentions Trolls being sacrificed to the gods at the ritual site, their riches buried. This means there could be GOLD buried under this ritual site! And we may even have found it.$B$BHead to the western-most isle of the Jagged isles and search for an obvious ritual site, when you find it, start digging!
Objective: Dig around the ritual site and find the Azotha Ritual Cache for Archaeologist Trixia Goldspark at Tel Co. Basecamp in Tel'Abim.
