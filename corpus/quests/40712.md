Title: In Your Own Defense
Description: Well met, you that wanders the lands of my ancestors. As the last keeper of this temple, I welcome you to the temple of Zeth.$B$BBehold the flame of kings, stranger. Gaze into it, perhaps it will tell you of the future as it told me of this day, for I was one of the few to keep their sanity only to wait for this day to come. Understand me, stranger, I do not know your name, and even with sight beyond sight before me stands exactly what you see when you look at me. A ghostly figure with no shape whatsoever, and yet, the fire spoke so many moons ago. Be it fates hand or simple coincidence, you were sent to aid me, and you will do so, either by the kindness of your heart or simple curiosity.$B$BThe curse of Zetharia still haunts Corthan, as we speak the spirits are getting ready to strike you, as they do not see you for who you are but a memory of an enemy which has passed a long time ago. If we are to continue our discussion you must make sure to dismiss them.
Objective: Gather 3 Ancient Dust for the Forgotten Keeper at the Ruins of Zeth in Badlands.
