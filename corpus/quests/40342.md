Title: The Bronze Betrayal
Description: Long ago I was tasked with the defence of the time ways, me and another took our oaths together. I dare not speak their name, for they are a traitor to the Bronze Dragonflight, and now consort with the Infinite. They work against everything they vowed to upkeep, and are actively destroying all of our work.$B$BThey go by the name Chronar, a twisted husk of what they once used to be. Prided by the values of our kin, and our honor, but no longer.$B$BVenture into the Black Morass, and find Chronar, bring me his vile head as proof, and I shall reward you with a gift most precious to me.
Objective: Slay Chronar, and bring his head to Tyvadrius in the Caverns of Time.
