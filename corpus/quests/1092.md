Title: Gerenzo's Orders
Description: I guess I'd better think about getting out of here, also. It won't take long for word of what happened here to spread to the higher ups, and I'm sure they wouldn't take too kindly to meeting me again.$b$bI'll sneak out and meet with Ziz. Hopefully, he'll be able to find me a new job!$b$bI'll try and clean up this mess a little, but you should take the ore sample to Ziz right away. He told me that he'd set up camp somewhere on the western side of Windshear Crag. Good luck.
Objective: Deliver the Unidentified Ore to Ziz Fizziks in the Stonetalon Mountains.
