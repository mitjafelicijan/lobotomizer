Title: Yet Another Smoke Cloud Above Orgrimmar
Description: Enjoying yourself, boss?$B$BGood, good. Now, you see, that was a free trial. Doesn't really matter to me if you won or not, but I did say â€˜coin connoisseurs', so you really gotta pay a membership fee.$B$BHey, hey, where're you goin' man? Come on, don't be like that. I might be willing to give you a membership card if you repay me with some favors.$B$BSee, I ordered some new goods from the Undermine for our hookahs. This cargo is very important and valuable. I will throw in some coins, too, which you are more than welcome to keep spending in my bar, if you go and fetch my goods for me. Now, the cargo should arrive at Ratchet right around today, so if you'd get a move on, I'd really appreciate it.
Objective: Speak to Innkeeper Wiley about Quark's cargo.
