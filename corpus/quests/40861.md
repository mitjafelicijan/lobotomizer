Title: High Energy Regulator
Description: The destruction of Gnomeregan set us back in our technology in quite a few ways. So much of our work was lost in the blink of an eye.$B$BWe are basically working blind. If we are to ever make real progress here in this facility, then we require a very rare item of significant importance.$B$BThe High Energy Regulator is something that was created to manage surges of intense energy. Without it, it is impossible to channel excessive amounts of power to where we need it, which is exactly what we are trying to do here!$B$BCurrently, this facility is operating at low power to prevent an override or oversurge to our systems. But we can work faster, MUCH faster. I need you to find the schematic for the High Energy Regulator that was lost in Gnomeregan. We can truly utilize this facility in the way it was meant to run if we can get ahold of it.
Objective: Find the Schematic: High Energy Regulator within Gnomeregan and bring it to Weezan Littlegear at the Gnomeregan Reclamation Facility in Dun Morogh.
