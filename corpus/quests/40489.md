If you are interested, I would suggest bringing fellow adventurers, a group of mercenaries, or some kind of brigade.$B$BIf you end up completing the task, return to Magni himself, and he will reward you.
Objective: Venture into The Hateforge Quarry and remove the presence of the Twilight Hammer from deep within, when completed, return to King Magni Bronzebeard in Ironforge.
