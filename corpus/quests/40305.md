Title: The Depths of Karazhan II
Description: With the Pendant of Ardan in our hands we can turn our attention to the tower itself, and what magic has begun to raise more ghosts around it. As of recently, the dead have begun to materialize, spirits and echoes of the past clinging around the tower as if they were still alive.$B$BTravel to the ruins around Karazhan, and from the ghosts and dead bring me 8 Ghostly Substance. It is from this substance I will be able to check what magic lingers upon the ethereal beings.$B$BBe careful, for there are also rumors of a Dark Reaver who guards the entrance to Karazhan.
Objective: Gather 8 Ghostly Substance from the ghosts around Karazhan, and return to Kor'gan at Stonard.
