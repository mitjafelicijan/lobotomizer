Title: Korrak the Everliving
Description: There's something not quite right about all of this... Did anybody think to burn Korrak's corpse? Those trolls will stop at nothing to revive their fallen leader - as blue skinned pagan man-beasts often do.$B$BJust keep your eyes out, $N. Don't be alarmed if Korrak makes a surprise appearance; and if he does, I want him executed - his corpse burned to ashes.$B$BFor good measure, lop off his head and bring me his skull before you ignite the lifeless mass.
Objective: Should Korrak the Bloodrager make a return to the Snowfall Graveyard, seek him out and destroy him.$B$BReturn the Skull of Korrak to Lieutenant Haggerdin in the Hillsbrad Foothills.
