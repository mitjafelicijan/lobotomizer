Title: The Shield's Owner
Description: I had a talk with one of our scouts. He is, well, responsible for spying on Camp Taurajo, deep in the barrens. And he is certain, and I believe him, that no Taurajo tauren ever wielded this shield.$B$BI tell you about this, because if it was really of Tauren craftsmanship, then the owner of the shield  must've lived in the swamp for some time.$B$BI sent our infiltrators to check upon the Brackenwall Village, the horde outpost here for any sign of Taurens. While they are on their mission, I have a request. Gather intel from our watchtowers in the marsh. Maybe our soldiers remember something remarkable.
Objective: Gather information from the nearby watchtowers and return to Captain Garran Vimes in Thermore.
