Description: The worgen of Gilneas are surprisingly well organized for a bunch of beasts. Their packs have caused us quite a lot of headache in spreading our influence.$B$BI am in need of someone who can sever the chain of command. An aimless group of worgen will serve us much better in the end. Travel west and search for the cavern where the Bloodclaw alpha call home. Slay them so that their packs cannot organize against us.
Objective: Slay 9 Bloodclaw Alpha for Deathstalker Vernon at Stillward Church in Gilneas.
