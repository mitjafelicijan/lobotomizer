Title: Last of the Living Dead
Description: Greymane may have thought himself safe behind these walls, but he was foolish to believe he could hide from Death. Now, his incompetence comes back to haunt him, and by extension, me.

It is time to take matters into our own hands.$B$BI command you to eliminate the remaining Scourge forces in Greyshire.$B$BDo not fail me, for failure is not an option.$B$B<The Forsaken's eyes narrow with a cold, calculating intensity.>
