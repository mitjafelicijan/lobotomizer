Title: Wild Leather Vest
Description: Wild Leather vests are the staple of any Wild Leather armor set.The frame of the vest and the wildvine weave within it produces a product that offers maximum protection of the torso while allowing for potent magic to work its way through the garment.$B$BFor this pattern, I will require two Turtle Scale breastplates, two sets of Turtle Scale gloves, and a wildvine.This is not an easy lesson, but it is one you certainly have the skill to complete.
Objective: Bring 2 Turtle Scale Breastplates, 2 Turtle Scale Gloves, and a Wildvine to Jangdor Swiftstrider in Camp Mojache.
