Title: To Find the Heart
Description: We have allowed this poor soul to rest at the roots of the Sleeping Tree. While it will not heal them, it will stop the effects of withering, at least for now. As guardians of these lands, all life here is valuable and must be nurtured by us.$B$BHowever, you were not sent here to learn of our values. I know what the Highborne wants, and while I am not sure it will work, my sisters and I will do our best to aid. Gather a few leaves from the bushes and the heart of a hawkstrider. It pains me to have you send and do this, but sometimes, to receive something, you must offer something in return.
Objective: Gather the necessary ingredients for Rine.
