Title: Misgotten Honor
Description: Well, this is a little embarrasing, it seems my embellishments might have gotten to the wrong hands and led before me.$B$BI've always wanted to be more of a success in my brother's eyes, and whilst he has made a good living as a trader, I've served Orgrimmar for years only to remain a Grunt.$B$B<Zuul sighs.>$B$BI suppose I should come clean, it is honor that dictates I be honest, especially with those of my own kin.$B$BLying to try and make appearances is what Alliance diplomat's would do, not the sons of Durotar.$B$BAs much as I desire to go and apologize in person, I cannot. I have too many tasks to do in such a short time.$B$BSpeak to my commander and let him know I desire leave to Durotar for a short time.
Objective: Speak to Dispatch Commander Ruag in the Stonard Keep.
