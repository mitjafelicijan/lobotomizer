If it were up to me, I'd just let the pathetic humans and Scourge fight it out.They seem bent on killing each other as is.$b$bAlas, our Dark Lady wants to help speed up the process a tad so why not pass these morbid days by spreading a little death and disease across the land?$b$bHere's the plan, $N: you go out to Nethander Stead, south of Tarren Mill and east of the river and Southshore. Collect for me 6 Mudsnout Blossoms from the field for my next elixir.
