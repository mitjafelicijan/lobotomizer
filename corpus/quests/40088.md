Title: Head of the Pack
Description: With their forces at the tower weakened, it is time for us to kill their leader. Yes, when I say us, I mean you. Their leader recently invaded the mine, and he took his bigger worgen down there with him. The Gracestone mine is a top priority. Without its resources, Glenshire doesn't stand a chance against the humans, not to mention that the mines provide a perfect ambush point for worgen to attack any travelers between Silverpine and the Uplands.$B$BGo down there and bring me the head of their leader. Oh, and feel free to kill as many of his followers as you can.
Objective: Bring the head of the Pack Leader Sharn and slay 5 Tirisclaw Ambushers and 4 Tirisclaw Scavengers before returning to Volgrin.
