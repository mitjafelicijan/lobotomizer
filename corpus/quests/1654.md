Title: The Test of Righteousness
Description: I'd like to reward you if you'd be willing to accept such a thing? Don't misunderstand me, my generosity is dependent on how much help you can be, but I see us both benefiting greatly from such an alliance.$B$BI will craft for you a weapon worthy of what you've accomplished, a symbol of paladinhood and the Light, but you must gather the items I need to craft it. I've already started taking notes on the items, it just requires someone brave and skilled enough to recover them. What do you say, $c?
Objective: Using Jordan's Weapon Notes, find some Whitestone Oak Lumber, Bailor's Refined Ore Shipment, Jordan's Smithing Hammer, and a Kor Gem, and return them to Jordan Stilwell in Ironforge.
