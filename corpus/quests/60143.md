Title: Brannol's Sewing Kit
Description: Have you ever stood at the edge of Teldrassil and looked out over the Veiled Sea? It's a magnificent sight, $N. I cannot recommend enough that you experience it at least once.$B$BI often travel with my sewing kit to the waterfalls near Wellspring Lake, right as they pour over the side of the trunk. It is a wonderfully serene spot where I may work in peace. The last time I was there, however, I was attacked by maddened timberlings and fled without my kit!$B$BThose tools have been with me for as long as I can remember, and I can't bear the thought of them tumbling over into the sea, lost forever. Would you kindly recover my kit for me, $N?
Objective: Recover Brannol's Sewing Kit and return it to him in Dolanaar.
