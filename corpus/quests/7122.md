Description: The mines in Alterac Valley hold more than just minerals.Both the Frostwolf and Stormpike have cached excess supplies in the Irondeep and Coldtooth mines... that's not a bad idea, if we could only maintain control of them!$B$BCapture a mine, then return to me.To capture a mine, enter one that we do not control and kill its leader.When you do that, the mine will be ours, and we'll send troops to protect it!
Objective: Capture a mine that the Stormpike does not control, then return to Sergeant Durgen Stormpike in the Alterac Mountains.
