Title: Killing the Tide Lord
Description: There is one thing left for you to do, outsider, if you truly wish to assist the Rethress. The one who claimed dominion over these lands and betrayed me is Tide Lord Naszharr. He is a vile traitor who must be vanquished from this world.$B$BI want him to sufferâ€”and suffer greatly. He resides near the Ravencrest Monument up to the northeast. Go there and rip the heart from him, then bring it to me. Make sure he regrets everything he has done to us.
Objective: Bring the Heart of Naszharr to Tide Mistress Rashal.
