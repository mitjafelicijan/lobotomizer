Title: Scalding Mornbrew Delivery
Description: Gah!I was supposed to get this delicious scalding mornbrew to Durnan Furcutter inside Anvilmar a while ago now, but I had to deliver one to Grelin here first.I'll never make it to Anvilmar before the brew runs cold!$B$BYou look fast.Maybe you can make it.This cup will only stay hot for five more minutes, and Durnan didn't order "chilly" mornbrew, so get going.Anvilmar is to the northeast, a settlement dug into the mountain.$B$BThanks, $N, and don't forget to bring me back my mug!
Objective: Take a Scalding Mornbrew to Durnan Furcutter inside Anvilmar before it gets cold in five minutes!
