Title: The Sputtervalve Conductor
Description: My beauty, trapped in a sea of vultures.$B$BI am a brave dwarf, but if I ever want to fly again, I can't go risking my life now, can I?$B$BYou look like someone who knows a thing or two about slaying vultures, and Sputtervalve Conductors. The eyes of Harlek can spot talent when he see's it!$B$BMy flying machine is down below, I was doing some repairs before me and farmer Segwar were attacked you see? Sadly I left behind the Sputtervalve Conductor, a rather valuable part that I was trying to get fixed to do some scouting in the perimeter.$B$BI need you to go down to the flight pad, and go get the part for me, do that, and I'll give you a nice drink of ale, good?
Objective: Collect the Sputtervalve Conductor for Harlek Vaultshield at Bael Hardul in Stonetalon Mountains.
