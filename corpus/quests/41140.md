Title: Proving A Point
Description: Me good-for-nothing brother Sindri over there thinks he can one up me by makin' empty promises to mother - just te stick it up te the ole kvinn! He damn well know's it is ME who's the better smith 'ere. Just ye wait, brother, I'll smith yer a weapon ye can stick up yer gryphon roost! Ye will help me with that, stranger.$B$BYe know the cave at Skulk Rock? The mine still has lots o' mithril in it, but I don't need any ole stinkin' mithril - no, I need etched mithril! Those sludge buggers roamin' there absorb all ore shards lyin' around, but their acid ain't strong enough to destroy it completely. If ye melt it, it becomes incredibly sturdy!$B$BSindri might tell ye he read in some ole dusty, crusty book that it won't work, but do ye think me ancestors were readin' books before swinging their hammer? Ye can bet your arse on it, they didn't!
Objective: Gather 15 Etched Mithril Shards for Brok Thunderforge in Aerie Peak for his new creation.
