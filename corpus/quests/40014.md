Title: Titiki's Hunt
Description: The trolls were once known far and wide as the greatest hunters on Azeroth and some of those legends have persisted until today. There is time to hunt for sport and time to prepare, and as much as I would love to put you to the challenge there's the problem of the Witherbark.$B$BPaying homage to Shadra in their attack, they fell upon us with poisons almost like the days of old. This time we will be prepared. Head into the heart of the Arathi Highlands and hunt Giant Plains Creepers for their venom sacs.$B$BOnce you have enough for several anti-venoms, return to me and we can see if there are more preparations to be made.
Objective: Slay Giant Plains Creeper for 5 Greater Venom Sacs.
