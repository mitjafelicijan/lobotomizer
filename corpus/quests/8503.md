Title: The Alliance Needs Stranglekelp!
Description: So, $c, did I already tell you about all of the fabulous uses stranglekelp has? I did? Oh well... in any case we need a lot of it, and when I say a lot, I mean A LOT! Do you think that you could help us out? I know that it means going without all of those wonderful things that you can make with it, but it's for a good cause!
Objective: Bring 20 Stranglekelp to Private Draxlegauge at the Military Ward in Ironforge.
