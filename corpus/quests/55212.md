Title: Tinkering Away
Description: Back during the third war I was renowned engineer. I did field repairs on flying machines, and all other contraptions. Some say that these inventions are simply gnomish in design, but blast 'em!$B$BI always put my own twists on them for extra sturdiness and to be able to handle a dwarf!$B$BI'm one of the big engineers here in Hawk's Vigil, but I'm sort of running low on supplies to tinker with. I know those fellows up the cliff from here at the Ironforge Airport have tons just laying around.$B$BHead up there, and find my friend Orion Coalborn. He should have some extra supplies he'd be willing to give me!
Objective: Head to the Ironforge Airfields and gather Barthos Thundercrank's supplies.
