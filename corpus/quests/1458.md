Title: Reagents for Reclaimers Inc.
Description: One of my tasks out here involves picking up some reagents for Leftwitch, a gnome mage in Kharanos . Roetten seems to think it's easy coin in the bank since we're out here already. He doesn't really care that we're short-handed as is.$B$BThe first few items on his list should be easy enough to get, and it'd be a good chunk of coin for anyone helping me out.$B$BI need some horns and claws from the Hatefury satyr to the east of here. Bring 'em back to me and we'll get started on the rest of the list.
Objective: Bring 10 Hatefury Claws, and 10 Hatefury Horns to Kreldig Ungor in Desolace.
