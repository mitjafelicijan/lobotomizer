Title: The Orb of Kaladus
Description: I would ask one last thing from you, my mentor came from Lordaeron, a kingdom far to the north that is now desecrated and torn beyond imagining. It is filled with the undead that roam freely upon the broken landscape.$B$BWithin this land is an order known as the Scarlet Crusade, remnants of an old paladin order. They are fanatical, and heartless to the core, it is from them I require something.$B$BWithin the Scarlet Monastery, in northern Tirisfal Glades is a mighty Cathedral, it was built well before these zealots time, and it is there my mentor studied the light.$B$BI would ask that you bring to me the Orb of Kaladus, a stone enfused with the power of the light. Ever since my mentor departed from Lordaeron, those holy brigands have kept it to themselves.$B$BEnter the Cathedral, and bring it to me, the light should be wielded by the true of heart, not the black of soul.
Objective: Venture within the Scarlet Monastery and find the Orb of Kaladus, retrieve it, and return to Watch Paladin Janathos at Sorrowguard Keep.
