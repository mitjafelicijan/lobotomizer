Title: Plain Letter
Description: I sense anger burning inside you. Your arms tremble and shake, but not in fear, rather at the rage you are attempting to restrain. Such moments are when we should place our hope in warriors such as yourself, ones undaunted despite adversity.$B$BYou who have not benefitted from the arcane, never even dreamed of wielding a weapon before the fall of Quel'Thalas. You who had nothing and still lost everything. That fire in your eyes reminds me of Valanos', the one who instructed me to provide you with this letter.
Objective: Speak to Valanos Dawnfire in Brinthillien.
