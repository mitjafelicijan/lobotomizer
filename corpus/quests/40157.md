Title: Hazzuri Dark Vessels
Description: We come from the great city of Zul'Hazu to the southwest. It is where our ancestors called home. Though now, we are nothing more than outcasts. Our people have turned away from the roots of our past. They are swayed by great shadowy magic that taints their minds and twists them to madness. We primalists have lost our way in the past. With whispering shadows and great magic to wield, Chieftain Woh'zo chose the darkness over our heritage.$B$BOur people may have turned their backs on us, but perhaps there may be a chance to save them. All across the city are Hazzuri Dark Vessels. They hide away in small baskets and pouches around the city. These Dark Vessels are used in ceremonies and rituals, and they contain shadowy energies that twist minds.$B$BGo into Zul'Hazu and get me these Dark Vessels, but be careful, mon. They won't let you in, and they won't just let you leave.
Objective: Gather 8 Hazzuri Dark Vessels and bring them to Primalist Jongi in the Hazzuri Glade.
