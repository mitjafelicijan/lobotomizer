Title: The Swarm Grows
Description: Hmm. Seems Belgrom thinks those monsters are a threat. He wants them pushed back into whatever depths they crawled up out of.$B$BI guess killing the dwarves sent by the Explorers' League wasn't enough--now I have to send a half-dead war party into another battle. We won't be able to do it ourselves; not while we're in this condition. The dig site's to the south of here. There shouldn't be anymore dwarves to deal with. Feel up to wielding a blade or staff and doing your part to aid us?
Objective: Kill 5 Silithid Searchers, 5 Silithid Hive Drones, and 5 Silithid Invaders and return to Moktar Krin in Thousand Needles.
