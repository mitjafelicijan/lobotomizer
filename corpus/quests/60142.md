Title: A Change Of Heart
Description: Pardon me $c, might I ask a favor of you? I'm sure my association with Grimrizz and his dark rituals does little to put you at ease, but I assure you I'm no power-thirsty demon-dabbler! This doesn't suit me...$B$BTruth be told, I always wanted to be a blacksmith. No, not an engineer. Not all gnomes are engineers, you know! From the moment I laid eyes on the Great Forge, I've dreamed of working beside the great Tormus Deepforge.$B$BThe suffocating heat of the forge's flames, the shrill cry of hammers striking hot iron, the glint of a finely crafted blade. Yes, nothing would make me happier!$B$BIf you're headed to Ironforge, won't you please take this letter to Tormus Deepforge for me? It's an application to join the Blacksmith Guild in Ironforge. Tormus should be near the Great Forge.
Objective: Bring Tog's Letter to Tormus Deepforge at the Great Forge in Ironforge.
