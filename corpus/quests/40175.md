Title: The Bet
Description: I may not have the most gold on me, but I do have a fortune that's waiting out there for me. I made a bet with this goblin, named Nagzel, crafty little guy. You see, we were playing cards one day and he was telling me about his plans of joinin' the Venture Co. and working at the base camp by Lake Nazferiti. For the first time in my life, I was actually winnin', and he offered this big hunk of a ring.$B$BNow, the ring itself I cared little for, it was nothing more then some cheap old iron lug nut, but it had this BIG jade sticking on top of it. I'm talking the size of my thumb!$B$BBets are more then just games, they're a way of life, and this man took the ring when he lost, and vanished, never to be seen again. Go find this punk and get that green stone, it's rightfully mine!
Objective: Bring back the "Rightful" Jade for Dirty Jacob.
