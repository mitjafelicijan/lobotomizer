Title: Paragons of Power: The Predator's Mantle
Description: We Zandalar prize what we wear as a symbol of accomplishment.  You don't need to be able to see what one wears to be able to sense what emanates from it - power transcends sight.  The garments of the Zandalar predator are like this, and most cherished by them is the mantle they wear.  It helps to obfuscate them from view... and to make their presence known when they wish it.$B$BThe Paragons of Power await your retrieval in Zul'Gurub.  Bring me what I seek, and the predator's mantle shall be yours.
Objective: Bring the following Paragons of Power from Zul'Gurub to Falthir the Sightless: A Primal Hakkari Aegis.  You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Revered with the Zandalar Tribe.$B$BFalthir the Sightless is located on Yojamba Isle, Stranglethorn Vale.
