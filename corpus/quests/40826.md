Title: The Key to Karazhan VII
Description: Regrettably, my knowledge of the whereabouts of Medivh's Echoes is limited. To begin your search, I suggest visiting the locations that Medivh frequented during his second life, when he returned to redeem himself and prepare for the impending Third War. These events are relatively recent, so the Echoes should be easier to locate and more potent.$B$BIt is likely that the Echoes of Medivh's presence will be accompanied by objects that once belonged to him. Perhaps a stray feather from his cloak, or some other memento that carries his essence.$B$BHowever, time is of the essence, and you must act quickly. Go forth and begin your search for at least four of his Echoes. I believe this should be enough to recharge the key and unlock the chambers of Karazhan.
Objective: Find four Echoes of Medivh. They might be found in places of great significance for the mage. Then return to Vandol with the key.
