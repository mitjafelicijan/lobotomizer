Title: The Scourge Cauldrons
Description: Within the lands of former Lordaeron are eight cauldrons - four in the west, and four more entrenched in the east.These cauldrons spew poisons into the air, propagating the plague throughout the land for the Scourge.$B$BThe necromantic might of Kel'Thuzad is too strong to outright shut down these cauldrons, but we think we might have a way to subvert them to our advantage.My second, Shadow Priestess Vandis, will be your point on this assignment; she'll continue the briefing from here.
Objective: Speak with Shadow Priestess Vandis at the Bulwark, Western Plaguelands.
