Title: The Foul Stench of the Scarlet Crusade
Description: After leaving behind my mortal shell the Light has shown me many different things.$BMy life,  my mission, my future.$BAll I wish now is to end the Scarlet Crusade.$BBridgette Abbendis has retreated to the Scarlet Monastery. She ordered the recruitment of more men and devised a new concoction that'd instantly put an end to the undead.$BIt seems her plans were not effective since the day she decide to hide in her chambers to meditate. The Light has its own paths you see, mysterious to us. She was to harbor more power for a purpose that is nothing else but foolish. East of Tyr's Hand the Scarlet Crusade prepares for a trip North, waiting for their leader to return so they can commence.$BBut against their own odds, a dark power infiltrated the Monastery during her meditation and has forever tormented the already fanatical minds.$BThey can longer see any difference between the living and the undead. Their use of shadow magic comes from a different power, one that could equal the Light itself.$BIt's time to decide whether you are ready to prove your own mettle.$BNaxxramas was a threat indeed, but the powers at play here can very well surpass it. Are you ready $N?
Objective: Speak to the Spirit of Alexandros Mograine.
