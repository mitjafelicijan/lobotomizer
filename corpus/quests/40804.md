Title: Victory, Such as it is
Description: Your task for helping Forest Song and ending this stalemate is at an end. However, I cannot think of anyone more appropriate to send word to Fandral Staghelm than you, $n. You did a significant portion of the work, and you deserve that portion of the praise too.$B$BGo, now. The path to Teldrassil is a long, albeit beautiful, one. Take the time for some rest and relaxation, perhaps, enjoy the verdant canopies of our ancient oaks. Once you board the ship and make it to Teldrassil, you will find the Arch Druid in the Cenarion Enclave of our beautiful capital. Here, this report should explain what transpired. Give it to him, but be a bit wary of his temper.
Objective: Take the Sealed Forest Song Report to Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm in Darnassus.
