Title: The Tome of Divinity
Description: My wife and I run an orphanage in Stormwind, mostly for children who have lost parents due to the attacks by the Scourge in the last decade. I come to Ironforge every month or so to see about collecting more supplies from the citizens here, and talk to the various groups to see if they can do anything to help.$B$BThis trip's been agonizingly slow, and not very productive.$B$BIf I could just get some more linen for my wife to make some clothes, I could finally send a shipment home.
Objective: Bring 10 Linen Cloth to John Turner in Ironforge.
