Title: Further Instructions
Description: The matter of this gnome that has been hired by the Venture Company has caused a bit of a stir in Undermine. The trade princes do not approve of Razdunk's consorting with this Gerenzo.$b$bRiddlevox has asked me to take care of the problem, and I'm sure he was instructed to do so by one or more of the trade princes. Of course, the Director didn't tell me that. Let's just say I have a hunch.$b$bWhatever the case, Gerenzo must be removed, and it would be a fitting test to have Fizziks take care of him.
Objective: Bring the new orders to Ziz Fizziks in the Stonetalon Mountains.
