Title: The Doorman of Karazhan
Description: Yes, it was me who devised this recipe. I have taught it to very few of the cooks that we had working within Karazhan. It was not widely appreciated, but adored by Medivh.$B$B I am not freely able to dispense with such information, but if you are able to produce a 'Charge of Karazhan' from Doorman Montigue, I could easily provide you with the recipe. Speak with him, and see to acquiring one.
Objective: Speak with Doorman Montigue in Karazhan.
