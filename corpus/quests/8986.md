Title: More Components of Importance
Description: $C, listen closely. Now that we have the location of the last amulet piece, we still need another component to suffuse the brazier with; something that will provide a focus strong enough to entice the spirit of my deceased, former comrade.$B$BMor Grayhoof, our most prominent druid, had many close friends amongst the Cenarion Circle, some of which have fallen to the silithid. I need you to retrieve some Druidical Remains from the silithid that inhabit the environs of Hive'Regal in southeastern Silithus.
Objective: Acquire Druidical Remains and return them to Bodley inside Blackrock Mountain.
