Title: The Ghostly Charm
Description: There was a time when we could roam freely around the island, a time when the Kalkor and the Razzari lived at peace, and even cooperated. During those times, I would often venture up and down the Silver Strand to admire the beauty of this island, and to explore.$B$BOn my last trip to the beaches, I had found ships torn apart upon the sand, and was shocked at the whispers of humanoid figures. It grasped upon my neck, and pulled free the charm I had bound there, taking it from my body as I raced back here.$B$BThat Charm is one of the only things I have left of the place we once came from, and I would ask you to get it back. You can find these wrecked ships to the north west, along the Silver Strand, my Charm must still be held by one of the ghosts there.
Objective: Find and Recover the Ghostly Charm for Tarokar in Kalkor Point.
