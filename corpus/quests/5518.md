Title: The Gordok Ogre Suit
Description: If you're going to fight the king of this dump - and I think that's what you're bound to do - then you're going to need to get by Captain Kromcrush.Now, you can get by him by killing him, sure.You might actually want to leave him alive.$B$BHow, you ask?Since I've been here, I think I know how to make an ogre suit that will last just long enough to fool these bozos.The only problem is stability - ten minutes tops.Bring me what I need, and I'll make you one.I'm not going anywhere...
Objective: Bring 4 Bolts of Runecloth, 8 Rugged Leather, 2 Rune Threads, and Ogre Tannin to Knot Thimblejack.He is currently chained inside the Gordok wing of Dire Maul.
