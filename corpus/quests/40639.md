Title: Not Useless!
Description: Heya kid, ready to do some actual work?$B$BYou'll be under my guidance, if I were you, I'd worry about how large my pockets are because I am about to fill them if you're doing a good enough job.$B$BBackstory time. Notice from yours truly, most of the time the things I am about to say require a tax per sentence for the listener but since you came from Nert himself I am willing to eh, oversee it.$B$BAnyway, where was I, ah yes. I used to be a big shot in Undermine back in my day, there was nobody, and I mean nobody I wouldn't cheat, lie, kill or steal from for my own goals!$B$B<Nash rubs his hands and giggles quietly to himself as your skin begins to crawl.>$B$BNaw, don't worry kid, those days are behind me. I was saying, I and the Venture Co. got history and especially with this idiot they've sent to oversee the oil fields.$B$BGo beat some of these idiots up and see if you can find any info on them.
Objective: Gather information from the Venture Co. Employees located around the Blacksand Oil Fields and return it to Senior Foreman Nazz Firecracker at Powder Town in Stonetalon Mountains.
