Title: Crystals of Power
Description: I'm sure you've noticed 'em, $N. They're everywhere!$B$BWhat am I talking about? Why, the crystals, of course!$B$BThe crystals... They're all over the crater. Most people ignore them, but I have a strange feeling that they hold power within them. I've been doing experiments here with them for a while, but I can't seem to find anything. Well, I haven't yet, anyway.$B$BSay, I'm running a little low on the crystals I have here -- think you might be able to collect some more for me?
Objective: Collect 7 Power Crystals of each color: red, blue, yellow, and green. Bring them to J.D. Collie at Marshal's Refuge.
