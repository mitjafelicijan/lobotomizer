Title: Wild Leather Shoulders
Description: Wild Leather shoulders support the wearer's frame extremely well, offering top notch protection of the upper arms and the shoulders themselves.As with all Wild Leather armor, a potent but random benefit is applied to the item as the wildvine is stitched in.$B$BFor this pattern, I will require six thick armor kits and a wildvine.That shouldn't be too tall of an order for you to fill.
Objective: Bring 6 Thick Armor Kits and a Wildvine to Pratt McGrubben in Feathermoon Stronghold.
