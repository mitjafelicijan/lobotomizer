Title: Rightful Heir
Description: I'm glad I was right about you. With the imminent danger out of the way, it is time for you to learn about the House Darlthos. Before the Scourge ravaged these lands, our house was one of the most prominent houses in all of Lordaeron. Yet now, we are divided, for my sister-in-law acts as a ruler to those still living.$B$BAnd therein lies our problem, for my wife is the only true heir to this land. You are certainly capable, which is why you have earned the right to an audience with Duchess Grelda. Follow the road south of Glenshire past the gates of the Tirisfal Uplands, and you will find my wife in manor alongside the road.$B$BOh, and make sure to give this letter to her. It's a... let's say, a recommendation of sorts.
Objective: Talk to Duchess Grelda in her manor and give her the letter from Duke Nargelas.
