Title: Are We There, Yeti?
Description: Now that I have what I need to cover the mechanical moving parts, I only need one other thing. Well, actually two. Two horns!$B$BThe ice thistle patriarchs and matriarchs have the largest horns, so of course, those are the ones I want. That type of yeti inhabits a cave to the southeast. There are plenty of them there; you shouldn't have any problem finding them.$B$BRemember, I only want the best looking ones -- no beat up or broken horns, please!
Objective: Collect 2 Pristine Yeti Horns for Umi Rumplesnicker in Everlook.
