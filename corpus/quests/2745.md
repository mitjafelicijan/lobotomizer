Title: Infiltrating the Castle
Description: Hmm, an interesting tale, and not one to be taken lightly. Yeah, I can help you, but what you need to do is divvy out a form of justice that's not... legal, if you're to see this through to the end.$B$BLescovar and Marzon need to be dealt with, and swiftly. Do you think you're capable of such a thing?$B$BYou decide. If so, then make haste to the castle and find an old friend of mine, a gnome named Tyrion. He's been watching Lescovar now for a couple weeks. He should be able to help you end this.
Objective: Speak to Tyrion in Stormwind Castle.
