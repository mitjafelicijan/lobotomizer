Title: The Eighteenth Pilot
Description: I'm going to be busy with working on integrating this new fuel regulator to our racer designs, but if you'd like to help out the team some more, talk to Razzeric. He's our pilot--well, our eighteenth pilot, to be exact--and he likes to add his own little modifications to the racers.$b$bHe's a little off his rocker, though, so try not to act too surprised.
Objective: Speak with Razzeric on the Shimmering Flats.
