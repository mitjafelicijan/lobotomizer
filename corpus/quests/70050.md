Title: Ms. Fix-it!
Description: That drunken fool! He's absolutely outrageous! I am here for serious matters, not mundane, meaningless tasks. I will not stand for this, no, no!$B$B$N, please, help me out. I'd rather pay you than give that man the satisfaction that he convinced someone of my intellect to do this laborsome chore.$B$BThere should be some old lumber around these ruins. This desolate place has no trees, it's just a barren wasteland as far as I can see! Try and find any lumber you can and bring it back to me so we can prepare a fire.
Objective: Gather some dry fire wood and return to Noli in the Badlands.
