Title: The Maul'ogg Crisis VII
Description: I have had many encounters within the Temple of Atal'Hakkar, long ages spent gazing upon its walls. It is a place of darkness and foul energies that have corrupted its once defenders. The Prophet Jammal'an speaks his foul, misbegotten words into the decaying remains of his people that call this place home. I desire you to venture into the catacombs of this place, to find the Prophet and gather from him the Atal'ai Rod. It should be kept close to where this troll channels his magic.$B$BThe Atal'ai Rod holds power in the magic of control, and should assist us in subjugating Lord Cruk'zogg.
Objective: Venture into the depths of the Temple of Atal'Hakkar and gather the Atal'ai Rod, bring it to Insom'ni to finish the spell.
