Title: Power in Uldaman
Description: Now that the demon has been removed, we must gain a power source.Unfortunately, the best power sources are usually the oldest and the hardest to get.It's neat how fate likes to take a bite out of you sometimes, isn't it?$B$BSo you're going to need to go to Uldaman and defeat the obsidian sentinel there.He's big, he's tough, and his power source packs a punch!$B$BI wish you the best of luck, $N.And if you don't get lucky then, well... it was nice knowing you.
Objective: Retrieve an Obsidian Power Source and bring it to Tabetha in Dustwallow Marsh.
