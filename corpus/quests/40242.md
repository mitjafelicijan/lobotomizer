I am Genzil Spannerlight, in charge of starting new projects and archiving the success and failure of old ones.$B$BI have a new idea that may potentially work, a charged shell to act as either a shield, or barrier to be both protective, and resistant to magic! Of course, we will need some shells first, and we don't have a bunch of metal to waste, but there are turtles around!$B$BGo out, and gather me 3 Pristine Lurker Shells!
