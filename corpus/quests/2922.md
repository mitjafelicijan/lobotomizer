Title: Save Techbot's Brain!
Description: When our beloved city Gnomeregan fell, a rogue spark must have jolted my poor creation, Techbot.  It once aided me and my associates with its countless gizmos and limitless store of information, but its positronic brain has polarized.  Now it's negatronic... and Techbot's behaviors are reversed.  It roams Gnomeregan in a frenzy!$B$BBut perhaps it can be salvaged.  Perhaps, if you can retrieve Techbot's memory core and bring it to me, I can discover the cause of the polarization and fix my poor Techbot.$B$B
Objective: Bring Techbot's Memory Core to Tinkmaster Overspark at the Gnomeregan Reclamation Facility.
