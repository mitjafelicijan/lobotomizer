Title: Breaking Contracts
Description: In the shady, hidden corners of Azeroth there is always a deal going on, you may not see it, but it's there. I got word of a deal going down on Thoradin's Wall that I want you to go and steal. The contract itself is that of a dear rival of mine, and if I can do anything to interrupt his business and make a profit, well I'm just smiling ear to ear.$B$BYou can find Thoradin's wall between Hillsbrad and the Arathi Highlands, it is what separates the two. Supposedly some ancient wall built by Stromgarde, or something of that nature.$B$BThe ramp should be on the Hillsbrad side of the wall, near the southern end, I do know they hired some Syndicate goons to watch the ramp, but they should be no problem for you. The main muscle will be an ogre name Thoregg who guards the packages there, him you should be careful of.$B$BGet the shipment, bring it back to me, easy yeah? Oh, and no matter what, don't open the crate.
Objective: Collect the Mysterious Shipment, and return it to 'Slip'.
