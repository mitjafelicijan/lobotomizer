Title: The "Hidden" Crew
Description: Fine, let's fulfill this favor and move along. There are many more profitable and useful things we can both spend our time on.$B$BThe crew of the Brightwater has been here the entire time, and I've known about it since the first night they showed up after that fireworks show of a battle.$B$BThey haven't exactly done the best job of disguising who or what they are. That, and my contacts are very reliable.$B$BYou'll find them on the lower levels of Booty Bay, where Wigcik stays.$B$BWhen you next see "Captain" Pazzle, tell him I've honored his silly favor.
Objective: Find the crew of the Brightwater on the lower levels of Booty Bay.
