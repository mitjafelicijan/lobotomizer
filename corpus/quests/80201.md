Title: Stocking Up on Wood
Description: Wagons full of refugees have arrived from the north, and more are surely on the way.$B$BBecause this was used as a dwarven hunting lodge, the larders are fully stocked with meat. Unfortunately, most of the meat was in the process of being salted and the lodge does not have ample firewood. Some of the refugees have already begun chopping wood for the lumber supply.$B$BGo out and collect some of the bundles of wood they've prepared. You'll find them near the trees growing around the lodge, but be careful not to venture too far out into the valley: The creatures of Loch Modan are too dangerous for a young $c such as yourself.
Objective: Collect 8 Bundles of Wood outside of the Farstrider Lodge.
