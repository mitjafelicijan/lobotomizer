Title: The Pumpkin Thieves
Description: This is outrageous! The nerve! First, they sneak around and scare our livestock. Then, they sneak in and pillage our barn. What's next? Rob our house? Kill us all in our sleep?! What do you think the guards are doing about this situation, hm? NOTHING!$B$BThese gnolls are getting bolder with every passing day, and I've had enough! The guards are of no help, but I see you've got some fire in your eye. Perhaps you can help keep me and my family safe?$B$BWhat? Pie? Listen here, those gnolls made off with all my pumpkins! Little barbarians have no idea how to cook anything besides crudely charring it! What in the blazes are they going to do with pumpkins?! If you want a pie so badly, go and get my pumpkins back.$B$BI've seen those mongrels scurry north across the road far beyond Goldshire. Perhaps someone at the Eastvale Logging Camp has seen where the little bandits are holed up. Ask the folks over there where my pumpkins have gone! While you're at it, put down as many of those filthy brigands as you can!
Objective: Bring back 7 Elwynn Pumpkins to Gramma Stonefield.
