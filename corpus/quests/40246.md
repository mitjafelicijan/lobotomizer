Title: Aged Deep-Rod
Description: The Harmonization Gem is something I had figured I would never retrieve, and now with it, we can begin to make a staff that can transport you to the others. I have lost full communication with them for some time, and even relaying messages, well, is a long process.$B$BThe Satyrs of Legash are a recent arrival, and they hold some magical ability. They have been known to carry Aged Deep-Rods, of which I will need one, being I do not have the materials readily available to enchant or imbue a staff for our purposes.$B$BYou can find those demons to the north west, find from them an Aged Deep-Rod, one of them must carry one.
Objective: Find an Aged Deep-Rod from Legash Satyrs for Keeper Iselus at the Tower of Eldara in Azshara.
