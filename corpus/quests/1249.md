Title: The Missing Diplomat
Description: You say Elling sent you here? Well then, the hospitality I expressed is now tenfold. Anything you need, just ask. I will do my best to aid you.$B$BHmm, Slim, you say? Not sure the name sounds familiar, but I'll keep my eyes out for him.$B$BDon't look now, $N, but the gentleman over by the exit is looking over here. He's listening to our conversation a little too intently if you catch my meaning? If I were you, I'd do what you can to subdue him before he makes a break for the door.
Objective: Subdue Tapoke Jahn before he escapes, and then return to Mikhail in Menethil.
