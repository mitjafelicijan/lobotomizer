Title: They're In The Way!
Description: <Mu'uta stares into the distance, one hand rubbing a massive scar on his face and the other holding his bow at his side.>$B$BA spider, $C. A spider caused this wound. Not inflicted it, mind you, but caused it.$B$B<He lowers his hand and his one functioning eye fixes on you.>$B$BI was hunting raptors. I need their feathers, the butcher needs the meat, the claws can be used as weapons, they're good creatures. A worthy opponent. If you misstep, into a web in my case, they'll leave their mark.$B$B<He grimaces and points at his scarred face.>$B$BSpiders, on the other hand, are useless. Their web is too sticky to use for armor or fletching, their carapace too brittle to make decent armor. They're in the way, $C. Kill them.
Objective: Kill 20 Plains Creepers in Arathi Highlands.
