Title: Iverron's Antidote
Description: We may be able to help Iverron, as I know of an antidote that should help with the poison. It requires some ingredients, though, before I can make it.$B$BI'll need Hyacinth mushrooms. You can find these growing under trees, or you may collect them from the grell south of here; they seem to have taken a liking to them. I'll also need Moonpetal lilies, which only grow around watery pools.$B$BThe last ingredient may prove the most difficult. From the very spiders that poisoned Iverron, collect Webwood ichor.
Objective: Collect 7 Hyacinth Mushrooms, 4 Moonpetal Lilies, and 1 Webwood Ichor for Dirania Silveshine in Shadowglen.
