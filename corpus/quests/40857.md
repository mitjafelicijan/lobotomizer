Title: Removing Leper Leadership
Description: Greetings adventurer, I am Teezle Dualflash, once widely known in Gnomeregan, and I have returned with valuable information that could greatly aid our cause. I have discovered the identity of the leader of the leper gnomes who has been causing chaos on the surface, and his name is Neevan Gubblewire. He has been rallying the lepers to his cause, continually causing trouble for the reclamation facility, hindering our efforts, and threatening the future success of our cause.$B$BThat is why I implore you, brave adventurer, to help us bring Neevan Gubblewire to justice. It will not be an easy task, but it must be done. You should be able to find him somewhere on the surface outside of Gnomeregan to the south of here. Will you help me with this matter?
Objective: Slay Neevan Gubblewire for Teezle Dualflash at the Gnomeregan Reclamation Facility in Dun Morogh.
