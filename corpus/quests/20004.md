My spirit is restless and I cannot and will not move on before my justice have been met. Yes, you've heard me well, this is not the Light's justice but the Ashbringer's.$BI am willing to give information to you, information that will let you be a part of something grand.$BInformation that once and for all will bring the demise of the Scarlet Crusade. And yes, surprisingly you are yet to end them.$BI ask for humility, from the one that defeated me in battle, from the one that liberated my soul.
