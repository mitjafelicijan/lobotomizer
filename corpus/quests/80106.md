Title: The Grumbling Grove
Description: Okay, look. A treasure hunter is gonna find some haunted forests from time to time, see? And we can't go back to the boss empty-handed. I mean CAN'T. Like he'll have us shipped off to the mines, can't.$B$BSo here's what we're gonna do, yeah? We're gonna try and grab the loot and get outta here quick-like. You've done good work so far, kid, so I'm counting on you for this job.$B$BThere looks to be more of the last crew's mechs further in this valley and, uh... some vultures that don't look real natural. Clear 'em out, and we'll see what's in there.
Objective: Kill 5 Animated Shredders and 5 Muttering Vultures in the Grumbling Grove.
