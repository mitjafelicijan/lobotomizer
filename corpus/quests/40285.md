Title: A Blademaster's Request
Description: My name is Katokar. Katokar Bladewind. I was a Blademaster of the Burning Blade. Now, I am a Blademaster of the Horde.$B$BI came to Azshara to avenge the death of a fallen comrade. During the Third War, he was here, fighting the Burning Legion. In the end, we won. Archimonde was defeated. But my friend died in a glorious battle.$B$BI have killed hundreds of demons since I came here, yet I am still restless. I need to find a Blade that belonged to him, he was a Blademaster like myself. A Blademaster has to be buried with his blade. Yet, my progress thus far has been fruitless. I found his broken corpse near the eastern shore, I know of a great tower watched by a keeper on the far eastern coast of Azshara, perhaps he may know more.
Objective: Speak with the 'keeper' on the far eastern coast of Azshara, and return to Katokar with news.
