Title: Scourge of the Downs
Description: Outstanding!My name is Belnistrasz, and I thank you for rescuing me.I had given myself up for dead... or worse, as a meal for these Scourge-infested vermin.Yes - I said Scourge all right; they've brokered some sort of deal with the Quilboar here, and this nightmare is a result.$B$BListen... rather than just flee, I want to make a difference for all of our sakes.Would you be up to helping me out to that end?It's probably dangerous, but you seem to be the type not to worry about that too much.
Objective: If you agree to aid Belnistrasz, speak with him again and hand the Oathstone he gave you back to him.
