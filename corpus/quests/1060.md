Title: Letter to Jin'Zil
Description: You've done so well for me, $n. You're a regular lucky rabbit's foot and there's something I want you to see.$B$BThe harpies are not from around the Barrens. They come from a place called Stonetalon, far to the northwest of here. Though it is probably a dangerous place for you, I need this letter delivered to an old friend of mine who lives there, a witch doctor by the name of Jin'Zil.$B$BHe'll be happy to know that Serena Bloodfeather is dead, and I think you'll find Stonetalon an interesting place.
Objective: Deliver Darsok's letter to Jin'Zil within his cave in Malaka'Jin, in Stonetalon.
