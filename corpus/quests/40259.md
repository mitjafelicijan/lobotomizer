Title: The Dark-Rune Anvil
Description: I did some digging over the book a bit ago, it would appear that crafting of runic weapons and armor requires a Dark-Rune Anvil. I certainly don't have any sort of thing around here, but I do know a place that may.$B$BWithin the depths of Stratholme is a large slaughterhouse, it is where Baron Rivendare has called home for the time being. The Dark-Rune Anvil should be located there, and from it, you shall temper the blade!$B$BI have learned a lot, and I thank you plenty friend! I will continue my studies and perhaps one day we may be able to outright nullify our enemies equipment through my research.$B$BGo, and venture into the depths of that place, and claim what is yours, oh and if anyone asks, we haven't spoken!
Objective: Reach the Dark-Rune Anvil deep within Stratholme, with it, temper the Untempered Runeblade and claim your rightful prize.
