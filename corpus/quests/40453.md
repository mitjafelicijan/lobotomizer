The last thing we need is more forces coming from outside of the walls to assist those that are within.$B$BTo the north just outside of the city is Boulder'gor, a small outpost that is an ogre sanctuary. I need you to go there, and bring the fight to them, so that more do not come pouring into the city.$B$BBring me twenty Boulderfist Truncheon's as proof, and Stromgarde shall reward you.
Objective: Gather 20 Boulderfist Truncheon's for Sergeant Karster in Gallant Square at Stromgarde Keep.
