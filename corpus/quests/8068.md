Title: Paragons of Power: The Illusionist's Mantle
Description: Magic is a raw, primal force to be shaped by those strong enough to do it.  Mojo is our extension of this power; one such potent manipulation of it is in the form of illusion.  How can one truly hope to win against a foe that is not even really there?  We Zandalar know the power of this, and as such illusionists hold a honored place within the tribe.$B$BTake the needed Paragons of Power from Zul'Gurub - for this, honor from the tribe and a powerful mantle used by our best illusionists will be yours!
Objective: Bring Al'tabim the All-Seeing a Primal Hakkari Shawl.  You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Honored with the Zandalar Tribe.$B$BAl'tabim the All-Seeing is located on Yojamba Isle, Stranglethorn Vale.
