Title: Taming the Beast
Description: I often miss taking a dip in Stone Cairn Lake, but nowadays it's fully ridden with the wildlife, the gruesome gnolls, the slimy murlocs, or the foolish rogues of the Defias. Oh well, there's no reason to lament peaceful times, for peaceful times will surely return soon enough.$B$BTravel east towards the Logging Camp, and near its outskirts, you should be able to find Prowlers. Compared to the domesticated boar, you may have more difficulty taming this feral creature of the forests. Though scary as it may be, once you've conquered your own fear, you will have no better companion. For the lupine race is very likely to create a bond with its master that will last for perhaps the rest of its life.
Objective: Use the Taming Rod to tame a Prowler. Practice your skills, then return the Taming Rod to Daisy Windhelm in Goldshire.
