Title: In Foreign Hearts
Description: The very forest itself is twisted and corrupted. Everywhere we look, we see the festering and lingering presence of this evil. The wildlife has been cursed to live such woeful existences, constantly teetering on the brink of madness and rage, all the while enthralled by the great evil that poisons their hearts.$B$BI have been studying the wildlife here for some time now, but I need more samples to understand this phenomenon better. Recently, I discovered a natural occurrence taking place in Tel'Abim. The enragement of the wildlife there has traveled to my ears, and I need to know more about it to potentially link it to what's happening here.$B$BFor this reason, I require five hearts of the enraged basilisk. Bring them to me, and I will make good use of the samples you provide. Let us make progress in our understanding of this curse.
Objective: Bring 5 Twisted Basilisk Hearts from Gravelhide Basilisks in Tel'Abim to Golhine the Hooded at Talonbranch Glade in Felwood.
