Title: Broken Cliff Inspection
Description: The Venture Company has been very active in Stonetalon. Eroding the natural beauty, and spreading the marks of industry wherever it is that they go. One such location of their exploitation was that of Broken Cliff Mine just to the southeast of here, nestled just west of the pathway up to Stonetalon Peak.$B$BMy sources have told me that it has been overrun by the Deepmoss spiders who have run off and consumed most of the workers there. Nature itself is not to be underestimated, and yet those greedy goblins continue to do so.$B$BI need you to travel to Broken Cliff Mine, and scour the campsites there to find any documents of their plans. Perhaps we can be one step ahead of them next time.
Objective: Scour the Broken Cliff Mine and locate any documents for Dalanas Swiftfeather at Stonetalon Peak in Stonetalon Mountains.
