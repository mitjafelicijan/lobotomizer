Title: No Shortcuts To Salvation
Description: Amidst the captivating beauty of lush foliage and verdant landscapes, a subtle undercurrent of darkness threatens our existence here in the Thalassian Highlands. We relentlessly pursue knowledge to curb the growing addiction to mana that pervades our birthright, while our adversaries dangle the dangerous allure of fel magic. Already they have ensnared some of our kin in their sinister grasp.$B$BOnly recently have we discovered a source of fel magic nearby, traced to the Isle of Eternal Autumn in the west. No doubt the Blood Elves have their hand in this, trying to allure those more desperate to the emanations of their dark magic. Seek out this tainted energy, and bring it to me so that it may be properly destroyed.
Objective: Discover the source of the fel magic lingering on the Isle of Eternal Autumn and bring it to Sinodas Azuresky at the Citadel of the Sun in Alah'Thalas so that it may be destroyed.
