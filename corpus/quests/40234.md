Title: A New Rune-Frontier
Description: Omarion left behind plenty of work and research on various topics, one of which I have taken quite an interest within! Runeblades, Rune Armor, such fascinating things, imbued and powered directly by Dreadlords. I heard that Baron Rivendare fellow had one, but I am seeking the knowledge of imbuing a freshly created blade, and tempering it with great power! If we could unlock such secrets then certainly it would be a new frontier of all sorts of magical crafting!$B$BIf you can figure out a way to create your own Untempered Runeblade I would be more then willing to share my knowledge!
Objective: Craft an Untempered Runeblade, and return to Craftsman Wilhelm.
