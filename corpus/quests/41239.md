Title: Rommath, the Traitor
Description: With the current situation in the Regency Council, my hands are bound. No one but Lor'Themar would believe me, even with the letter in our possession. They would undoubtedly perceive my actions as an attempt to usurp the title.$B$BHowever, all is not lost. If you can convince Rommath that you are, indeed, a delegation from Felstrider Retreat, he may inadvertently reveal more about his plans. The letter is exceedingly vague, and this approach may unveil additional details. Go, but exercise caution to avoid exposing your true identity. Rommath is unpredictable, and he could dispose of you in the blink of an eye.$B$BHe is on the top of the tower.
Objective: Report to Grand Magister Rommath. He can be found on the top of the Regency Tower.
