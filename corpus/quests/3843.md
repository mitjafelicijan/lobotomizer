Title: The Newest Member of the Family
Description: A magnificent specimen, $N. If this creature survives gestation, then it'll be a healthy pet indeed!$B$BThere is one last thing I would suggest doing if you plan on following through with this--head to Aerie Peak in the Hinterlands. Speak to a dwarf there named Agnar Beastamer, he's a master animal handler and should be able to guide you in the final steps of incubation.$B$BBut hurry, $N, this egg is fragile and will not last long without proper care.
Objective: Take your Fragile Sprite Darter Egg to the Hinterlands and speak to Agnar Beastamer, but hurry, you only have 1 hour to find him before the hatchling within the egg dies.
