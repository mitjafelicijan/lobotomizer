Title: The Boran Family
Description: I come from a large family, one that once occupied the boroughs of Kul Tiras. We weren't exactly a rich family, but we were not poor either! I traveled out with two of my brothers when the third war started up in Lordaeron, hoping to earn some fortune and glory. I helped the navy , my brother Karl started work in Menethil Harbor, while Samual went to Southshore to assist the war effort.$B$BEver since I set sail years ago, I have had no communication with them, and would like to reach out if you could deliver a letter to the both of them. They must have thought I perished after so long without a word or peep and I want to ease their minds.
Objective: Deliver the letters from Arnold Boran to his two brothers.
