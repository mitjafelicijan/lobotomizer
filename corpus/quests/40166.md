Title: The Tower of Lapidis IV
Description: Now, to begin, I will transmute some of the energy from the Pure Aqua Orb and enchant the key with the magic that once was present. This may take a few moments to do, and I require precise concentration. Give me but a moment, and I will be done.
Objective: Wait for Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver to finish his magic.
