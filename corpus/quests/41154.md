Title: Pit-Iful Work
Description: You! What are you just wandering around like a headless murloc? We are behind the quota and lazy goblins like you aren't gonna make it any better by slacking all our precious potential gold away! The Durotar Labor Union will drive itself to ruin if they don't go back to their profitable roots.$B$BQuick, go out and be a good example for your goblins by collecting coal around the pits. Don't you dare tarry around too long or I will send a bruiser to check up on you!
Objective: Gather ten pieces of Coal from the coalpiles around the Black Ash Coalpits and bring them to Overseer Kizzcrack.
