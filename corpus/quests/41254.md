Title: Deepmurk Darkness
Description: Have you ventured to the Farstride recently?$B$BIt's a stunning beach, marred only by the presence of murlocs and other nefarious creatures. Among them, none are as troublesome as the Deepmurk. These murlocs, hailing from the darkest depths of the sea, inexplicably decided to leave their aquatic abode and take residence in a cave on the Farstride. Their relentless attacks on our rangers and fishermen have rendered this magnificent stretch of land entirely uninhabitable.$B$BIf you could cull their population, you shall be duly rewarded.
Objective: Cull the population of Deepmurk murlocs for Nirenia Swiftsun.
