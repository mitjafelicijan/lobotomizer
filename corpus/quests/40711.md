Title: Major Magical Fortifications
Description: Greetings. The Council of Dalaran is currently accepting donations of the magical kind from outside sources. The innate power of Large Brilliant Shards are only rivaled by the enigmatic Nexus Shards, only found on locations of major interest and acquired from artifacts of great power. For a Large Brilliant Shard I'll put in a good word of your efforts within Dalaran, the most you can get from a single donation.
Objective: Bring 1 Large Brilliant Shard to Magus Palon at Dalaran.
