Description: What an honor it was when Master Greywhisker assigned me to work under the guidance of the great Prospector Remtravel. At the academy in Ironforge everyone knew of Remtravel's great discoveries.$b$bBut the prospector is rather... um... oblivious ...to his surroundings.$b$bWe had uncovered evidence of a great society.

Objective: Travel south and check on Prospector Remtravel.
