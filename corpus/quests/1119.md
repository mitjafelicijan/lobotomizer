Title: Zanzil's Mixture and a Fool's Stout
Description: I figured out how to use Zanzil's mixture with stout to make a powerful libation.A Fool's Stout.I think it'll be just what Kravel needs, but try it out and let me know how it works.$B$BAnd $N, don't keep this stuff too long without using it.Zanzil's mixture has a weird effect on the stout's yeast, kicking it into high gear.So it won't stay fresh forever.
Objective: Bring the Fool's Stout back to Kravel in the Shimmering Flats.
