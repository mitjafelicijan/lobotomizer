Title: Rooting Out Corruption
Description: I fear there is no recourse but to destroy the treant lest it cause harm to our people or the creatures of Teldrassil. From the information Tasala provided, we can safely assume that it will be patrolling the eastern banks of the Wellspring Lake.$B$BSeek the Distorted Treant out, give it a merciful end, and bring back a sample of its roots that I may better understand what possessed it. Exercise caution; a Protector is not likely to go without a fight.$B$BGo quickly now. That treant may hold answers to what lies at the heart of nature's unrest here in Teldrassil.
Objective: Destroy the Distorted Treant and bring its Withered Roots to Malos Lunarspear in Teldrassil.
