Title: Hints of a New Plague?
Description: So, Phin sent you to check on us? Not surprised--he worries too much.$B$BWe've been watching the farm for days, and Kin claims she saw a courier come out of that small house to the south not long ago.$B$BShe talks a lot, but I can always trust her senses when we're in dangerous areas.$B$BYou wouldn't happen to be a skilled tracker, would you? We think the courier might be carrying notes to Tarren Mill. If we could get our hands on those documents, it might shed some light on what's happening in Hillsbrad.
Objective: Find the Forsaken Courier and bring back her Sealed Folder to Quae near the Go'Shek Farm.
