Title: Reports of Dustwallow
Description: Hey there, you look tough enough to handle yourself, and Theramore is in need of some assistance. My last runner was ambushed on the roadway, and suffered a rather grevious wound. If we want to keep our defence of the roadway through Dustwallow then we need to remain steadfast.$B$BAs such, I haven't received the weekly reports from both Sentry Point, and North Point.$B$BI want you to report to Captain Wallace Cross at Sentry Point Tower, and Captain Harker at North Point Tower, and bring their reports back to me.
Objective: Collect the Sentry Point Report, and the North Point Report for Colonel Breen at Theramore Isle in Dustwallow Marsh.
