Title: The Divination Scryer
Description: We now must assemble a Divination Scryer - this will begin the trial that will allow you to redeem the fallen charger.Your scryer, actually, is almost done.The exorcism censer used in Terrordale is the catalyst for it, and I will fashion a suitable housing for the device.$B$BThe last components needed, though, are two diamonds.They must be as juxtaposed in brilliance as they are in purpose - an Azerothian and a Pristine Black.These two will be the beacon by which the scryer will pierce the shadows!
Objective: Bring an Azerothian Diamond and a Pristine Black Diamond to Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker in the Cathedral District of Stormwind.
