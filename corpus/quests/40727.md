Title: Derelict Supplies
Description: It's getting difficult to maintain repairs on much of the machinery, especially with all of the chaos recently.$B$BI'm experienced, but I'm lacking a lot of my tools, bub. You know how hard it is to work with a spanner when you really need a spin-wrench?$B$BJust to the north of here is a place called 'The Derelict Camp.' Well, at one point it wasn't so derelict. We used to have many operations there: wood cutting, banana collecting, and much more. It's there I lost my toolbox with all my gizmos, and I want it back.$B$BYou can find the camp on the western edge of the island. Follow the road up north, and you'll find it.
Objective: Travel to the Derelict Camp and recover Wazlon's Tools for Wazlon Headiron at Tel Co. Basecamp in Tel'abim.
