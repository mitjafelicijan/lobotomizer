Title: Scythe of the Goddess
Description: I wish I could tell you more about it, but alas, in my state, I was unable to procure any meaningful information. Lord Blackwald used it to summon the worgen to Karazhan, and they more or less obeyed his command. $B$BAs for the Dark Riders, they are cursed to be artifact hunters, crafted in the twisted image of the righteous knights by Medivh himself. Though his presence has long faded, these relentless hunters continue their pursuit, tirelessly acquiring treasures for an unknown master.$B$BOh, how I long for the ability to unmask the hidden purpose behind this mysterious relic. However, I offer you a glimmer of hope in your quest. Seek those who, perhaps unwittingly, aided the Dark Riders in their pursuit. Turn your gaze towards my former realm, once known as Great Hamlet, where secrets and whispers intertwine. It is there that your search may bear fruit, as rumors tell of worgen now roaming the kingdom, their presence a testament to a connection with the Scythe.
Objective: Find someone in Duskwood who might know more about the Scythe of Elune.
