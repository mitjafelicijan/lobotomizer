Title: The Dread Citadel - Naxxramas
Description: In the thick of Plaguewood lies the entrance to the dread citadel of Naxxramas. Previously, all attempts to enter had been stymied by the magical wards placed upon the rune portal. That is, until now.$B$BWe have devised a way to gain entry via a permanent arcane cloaking of sorts - an old cantrip of the Kirin Tor with a few modifications of my own. With that said, the cloaking is costly. Since your dedication to the cause of the Dawn is admirable, we are willing to incur some of those costs.
Objective: Archmage Angela Dosantos at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands wants 2 Arcane Crystals, 1 Nexus Crystal and 30 gold pieces. You must also be Revered with the Argent Dawn.
