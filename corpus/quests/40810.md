Title: Reporting our Victory
Description: The moonberry cordial and spirits flow freely around here after what we have done. Amongst us at least, the coward Ironglade barely shows his face, knowing he stood by and watched while the real guardians of the land stood tall. Though you have all our thanks, I think there is one more person who would like to hear about this first hand. Here, take this report to Lady Whisperwind in Darnassus. She will likely be with the other priestesses in the Temple of the Moon. Do not worry, it speaks rather favorably of you, and I am sure she will know what to do next.$B$BOh, and feel free to take your time on this one, we're going nowhere soon. Enjoy some fish on the way in Auberdine, enjoy the boat trip to Teldrassil. Try not to get too drunk!
Objective: Take the Sealed Forest Song Report to Tyrande Whisperwind in Darnassus.
