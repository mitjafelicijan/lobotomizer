Title: Melding of Influences
Description: Here is some encased ooze created from the Felwood samples you recovered. Take the case to Un'Goro Crater and find a pure ooze... the primal variety will do nicely. When you get close enough, release the ooze in the case, and let us see what the two think of one another.$B$BAfter the experiment concludes, bring me a sample of whatever is left over. I will await you here in the Apothecarium.
Objective: Bring a Merged Ooze Sample to Chemist Fuely in Undercity.
