Title: Scarlet Subterfuge
Description: I am what you would call, an illusionist. Though I may be able to create an illusion to allow you entry into Hearthglen, be warned; my powers have their limitations.$B$BShould you travel too far from these lands, the effects of the illusion will cease. The spell itself takes a great amount of concentration and power from me, and thus, I can only sustain the effect for a short time.$B$BSpeak to me again when you are ready.
Objective: Speak to Myranda to gain the Scarlet Illusion. Travel to Hearthglen while under the Scarlet Illusion and deliver Tirion's Gift to Highlord Taelan Fordring.$B$BHearthglen is to the north, Taelan should be inside of Mardenholde Keep.
