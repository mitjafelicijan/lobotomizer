Title: Wild Fires in Kalimdor
Description: The Midsummer Fire Festival is celebrated everywhere in Azeroth, and the diverse land of Kalimdor is no exception. You look fit to travel -- perhaps a journey is in order.$b$bMidsummer cannot be truly appreciated unless you've seen the blistering blue fires abroad.

Return once your journey is complete.
Objective: Visit the Midsummer camps located in Azshara, Silithus, Un'Goro Crater, and Winterspring, then return to the Festival Flamekeeper.
