Title: Into the Uplands
Description: Hey there, traveler. I am looking for someone to deliver a parcel which I have needed to ship for some time now. I have not fulfilled my obligations with all of the comings and goings here at the sepulcher.$B$BUp north, past Valgan's and The Dead Field, is a passageway that leads into the Tirisfal Uplands. It is pressed against the mountains and somewhat hidden, but the keen eye should spot it.$B$BOnce you make your way into the Uplands, I need this parcel delivered to Apothecary Volgrin. He should be located fairly close to the passage leading through the cliffs.
Objective: Deliver Volgrin's Parcel to Apothecary Volgrin near the entrance to the Tirisfal Uplands.
