Title: Border Crossings
Description: As you may know, the town of Ambermill remains a source of human opposition, mainly through the support they receive from the wizards of Dalaran.$b$bI don't know what their plan is, but for them to show interest in a backwater village like Ambermill indicates that it must have some greater importance.$b$bThey've been shipping crates by the wagon from Hillsbrad. Many of those supplies end up at a small camp north of Pyrewood Village. Retrieve the contents of a crate and return them to me.
Objective: Retrieve the contents of one of the Dalaran wizards' crates. You will find Pyrewood Village to the south.
