Title: Broodling Imposters?!
Description: Howdy there friend! Wanna hear a little story I was told from a friend? It's so crazy you wouldn't believe it!$B$BAparently while she was venturing through the Burning Steppes she ran across a Black Dragonflight Whelp, which, isn't out of the normal, given just how many there is in the region. When she ended up shooting it, no blood came out, just puffs of smoke, and whirrs of machinery!$B$BUpon inspection it was discovered to have been a mechanical creation layered with replica skin, can you believe that?!$B$BNow that sure is magnificent engineering, so magnificent it has fooled even the dragons. I'd like to see how it was done, if you wouldn't mind helping. Get me six bundles of Robotic Broodling Guts from each one you find, that should be enough to figure things out.
Objective: Gather 6 Robotic Broodling Guts from robotic whelps in Burning Steppes for Masey Wirefuse in Ironforge.
