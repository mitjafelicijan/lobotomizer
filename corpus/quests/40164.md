Title: The Tower of Lapidis II
Description: Arch Hydromancer Lapidis held incredibly skills in Hydromancy, and was much stronger than many even upon Boralus. Many had their opinions on how the man was able to achieve such power, though I always gave him the benefit of the doubt. I believe he has had some assistance from either a magical artifact, or an outside force, though I cannot prove my suspicions.$B$BRegardless, if there is a way in the tower, I would believe it to be this key. <Hydromancer Flakereef produces a small Shimmering Brass Key>.$B$BThis key was given to me by Lapidis before we had arrived, he entrusted it within my care, I was to be one of his pupils, but after he created the large tower, and began to close himself off from the rest I instead returned here. This key fits the lock to the tower, but cannot open it, and perhaps requires some magical attuning to grant access.$B$BWe must look to those with a greater knowledge of the Arcana, Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver of Dalaran may perhaps help, seek him out.
Objective: Bring the Shimmering Brass Key to Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver in Dalaran.
