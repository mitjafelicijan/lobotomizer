Title: Expedition Supplies
Description: Only shortly ago, we learned that not all of Daelin Proudmoore's lieutenants were slain in the War for Durotar. We were expecting their return, but we did not think they'd be so well-armed.$B$BAll wars are fought on supplies, however, and there is no doubt they are stretched thin so far from their homeland.$B$BSearch their camps on the southern rims of the Echo Isles and pillage their stocks â€” they may be forced to leave before ever setting foot near Orgrimmar.
Objective: Gather 6 Bundles of Expedition Supplies for Warbringer Dar'nakk in Razor Hill in Durotar.
