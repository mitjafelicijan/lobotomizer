Title: Report to Dreamwind
Description: It would appear that the Oozes are linked to surges of intense and dark magical powers. Lingering as an after effect to great magical energy itself. Perhaps this is a natural occurance, or something much deeper.$B$BIn truth, I cannot be certain if my evidence is correct, or if I am looking in the right area. Regardless, I have prepared a report for Arch Druid Dreamwind in Hyjal. It should explain everything I have come to find.$B$BI must thank you for your assistance, without you, I would still be digging through oozes.
Objective: Bring Canos' Report to Dreamwind at Nordanaar in Hyjal.
