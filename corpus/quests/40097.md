Title: In the Dark
Description: With their scouts gone, we can finally go on the offensive.  But before we can orchestrate an attack on their main camp, we need to reduce their ability to monitor our movement.$B$BJust north of the Whispering Woods, there is a tower called Shatteridge. The Remnant's Sentries have made that tower their center of operation, and they are there to warn their main base of any potential danger. Their numbers at the Shatteridge are great, which is precisely the reason why they won't expect a single, yet powerful foe to attack them directly. So are you up to the task?
Objective: Slay 10 Remnant Sentries at the Shatteridge Tower and return to Duke Nargelas.
