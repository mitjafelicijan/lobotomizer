Title: Requisitioning a Core
Description: Yo! Good to see you, man! I made progress but see, somethin's missing, and I doubt it can be found here—not in an intact state anyway. A normal power source won't do, not for this baby.$B$BIt requires some major juice, so either hook it up to a massive generator the size of a house, which I cannot currently acquire... Or we collect a compatible power core! There's a ruin in the other part of the continent—Uldaman, I believe it's called, yeah!$B$BIt's made by those Titanics or whatever they're called. Go to this ruin and get me a core. The deeper part of the complex is exposed there, so you can do it!
Objective: Acquire an Intact Power Core from Uldaman's Ancient Treasure.
