Title: Haze of Evil
Description: To tell you the truth, $N, I've never seen any plants like this in my travels. Perhaps I should take a trip to this crater...$B$BAt any rate, I think I know just the thing Muigin's looking for -- Atal'ai haze. It's horrid stuff, hard to collect, but it's just what he needs to control the little monsters.$B$BYou'll need to visit the temple of Atal'Hakkar in the Swamp of Sorrows. The Atal'ai Haze can be collected from the deep lurkers, murk worms, or oozes found there. Good luck, $N!
Objective: Collect 5 samples of Atal'ai Haze, then return to Muigin in Un'Goro Crater.
