Title: The Mortal Strike
Description: The time has come to end this conflict with one decisive blow. Well, two actually. I have done some searching of my own while you were gone, and while the sentinels were off playing hero. There are two leaders of this operation, and both will need to be brought low and executed, if we are to know peace once more in these glades. You must find their Commander, a brutish orc by the name of Grushak, somewhere to the south of the Camp. And plotting from the Keep itself, is a shaman by the name of Grimeye.$B$BIf you need companions to help you assassinate these targets, I certainly would not blame you. In fact, I would view it as very wise indeed - for every failed attempt will certainly make our lives a lot more difficult afterwards.
Objective: Slay Commander Grushak and Farseer Grimeye for Brolthan Ironglade at Forest Song in Ashenvale.
