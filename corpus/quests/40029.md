Title: Hunting the Hunters
Description: The lost ones of Fallow Sanctuary are a menace to the Harborage. Every day, we must live in fear that they attack in their state of madness. We do not have the Draenei to fight them off should they ever gather into a large enough force.$B$BThe Muckdwellers have been scouting the Harborage for days now, and I sense that they may be preparing for something. I ask you to help us slay the maddened ones and give us a chance of survival. You will find them to the east, but be careful. They are extremely hostile.
Objective: Slay 8 Lost One Muckdwellers and 3 Lost One Hunters.
