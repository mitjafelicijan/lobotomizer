Title: Stop the Dragonflight
Description: The Blue Dragonflight has been in Azshara since time immemorial, but their recent actions seem strange. They had been there to safeguard ancient artifacts, not drain the leylines of life and magic. In better, simpler times, I would advise you to contact them and try to negotiate.$B$BThose times are over, and we need to act. Go back to Azshara and gather a strong party. Venture to Lake Mennar, and slay their kin. This will thin the numbers in their ranks, and we will have time to prepare a better response to their actions.$B$BA sad thing that the Dragonflight has begun to mess with the very ways of Azsharas natural magic. When it is done, return to Yhargosh at Bloodfist Point.
Objective: Slay Tarangos.
