Title: Black Lotus Collection
Description: Black Lotus is a scarce and extremely rare herb that the druids of Nordrassil use for very important purposes. Much of the magic here can be amplified by the addition of its magical properties! Bring me a single Black Lotus, and I will trade you two Bright Dream Shards in exchange at any time.
Objective: Gather a Black Lotus for Tanalla Sagebranch at Nordanaar in Hyjal.
