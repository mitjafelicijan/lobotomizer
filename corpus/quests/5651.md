Title: In Favor of Darkness
Description: There are many lessons that the Forsaken have learned through experience--things that some races can only begin to fathom. And although our path lies in darkness, you will find that a great many things rely on both the light and the dark. Your lessons shall teach you to use both... and with discretion. But heed my words: never forget we were forged in corruption and left to rot like so much carrion. The Darkness is our home.$B$BSeek out Dark Cleric Beryl in Brill when you're ready to learn more.
Objective: Speak to Dark Cleric Beryl in Tirisfal Glades.
