Title: Leaders of the Reefscale
Description: Some of the Naga have the ability to call upon the tides, submerging entire regions. If they're performing such a ritual, our fate may be sealed. I implore you to steel your resolve and ready your sea legs, for you are the one destined to thwart their plans.$B$BThe Naga function under a strict hierarchy. If you can eliminate their leaders, their forces will scatter and retreat to the depths of Nazjatar. Ensure the demise of their commanders, but it wouldn't hurt to dispatch a few of their sunderers as well. Just for the thrill of it.$B$B<Sira chuckles beneath her helmet.>
Objective: Slay the leaders of the Reefscale and 8 Reefscale Sunderers for Sira Moonwarden.
