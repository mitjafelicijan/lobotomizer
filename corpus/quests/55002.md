Title: Supplies to the Port!
Description: You the new delivery kid from Razor Hill? Didn't really think that old orc would get the order here that quick. You better not tell him we've just been giving him flak! He might start to think he's doing too good a job, or something!
Objective: Deliver the Sealed Trade Goods to the nearby Port Town of Sparkwater to the north-east of Razor Hill.
