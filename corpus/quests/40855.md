Title: A Chief Among Brutes
Description: Recent events have made me reconsider my outlook on life. Or, lack thereof.$B$BWhat is it that demands the most respect in this world, $N? I would say that is power. Raw and unadulterated. Sheer strength of will, force of arm, power. And what causes any kingdom to fall into ruins, to crumble into ash? The loss of leadership, the lack of power!$B$B Ah, forget my musings and ramblings, I have much too much time and much too much contempt. To speak plainly: the Brol'ok have a champion vying for power in their little mounds, known as Maulfist. He is called a chief, even amongst the ogres, so he must be exceptionally powerful... bring me his crown, if you can. I will reward you handsomely if so.
Objective: Bring the Crown of Maulfist to Deathstalker Vernon at Stillward Church in Gilneas.
