Title: An Infinite Hunt
Description: I have been hunting her for a while now, but she is extremely elusive!  Every time we get close, she escapes. However, she intends to contact you again. This time we'll set a trap. Go to Seradane, avoid the Emerald Portal and proceed to the largest temple.  You'll find another of her corrupted time crystals. Use it and summon her. Then I will appear and we will defeat her together!
Objective: Go to Seradane's Temple and defeat Antnormi, return to Chromie in Andorhal.
