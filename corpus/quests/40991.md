Title: For the Collection
Description: In my previous life as a living man, I was enthralled by the tales of the Azotha, our long-lost human predecessors from a bygone age. Their ancient knowledge and artifacts fascinated me.$B$BAlas, the tumultuous situation in Gilneas hindered my research on the Azotha, trapping me within these confining walls. Now, the gates have finally opened, but as a forsaken, venturing into human lands would be my ultimate demise.$B$BHowever, I have heard whispers of a secluded city known as Corthan, nestled in the treacherous Badlands. Legends speak of a powerful and enigmatic Azotha artifact hidden within its abandoned wallsâ€”the Hand of Corthan. Although the true nature of this relic eludes me, I am certain that it holds great significance and would be a valuable addition to my collection.
Objective: Bring the Hand of Corthan to Dark Bishop Mordren at Stillward Church in Gilneas.
