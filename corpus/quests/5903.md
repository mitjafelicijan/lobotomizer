Title: A Plague Upon Thee
Description: I've tried many times to rout out the Scarlet Crusade through force alone, but to no avail. So, as an alternative, I've decided to make their lives more difficult.$B$BIf you are willing to help, I want to infest that lumber mill with the most terrible species of termites ever found.$B$BIn Plaguewood, near the once-great Stratholme, there is a breed that survived the plague and the Scourge combined. Find their mounds and fill this jar with them, so we can prepare them to be unleashed on the Crusade.
Objective: Use the Empty Termite Jar on the Termite Mounds in Eastern Plaguelands. After you've gathered 100 Plagueland Termites, return to Nathaniel Dumah at Chillwind Camp in Western Plaguelands.
