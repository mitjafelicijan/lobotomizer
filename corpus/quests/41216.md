Title: The Highland Menace
Description: Welcome to Thaumarium. Within these walls, my enchanting wife crafts the finest wines to grace the Thalassian Highlands. We've bestowed upon this haven the same name as our erstwhile winery in Quel'Thalas, harboring eager anticipation for the prosperity of our venture.$B$BHowever, a quandary befalls us. Our aspirations lead us to cultivate a vineyard in the hills southeast of this sanctuary. The microclimate there is exceptionally conducive to grape cultivation. Alas, these very hills are plagued by a savage breed of lynx, making it impossible for our workers to toil the soil in peace. I implore you to eliminate as many of these creatures as you can and return with their furs as tangible proof of their demise. Your assistance shall not go unrewarded.
Objective: Bring 10 Bright Lynx Furs to Maelor Steelguard in the Thaumarium.
