Title: The Eldarath Project
Description: There's always new projects popping up, and subsequently turning up worthless!$B$BIt seems this region is cursed, or I am, anyway, with my horrid luck.$B$BFrix is haunting me from the grave, but still, there are a few of our projects that I'd like to see through.$B$BTo the east lays the ancient Highborne city of Eldarath. Now you won't find any friendly elves, but instead twisted versions of them...$B$BNaga occupy almost the entirety of the ruins, it's mostly why me and Frix never bothered with pushing this project forward.$B$BNow with you around though, we can finally test it out! Go to the Ruins of Eldarath to the east. Once there, look for small shards of energy known as Eldarath Ley-Shards.
Objective: Venture to the Ruins of Eldarath and find 5 Eldarath Ley-Shards.
