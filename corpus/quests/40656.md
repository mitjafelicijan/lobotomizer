Title: Bane of Scalebane
Description: Perhaps I should apologise for not being as informed as I would have liked. Had I known how established this camp already was, I would have tasked an assassination of their leader.$B$BActually, perhaps you are ardent for blood and glory. Head back into that camp, find their leader, and kill him. Not a complicated task, but one that may be more dangerous than before. He will surely be prepared for this, given your previous efforts.
Objective: Slay Kegdesh Foulmantle in Scalebane Ridge for Lexlort at Kargath in the Badlands.
