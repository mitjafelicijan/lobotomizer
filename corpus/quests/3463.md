Title: Set Them Ablaze!
Description: Listen well, $N. While the four towers can never be destroyed, you can use the torch of retribution to set them ablaze for a very long period of time: A fire that no element or force can subdue.$B$BWhile they are ablaze, no guard or sentry unit can inhabit the watch posts and thus, their first line of defense is nullified.$B$BYou must enter each tower and use the Torch of Retribution within their fortifications. Beware the elite sentry units of the Dark Irons, $N.
Objective: Set the North, South, East, and West Sentry Towers on fire by using the Torch of Retribution inside each of the buildings.
