I desired him to pillage the areas I gave him in return for some goods and information.$B$BHe is looking for the killer of Jade, the one who broke up our old crew some time ago, and now that he has fulfilled his end, I will do the same, I aint no rat, I keep my bond.$B$BThe person who organized the hit to break us up went by the name Wally Wisecrack, he now hangs out with those Syndicate Boys, though I am sure 'Slip' knows that. Once you tell 'Slip' this is the person who was behind it all, he will no doubt want revenge.
