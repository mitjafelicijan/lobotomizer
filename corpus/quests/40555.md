Title: The Search for the Grave
Description: These Grimtotem have been under our constant observation since they moved into Dustwallow. They are a nasty bunch, but I assure you, if it was them, we would already know. However, if this tauren the scouts spoke of really existed, we could ask about him in Brackenwall Village.$B$BIn theory.$B$BTensions with the Horde are high, and I don't want my men to see us negotiate with them. I had way too many deserters in recent months. You could try to find his grave. The tauren mummify their dead, but since he was the only one here, I doubt the ogres knew about it. Just search for a graveyard, or something like this close to Brackenwall. I doubt you will find anything, but it is the only lead we have.$B$BAnd let's hope Lieutenant Caldwell returns soon with some information about Reethe.
Objective: Find the grave of a tauren warrior close to Brackenwall Village.
