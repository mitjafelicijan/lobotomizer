Title: Searching for the Lost Satchel
Description: The troggs are not the only thing that interested Magatha in Ragefire Chasm. She has heard word that one of her servants, a Maur Grimtotem, found something peculiar while in the Chasm, but he never made it out to show her what. She'd like Maur's body found--if it still exists--and any signs of what he found while attempting to speak to the troggs.$B$BReturn to Magatha any items of interest, and I'm sure she would be very generous in her reward.$B$BAgain, seek the Chasm in the darkest areas of Orgrimmar.
Objective: Search Ragefire Chasm for Maur Grimtotem's corpse and search it for any items of interest.
