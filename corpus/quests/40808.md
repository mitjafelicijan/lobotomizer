Title: Havoc on the Battlefield
Description: Listen closely, $n. You will not be fighting alone out there, so show some spirit when you do. And do not dare return until you are crimson with their blood. I do not care if they are common laborers or peons, guards or shamans. Kill them indiscriminately. Bring havoc to the battlefield. Each Kaldorei death will be repaid tenfold, mark my words.$B$BWe will remember your name if you return from this alive, and if you fight with honor, $n. If not, then may Elune cast her gaze upon your body. Tor ilisar'thera'nal!
