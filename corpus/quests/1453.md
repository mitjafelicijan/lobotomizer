Title: Reclaimers' Business in Desolace
Description: There's work to be done in Desolace, $N. It's an atrocious place, befouled by centaur and other nasties. But if you're looking for a good week's honest work, then head there, meet with Kreldig Ungor, and tell him I sentcha.$B$BYou can find him holed up at Nijel's Point--it's a little cozy camp hidden in the mountains of northern Desolace. Just head east if you enter from the Stonetalon Mountains. It's easy to miss, so be on the lookout.
Objective: Speak to Kreldig Ungor in Desolace.
