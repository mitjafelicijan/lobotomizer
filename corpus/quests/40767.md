Description: Hey there pal, you mind lending a hand?$B$BWe got all sorts of trouble with these Venomflayers lurking in the area, hell they are already responsible for a few of our casualties. If you could do me a favor and rid the local jungle of a few of 'em, that'd make our lives a whole lot easier.$B$BYou can find them pretty much all over to the west, and south west, remove twelve of them, and return to me when you're done.
