Title: Digging Deeper
Description: If what Faldan said is true - and I trust his words - then this whole ordeal goes further than my initial assumption. While I am sure the Venture Co.'s violations against nature might not have been the catalyst for the spider's change in behaviour, they surely played a vital role in accelerating it. However, to verify this presumption, we need to gather more samples and ultimately, more evidence.$B$BMy brethren on top of Stonetalon Peak report of increasing hostility by the local spiders calling the Broken Cliff Mine their home. From what I can deduct, this is all too similar to what can be observed in the Windshear Crag.$B$B$n, please aid me again by bringing me the spiders' brains, more this time, eight samples shall be enough. I dare not think of the true reason behind it all - and frankly, I wish to be proven wrong. You can find the mine by turning westwards just before you reach Stonetalon Peak.
Objective: Collect 8 Deepmoss Lurker Brains for Maloran Oakbranch at Bael Hardul in Stonetalon Mountains
