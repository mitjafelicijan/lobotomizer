Title: The Old Church of Westfall IV
Description: A priest from Westfall huh? Well that is certainly familiar, there was only one church there, and I recall him having had all sorts of trouble, from brigands to thugs who threatened to end his life. The light can be testing at times, but no one should go through something like that.$B$BHe spent some time here in the Cathedral of Light before he moved on to Northshire Abbey, he helps out around there from time to time, he goes by the name Brother Neals.
Objective: Speak with Brother Neals at the Northshire Abbey in Elwynn Forest.
