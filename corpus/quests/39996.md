Title: Horde Defender's Axe
Description: I've gone over the plans for the weapon, and they are quite spectacular. It is not the most practical weapon, but it will strike fear in our enemies. The handle is to be made of bone. And not just any bone, but a huge strong bone.$B$BThe closest suitable source are the Kolkar, with their powerful long legs. Go to their territory, find a big enough Kolkar, and slay him.
Objective: Bring a Long Kolkar Bone to Nargal Deatheye at the Crossroads.
