Title: Dreamtonic
Description: I am afraid I cannot offer you our Dreamtonic recipe to be crafted independently. It was discovered by one that is no longer with us, and I do not have their permission to share such secrets to outsiders.$B$BI can however, offer Dreamtonic that was created by myself in exchange for your efforts here in Hyjal. Bring me a single Small Dream Shard in exchange for a single Dreamtonic. That should be a fair trade.
Objective: Gather 1 Small Dream Shard for Talona Gladeheart at Nordanaar in Hyjal.
