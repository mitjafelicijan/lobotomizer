Title: Digsite Deterioration
Description: I was sent here to get an estimate of the damage done, and it looks to be beyond salvage. The troggs have gone and smashed much of the track, rail and work that was done within that valley. If I am to send a report back I hope to atleast show some sign that it is recoverable, maybe that is where you can come in.$B$BThe trogg infestation needs to be dealt with before the real work can be done, head just past this tunnel 'ere, and clean them out, do some real good skullthumping, and return to me, aye?
Objective: Slay 7 Stonevault Pillager's and 7 Stonevault Brute's for Surveyor Bronzehorn at Redbrand's Digsite in the Badlands.
