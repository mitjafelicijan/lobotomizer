Title: The Fallen Ancient
Description: The Kaldorei Empire's vast influence once spanned across the entire world, before the cataclysmic event of the Sundering shattered our dominion. As a consequence, our sacred relics have found their way to the farthest reaches of the globe.$B$BRecently, there have been murmurs and whispers about the shattering of the Greymane Wall, which once separated the land of Gilneas from the outside world. While I hold little regard for the internal struggles of human kingdoms, it is noteworthy that Gilneas was once home to the ancient Wild God known as Zalmos. Sadly, Zalmos perished there during the devastating War of the Ancients.$B$BYour task is to journey to Gilneas and recover Fang of Zalmos, which is said to be held by an enigmatic order known as the Pellars of Witchwood. Unfortunately, further details are scarce, but your resourcefulness will undoubtedly guide you in uncovering the truth.
Objective: Venture to Gilneas and find the Witchwood Pellars.
