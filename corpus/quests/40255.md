Title: To Sorrowguard Keep
Description: A while ago a band of soldiers had departed out to the Swamp of Sorrows. They were tasked with the reclamation of an old keep that laid within the mountains near the western edge of the swamp. Paladin Janathos was the leader of this group, and asked me to say for him and his men a blessing.$B$BNo doubt they will need help out there and perhaps a fresh set of hands could be welcomed. Sorrowguard Keep should be just near the entrance to Deadwind Pass, infact it looms over it. It was once used to protect the kingdoms border, believe it or not.$B$BIf you see Janathos, tell him I said hello!
Objective: Report to Watch Paladin Janathos at Sorrowguard Keep in Swamp of Sorrows.
