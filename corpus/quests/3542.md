Title: Delivery to Andron Gant
Description: Andron Gant is my next contact. He usually holds himself up in the Undercity... right near the Apothecarium.$B$BHe was a little more loose-lipped when it came to speaking about what he wanted the Tablet for. Apparently some of the mages of Undercity are looking to study some of the arcane spells the highborne used. They think this tablet will help them. Markri was adept at summoning creatures; especially elementals.$B$BTake the Tablet of Markri and return to me for your part of the reward.
Objective: Bring the Tablet of Markri to Andron Gant in Undercity.
