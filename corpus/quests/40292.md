Title: Disturbance in the Air
Description: Hail, $C, do you feel it? The magic, crackling around us, ever powerful, even after thousands of years. This place used to be Zin-Azshari, capital of the Night Elf Empire.$B$BNow, its nothing more than a wasteland, occupied by the Naga or even more sinister forces. However, I had a vision, great disturbance comes to this place, and if we do not stop it, the consequences will be... dire.$B$BUnfortunately, my vision was unclear, enveloped in the mists. I need to enter a shamanistic trance to see clearly. Yet, I lack proper ingredients to enter such a state. I would gather them myself, but I cannot leave the outpost for now. I dont need much, only Mosshorn Antlers to pulverize, and a dozen Highborne Essence from the Highborne spirits.
Objective: Gather 5 Mosshorn Antlers and 12 Highborne Essences for Farseer Yhargosh at Bloodfist Point in Azshara.
