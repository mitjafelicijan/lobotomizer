Title: Training the Beast
Description: Unfortunately, this is where my knowledge ends, training these beasts isn’t really my forte. However, I know who can teach you these things. Ormak Grimshot in Orgrimmar’s Valley of Honor is much more qualified for that. You can catch a ride from Gazzik’s Workshop to Sparkwater Port, from there it's just a small walk up to the capital. I heard he spends most of his time near the Hall of the Brave.$B$BBest of luck to you, my friend! I’ll miss you and your glorious BOOMS dearly.
Objective: Speak with Ormak Grimshot in Orgrimmar.
