Title: Feran's Report
Description: Loruk may not like the news I am about to deliver to him. It is news of madness and chaos. Upon studying the hidden grove, I found crater marks from infernals and furbolgs enraged by corruption.$B$BIt seems the elven druids could not stop whatever lurks deep inside, and I did not risk my life to learn more. Whatever is inside of there certainly is powerful enough to corrupt the very forest. Take this report to Loruk. It has all of the details of my findings.
Objective: Bring Feran's Report to Loruk Foreststrider.
