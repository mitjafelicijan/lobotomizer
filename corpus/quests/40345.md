Title: The Way of Spiritwalking II
Description: The path of the spiritwalker is one of devotion to the ancestors, to keep in communication with the spirits of old. We are to respect them, and pay our tributes when we can, through this we are able to hone a power of the supernatural world.$B$BFrom the ravenous Centaur, to the vile Quilboar, even they practice elements of shamanism linking to their ancestry. It is almost entwined with Kalimdor itself, in a way.$B$BTo get you aquainted with the powers of the spirit world we will need you to gather an age-old leaf that grows in the area. Believe it or not there was a time when it was common place amongst Stonetalon and the oasis of the Barrens, but no longer.$B$BOut in the forests of Feralas grows a potent plant called Spiritleaf. It is quite rare but can be seen glittering in the air, and is needed for ones spiritual awakening.
Objective: Find and collect a Spiritleaf for Sage Palerunner in Camp Mojache.
