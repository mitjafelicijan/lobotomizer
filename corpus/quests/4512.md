Title: A Little Slime Goes a Long Way
Description: But the thing I've studied most is ooze. I know it sounds odd, but they're all over!$B$BI helped a lady in Menethil find her bag not too long ago--it was eaten by oozes. I've seen members of the Royal Apothecary Society from Undercity collecting samples of the stuff. I want to know why! Where does it come from?$B$BI've heard of more in Felwood. What I need are samples of the oozes there so I can further my research. I'll give you containers, you use them to collect a sample from the deceased creatures.
Objective: Bring 6 Filled Cursed Ooze Jars and 6 Filled Tainted Ooze Jars to Laris Geardawdle in Ironforge.
