Title: Farren's Proof
Description: Would you believe it, $n? Redpath wasn't satisfied with all the murlocs we killed--oh now, don't be modest, you had some hand in it. Now he wants me to bring proof of the dead, hacking off cold, slimy murloc heads to submit for his approval.
Objective: Collect 10 Murloc Heads from the murlocs on the Western Strand for Lieutenant Farren Orinelle in Southshore.
