Title: Taming the Beast
Description: The darkhound was but the first of your trials, hardly an appropriate test of your will. Nonetheless, you have earned some respect. The next beast you will subdue will not be so easily won over.$B$BThe duskbats of Tirisfal are large, gruesome beasts who were drawn here by the stench of death all around. They are capable of growing large enough to be used for transportation akin to the gryphons of the dwarves of Khaz Modan. Their screech can bring agony even to the undead, making them formidable foes.$B$BThis also makes them ideal allies. Every beast in this world has adapted its own unique means of fighting and defending itself. Fight beside them, learn from them, never hesitate to adapt so long as your mind still reigns over your diseased body. The beasts, too, will learn from you and adapt.$B$BStill, accepting such unnatural abberations as us may prove more difficult. Find a Greater Duskbat, exert your will, and bring it to me.
Objective: Use the Taming Rod to tame a Greater Duskbat. Practice your skills, then return the Taming Rod to Liott Maneskin in Brill.
