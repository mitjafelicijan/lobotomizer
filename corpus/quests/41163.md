Title: Battletron Calamity
Description: I was comissioned to make several combat robots for Taxxlo in order to fight the Venture Co. which began appearing on the island. Little did I know the very materials I was crafting these battletrons were themselves made by those we are fighting. Suffice to say that each and every one of our new combatants have fallen into a state of annoyance.$B$BTaxxlo tried to save some gold and put the entire island at risk, we were lucky they didn't outright turn on us. Regardless, we have to clean up this mess, and the aimless robots could still cause issues.$B$BYou can find most of them wandering just south of Rustgate Ridge to the west of here, destroy them so that they don't fall into the hands of our enemy.
Objective: Destroy 10 Faulty Battletron 1000's for Gazzik at Gazzik's Worshop on Blackstone Island.
