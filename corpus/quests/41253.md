Title: The Way of Fel
Description: Greetings. I am Leshandra Fintri, and my research delves into the more... unconventional methods of satiating our arcane addiction.$B$BTo the southwest lies a Blood Elf fortress. Blood Elves, notorious for handling their addiction differently than us, employ a distinct type of magic to quench their thirst. My endeavor is to glean more insights, but regrettably, the Regency Council opposes my research. If you could venture there and retrieve some Fel Crystals, I would compensate you generously for your efforts.
Objective: Retrieve 10 Fel Crystals from Felstrider Retreat for Leshandra Fintri in Alah'Thalas.
