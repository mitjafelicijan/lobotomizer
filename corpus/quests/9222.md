Title: Epic Armaments of Battle - Friend of the Dawn
Description: Greetings, friend. Have you insignias of the Dawn or the Crusade that you would like to redeem for items of great power?$B$BI must warn you; purchases made at a friendly reputation with the Dawn come with an extremely hefty surcharge. I would advise that you gain a better reputation with the Dawn before moving forward with your plans.
Objective: For 110 Insignias of the Dawn and 110 Insignias of the Crusade you may choose an item from the Argent Dawn's treasure cache.
