Title: Making a Statement
Description: Here mate, put Morgan's head in this Jolly Roger. Ye ain't about to like what ye're goin' to do next, but that shall only prove how insane 'n courageous ye be. Ye're goin' to toss the head at the feet o' the Baron 'n the First Mate 'n make a damn run fer it! Ye're gonna find us on Jaguero Island, I hope ye make it thar alive, ye'd be a great asset to the crew. If ye do come, I will officially make ye a crewmate.
Objective: Make a statement.(This action will make the Blackwater Raiders and Booty Bay your enemy, if your life is not expendable do not attempt this mission.)
