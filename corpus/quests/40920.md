Title: Hammering the Mystery Home
Description: Oh, what a pathetic little impersonation this is. Did you deliberately bring back the most amateur specimen you could find?$B$BSince you enjoy adding to your own list of tasks with your own sheer incompetence, then listen: the crystal needs its imperfections removed. This is no easy task, and very specialist tools will be required. Two hammers: One forged deep within Hateforge Quarry, and the other utilized by the Dark Irons of Blackrock Depths. Bring them to me, and your missteps may be forgiven.
Objective: Acquire a Hammer of Hate, and a Hammer of the Depths and bring them to the Mysterious Mailbox.
