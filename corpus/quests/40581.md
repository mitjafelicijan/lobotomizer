Title: Mysterious Shield No More
Description: You're saying this Tauren was supposed to be buried with his shield and there was no actual shield? I knew I had a weird feeling about this. This could only mean one thing and one thing only, someone came to rob our graveyard, for something that would incriminate the Horde if placed in the burned inn.$B$BBut who, and why? Give me a second to go through all of this.
Objective: Reassure Krog at Brackenwall Village by giving him a pat on the shoulder.
