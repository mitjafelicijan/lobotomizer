Title: Smashing the Southsea!
Description: The Southsea Pirates are a direct threat to our survival on this island. Their operations here are much larger than we had first anticipated when we set out. They still have many powerful vessels, and whilst they haven't attempted to sail them in front of our town, the possibility is still real.$B$BKul Tiras has always been at war with piracy. Those that threaten the merchants are a direct threat to our kingdom. I need you to claim the sashes of the Southsea Freebooters, a pirate gang that operates in a vast area. You can find them across both large islands and along the sandbar named after them to the southwest of here, off the coast of Lapidis.$B$BAs proof of your deeds, bring me twenty of the sashes that they wear. Your efforts will not only help us, but all who travel the vast sea.
Objective: Gather 20 Southsea Sashes from Southsea Pirates for Colonel Hardinus in Caelan's Rest.
