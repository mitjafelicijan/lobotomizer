Title: The Mighty U'cha
Description: While you have been exploring Un'Goro, I have seen other things that a mighty hunter such as yourself would relish in. One such sight was a huge ape among the other gorillas to the north. You have been to that cave before, but this time, I wonder if you'll survive the encounter if you accept my task.$B$BI call him U'cha, and he is one of the Earth Mother's greatest sons, of that you can be sure. Defeat U'cha and bring me his pelt. Do this, and I will defend your right to call yourself a great hunter.
Objective: Bring U'cha's Pelt to Torwa Pathfinder at the entrance of Un'Goro Crater.
