Title: The Storm Bay Mutiny
Description: I was sent to Azshara from the great depths of the world to claim ownership over these lands. I am royalty—royalty of the naga—and with my army, I could have been as strong as Queen Azshara!$B$BYet, here I am, ruling over a small band of my loyal followers with no sway or power in the world. I was betrayed by the naga that followed me, and you will help me get revenge. The Storm Bay Murlocs were that of my family's servants. Their betrayal is most foul to me. The creatures think they are above the will of Tide Mistress Rashal?$B$BYou can find these spineless followers all along the coastline of Azshara. Perhaps showing strength may help to get them back in line.
Objective: Kill 10 Storm Bay Warriors and 10 Storm Bay Oracles for Tide Mistress Rashal.
