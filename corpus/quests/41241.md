Title: All Around Alah'Thalas
Description: Are you here to perhaps lay eyes upon the undeniable future, or is it mere innocent curiosity? Maybe you're here to spit in our face as those who cast us aside in the muck and the rubble. Blessed be the sun, you wouldn't be here to take pity on our wretched souls, would you?$B$BYour pity we'll do without. However, you might prove useful. We require a task, one for such an eager ally as yourself. You wouldn't mind repurposing a few misplaced arcane crystals, would you? Our noble kin in the city, with their arrogance, leave them all around Alah'Thalas. I doubt they'd realize a handful went missing.
Objective: Retrieve 7 Arcane Crystals from around Alah'Thalas and return them to Ka'zmir Somberwind in the Wretched Ghetto.
