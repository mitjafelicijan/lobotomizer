Title: In Need of Ol' Biggins
Description: This magic is potent, but without the proper mechanical understanding of locks, you won't be able to open the most difficult locks in this world...$B$BPerhaps a talented rogue or master thief could help you with your dilemma. Rumors tell of a haven for rogues, assassins, and black operatives holed away between the mountains in northern Hillsbrad Foothills. No doubt such a service will not come cheap, however.
Objective: Find Ol' Biggins in the Ravenholdt Manor and pay him 3 gold coins for his tutelage.
