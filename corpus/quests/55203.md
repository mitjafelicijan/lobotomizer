Title: The Wood Arrives on Time!
Description: Hey there! I'm in a bit of a pinch, you see? The path between here and Menethil Harbor has remained fairly blocked up for quite a while now, and I gotta get this shipment to there soon.$B$BMenethil's Harbor has requested more lumber for repairs of their dockyard and we happen to be the closest lumber mill.$B$BI have no doubt if they don't get their lumber soon they will turn to someone else for wood.$B$BIf you could do me a favor, and take this shipment down toward Menethil Harbor and deliver it to James Halloran, it would mean the world to me, and keep us in good business!
Objective: Deliver the Lumber Shipment to James Halloran in Menethil Harbor.
