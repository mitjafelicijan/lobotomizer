Title: Foreman Pipelatch
Description: You there, kid! I got work orders and timeframes that I need completed around here, and those blasted Ashfeathers keep getting in the way. I need results, and I need them quick. Clear out the buzzard population around here so that my guys can work properly, and without interruption. The quicker you do some enforcing, the quicker I can get to finishing these overblown timetables.
Objective: Slay 10 Ashfeather Scavengers for Foreman Pipelatch at the Black Ash Coalpits on Blackstone Island.
