Title: Eight-Legged Menaces
Description: Hail, $c. Perhaps you've seen those spiders that have taken over the western border? The eight-legged menaces are too much for us to handle, and the Commander hasn't enough manpower to spare so far from Darkshire.$b$bI hate to ask this of you, but you seem like you might be able to handle them. I can't promise you anything of great value, but I can reward you if you can help root out the filthy bugs.$b$bOh, and a word of advice, you'll want to avoid their venom if you can.
Objective: Kill 15 Pygmy Venom Web Spiders, and then report back to Watcher Dodds in Duskwood.
