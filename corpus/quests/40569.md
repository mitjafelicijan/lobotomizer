Predicament.$B$BA connection to the void will be required, plus some sort of tonic that elicits lucid dreaming to bring forth this night-demon of yours, and banish it. My colleagues have whispered about a certain location that may just do the trick!$B$B<He smirks wickedly.> $B$BFire Scar Shrine. Name ring a bell? I doubt it. You can find it in Ashenvale, south west of Astranaar. There are foul beasts dwelling there, dog-like, ravenous and demonic. I need you to go there, kill them, and bring me their hearts. I will need one for you, but I never, ever work for free. Make it ten.
Objective: Go to Fire Scar Shrine in Ashenvale and gather the hearts of the demons described there for Gakin the Darkbinder at the Slaughtered Lamb in Stormwind City.
