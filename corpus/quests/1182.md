Title: Goblin Sponsorship
Description: See, the Venture Company shredders out in Lake Nazferiti (in northern Stranglethorn) have been equipped with a new model fuel regulator. I was thinking that Pozzik would be able to take advantage of it, if he could get some details. Unfortunately, Cozzle, the foreman out there, appears to be a little more clever than I gave him credit for.$b$bYou seem like you might have more luck finding the blueprints though. I know he keeps them in his house, but they're almost certainly under lock and key.
Objective: Bring the Fuel Regulator Blueprints to Baron Revilgaz in Booty Bay.
