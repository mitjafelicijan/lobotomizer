Title: Rooting Out Evil
Description: This report is chilling. Something is going on within the Crescent Grove, and it must be stopped. If we do not end the corruption, it could spread as far as Mulgore and beyond. We must do our part for the greater good of nature itself as druids.$B$BI must ask you to delve into the very depths of the Crescent Grove. You can find it to the southwest, near Mystral Lake. The cave entrance is just above the waterfall. There should be a pathway up. I recommend you find a band of those heroic enough to travel with you. There is no telling what lies ahead.
Objective: Venture into the Crescent Grove and root out the evil inside.
