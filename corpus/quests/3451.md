Title: Signal for Pickup
Description: Ah, so Tymor sent you, huh? Yeah, I owe him a favor or two. What's that? Why, that little devil. Yeah, I can help him out with that. So you'll need a flare gun and a location... easy enough.$B$BThere's a small island off the southern peninsula of Azshara that we've made a landing pad on. You take this flare gun, and use it there. I'll see your signal and come by to pick up this... whatever it is he wants.
Objective: Speak to Xiggs Fuselighter and get a Standard Issue Flare Gun from him in Ironforge.
