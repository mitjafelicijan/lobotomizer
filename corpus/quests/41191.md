Title: A Crown of Flowers
Description: Hey, you there!$B$B<Avenant lowers his voice, a sense of urgency in his tone.>$B$BFor a while now, I've had my eye on that lady over yonder. No need to turn and stare, mind you; subtlety is key. The catch is, she's not exactly warming up to my advances. Now, here's where you come in—I'm thinking a beautiful flower crown could work wonders, don't you agree?$B$B<Avenant glances around cautiously before continuing.>$B$BEmbarrassingly enough, I'm not exactly the bravest soul when it comes to venturing into the forest alone. Lynxes, spiders, you name it—I've seen them all, and it gives me the shivers. So, here's the deal: If you could gather some flowers for me, I might just stand a chance at winning the heart of that lovely lady. What do you say?
Objective: Bring ten flowers to Avenant so he can make a crown of flowers for Jolie.
