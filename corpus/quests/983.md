Title: Buzzbox 827
Description: Hey! Help me with my latest invention, the buzzbox. You can talk to people far away!$B$BMaybe you've already seen them, they're boxes with levers on them. The only problem is they need constant maintenance.$B$BEach one suffers from a different problem, but I made a really smart decision. I placed each one near creatures that have the proper parts to fix that particular machine. Right now Buzzbox 827 is on the fritz. It's just south of Auberdine, real close. It takes 6 Crawler Legs to fix it. I'll pay ya...
Objective: Collect 6 Crawler Legs and place them in Buzzbox 827.
