Title: The Unwise Elders
Description: The elders of the Foulweald were smart enough to leave once things had taken a turn for the worse. They helped lead the fleeing tribes of Furbolg into the Crescent Grove to the south. It is there that they slipped into madness and further drove the tribes under their watchful gaze into a deep craze. They are seen as spiritual leaders and the word of truth and a guide for the furbolgs there.$B$BTheir delusions and madness have only spurred the Groveweald to become an ever-greater threat to those around them and have led to even more misery to nature in Ashenvale. If the Groveweald is to be stopped, the Elders must cease their whisperings into the Grovetenders' ears. I doubt he will let you stop them, and he will also need to be destroyed. Bring me the paw of Elder 'One Eye' and Elder Blackmaw as proof of their demise, and you shall be rewarded for ending this cycle of destruction.
Objective: Bring the paws of Elder 'One Eye' and Elder Blackmaw from within the Crescent Grove to Grol the Exile.
