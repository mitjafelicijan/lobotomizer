Title: Devourer of Souls
Description: The time has come for you to learn more of the summoning magics. You will learn to summon a succubus, a creature of incredible mental powers. It can lull those of weak minds into its servitude--but have no fear! I feel certain that you will be equal to the challenge.$b$bA succubus can only be summoned when baited with an item that represents great devotion and love. I leave it to you to find such an object.$b$bA suggestion? Speak with Cazul... There seems to be little the ancient warlock does not know.
Objective: Speak with Cazul in the Cleft of Shadow.
