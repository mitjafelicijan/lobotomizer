Title: Shaking a Cold Arm
Description: With my Shredder fixed I can get back home and grab one of my dearest assistants to come aid the cause back in Sparkwater. Let Blastentom know I am coming, he better get a place for me to sleep ready and some good looking goblin babes.$B$BIt's gonna be fun to work on some new projects, yeah, especially if it's all against that ugly toad Razdunk, bleh.$B$BOh and do remind him, while I will be helping him, I don't owe anything to those Horde bastards!
Objective:  Report back to Nert Blastentom in Sparkwater Port.
