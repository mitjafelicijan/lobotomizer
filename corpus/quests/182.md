Title: The Troll Cave
Description: My brother Senir and I were sent to different parts of Dun Morogh to investigate the threat posed by the trolls. The Senate has its hands full with the troggs, so they've no need for further annoyances.$b$bFrom what I've seen, the trolls aren't well situated here in Coldridge Valley--mostly the southern cave. I'd say that the army will not be necessary. A few strong arms should be more than enough.$b$bPerhaps you'd like to assist in this endeavor? I have the authority to offer compensation for your help.
Objective: Grelin Whitebeard would like you to kill 14 Frostmane Troll Whelps.
