Title: Jasperlode Infestation
Description: Shortly after you returned from scouting the Jasperlode Mine, I received reports that a brood of spiders have been seen moving from Duskwood into the depths of the mine. Worse still, they're preying on the kobolds in the mine, giving them an abundant source of food with which to increase their population.$B$BKobolds, the Defias, and now spiders? We cannot afford to spread our forces any thinner to deal with yet another threat. Return to the Jasperlode Mine and clear out the infestation before they encroach upon the whole of Elwynn Forest!
Objective: Kill 8 Mine Spiders in Jasperlode Mine northeast of Goldshire, then return to Marshal Dughan in Goldshire.
