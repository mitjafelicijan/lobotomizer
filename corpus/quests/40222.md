Title: Intercepted Shipment
Description: Hey there, we don't get many visitors back here, I suppose you're looking for work then. I got a shipment I am expecting that should have arrived today, think you can pick it up? Let's just say, I'm not supposed to be seen around the docks to certain people.$B$BIt might not have my name on it, but it should be labeled as 'Refined Gem Shipment'. Try not to ask any questions while you're down there either, just grab the crate and come back. If you look like you know what you're looking for, and have confidence, they wont ask any questions.$B$BYou get me the crate, and I'll have more work for you.
Objective: Collect the 'Refined Gem Shipment' for 'Slip' in Booty Bay.
