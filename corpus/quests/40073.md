Title: Iron for Sorrowguard
Description: They promised that we would be well-supplied when we departed from Stormwind, only for us to be left out here with hardly anything to work with. What supplies we did receive, Watch Paladin Janathos paid forâ€”mostly out of his own pocket from shipments on the eastern coast. Ever since those shipments stopped, we have gotten nothing.$B$BYou can't imagine how hard it is to maintain equipment with such a small supply of iron that I have. If things keep up like this, I will run out, which means Sorrowguard will fall.$B$BI suppose that is where you come in. If you can procure me 20 iron bars, it will go a long way in keeping us in working order.
Objective: Gather 20 Iron Bars for Janet Hollowworth in Sorrowguard Keep.
