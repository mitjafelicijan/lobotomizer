Title: Food Improvision
Description: I manage the supplies here in Sorrowguard, and let me tell you, we are getting close to rationing. We keep and manage our supplies, and I make sure that we have a lock on most things, but the one thing we are coming short on is food. It would certainly mean a lot if you could help me improvise for the next coming while.$B$BThe jaguars in the area are probably the closest thing to an actual decent meal. Collect five Heavy Jaguar Flanks for me. They should do me well enough in keeping everyone sufficiently fed.
Objective: Collect 5 Heavy Jaguar Flanks from Swamp Jaguars in Swamp of Sorrows for Quartermaster Davin.
