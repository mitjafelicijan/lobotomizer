Title: The Binding
Description: By retrieving my choker and besting Surena, you've proven that you're at least as capable as she was.$b$bWith that said, I can tell you're direly in need of training. You can manage the flows of magic, yes, but being a warlock is much more than that.$b$bI will show you how to command a voidwalker, but before I can, you must call one forth at a summoning circle and subdue it using whatever weapons--physical and magical--you have at your disposal. Use the magic of this choker at the summoning circle below.
Objective: Using the Bloodstone Choker, summon and subdue a voidwalker, then return the Bloodstone Choker to Gakin the Darkbinder in Stormwind.
