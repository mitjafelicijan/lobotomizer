Title: 'Fair Trade' Is Not Legally Defined in Azeroth
Description: I'd be just delighted to send Vera more, except...well, darling, do you know how much fur we go through for the trimming? And not just any fur- genuine 100% free-range Alterac Yeti fur! It's the warmest. Unfortunately, we are all out and our suppliers are being difficult- something about a shortage and a snowman? Anyway, I- oh don't take this the wrong way, darling, but your outfit certainly makes a statement. And that statement is, oh, shall we say...'experienced in the art of combat.'$B$BI don't suppose you'd be a dear and just go to Alterac and fetch me some fresh yeti hides? The yetis may be a bit reluctant to part with their hides, but I'm sure you can manage. I'll need about ten of the finest, fluffiest, preferably cleanest furry hides.
Objective: Travel to the Atelier Serendipity shop in Stormwind Park and ask Alix Gres to send Vera Lauren a new shipment of clothes.
