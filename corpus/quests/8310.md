Title: Breaking the Code
Description: I think I can formulate an elixir that will allow us to more readily decipher the glyphs and language of the silithid and Qiraji! What do I need? Glad you asked! I need brains! More specifically, a brain from each silithid type that inhabit the hives. Bring me brains and Rutgar's work might not be for naught.
Objective: Frankal Stonebridge at Bronzebeard's Encampment in Silithus wants you to recover a Hive'Zora Silithid Brain, Hive'Ashi Silithid Brain, and a Hive'Regal Silithid Brain. Return to Frankal when you have completed this task.
