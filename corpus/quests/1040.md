Title: Passage to Booty Bay
Description: Ah yes, finally found it. Should have told me she passed through here that long ago. Let's see.$b$bVelinde. Booked passage to Booty Bay on the Black Osprey. I don't have anything here saying otherwise, so I'd assume it arrived in port safely.$b$bNot much more help I can be to you, but she asked about overland travel over on that side of the world, and I mentioned Ruzzgot, a caravan driver based out of Booty Bay. Might be that this Velinde traveled with him.$b$bMove along, now. I haven't all day for you.
Objective: Take a boat to Booty Bay and speak with Caravaneer Ruzzgot.
