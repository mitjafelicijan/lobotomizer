Title: Savage Flora
Description: I make a special type of armor for the brave heroes that enter Naxxramas known as Dreamwalker. They are able to provide me with most of the materials I require but I am always looking for those able to retrieve savage fronds from the flora of our world.$B$BYou may think of this job as beneath you, but without the fronds, the armor could not be made.$B$BI am also in a unique position to pay you with an insignia of your choice as both the Dawn and the Crusade supply me with funds.
Objective: Rayne at Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands wants 30 Savage Fronds.
