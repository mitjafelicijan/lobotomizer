Title: To Numb the Pain
Description: Enter, my child. You are welcome here amongst the restless dead. You likely know of the gifts we bestow upon our followers, so I shan't speak of it further.$B$BI chose to be a worgen, and have found much more power and knowledge in the curse than I ever did the life I left behind. Now I assist Lady Moranna with her research, which has sadly come to a stalemate. The venom I require comes from the Hollow Web spiders just to the east of this cemetery. It will be crucial for our new recruits to overcome the pain of their transition. Gather me ten vials. That should be enough.
Objective: Gather 10 Hollow Web Venom for Mother Tanya at Hollow Web Cemetery in Gilneas.
