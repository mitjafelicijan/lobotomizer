Title: A King's Plea
Description: I am Corthan, last of my name, Marauder-King of a fallen kingdom.$B$BDuring our last stand, my Keeper told me that even if we are to suffer the curse of undeath a day will come when one from future generations may stumble across us. I suppose he filled your mind with the promise of destiny and fate, but to my eyes, I only see this as a greater coincidence in the grand scheme of all things.$B$BYou do not strike me as a hero of legend or some great adventurer, and I am not particularly sure why you'd go to such lengths to aid us. Not that I am against it, and surely I am grateful. I suppose the seed of curiosity was planted and you truly wish to meet Zetharia, the one who could cause all this.$B$BNo matter how this turns out, you will be the last living being to ever lay eyes upon me. There is a book within this room, it contains our history. I wish for you to take it, and place it somewhere to be remembered.
Objective: Collect The History of Corthan from the crypt where Corthan rests.
