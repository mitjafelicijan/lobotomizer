Title: A Royal Heist
Description: I don't like questioning the boss, but I think he's beginning to lose his mind. We're meant to be thieves, yet where's the money, the treasure, the joy and rush of stealing, looting, and pillaging?$B$BI can't persuade Blackthorn to let me and some other brigands raid the city, but you have a bit more leeway. All I need you to do is head to Gilneas City's library and steal the portrait of Mia Greymane. We'll divide up the spoils.
Objective: Steal the painting from the library in Gilneas City and return to Luke Agamand at Blackthorn's Camp in Gilneas.
