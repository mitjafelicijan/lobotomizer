Description: You've done some good work, $n, best I've seen from an amateur.$b$bLady Proudmoore asked that I keep her apprised of this delicate situation, and I haven't spoken to her for some time now.$b$bI was going to deliver my report to her later, but it seems more fitting that you should be the one to speak with her about it. You can probably answer her questions better than I could.
Objective: Bring Vimes's Report to Lady Jaina Proudmoore in Theramore.
