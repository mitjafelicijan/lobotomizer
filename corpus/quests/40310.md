Description: There is only one step left for us, as honorable members of the Horde. We must step forth into the darkness, and vanquish this evil before it grows even stronger. If we were to let the humans deal with this, who knows if they could even stop it?$B$BAs Grom Hellscream slayed Mannoroth, we too must look upon something terrible and destroy it from this world. I ask of you to venture into the Karazhan Crypts, and put an end to this madness, for the good of this world.$B$BThis will not be a task you can handle alone, make sure you bring strong allies to journey with you.
Objective: Venture forth into the Karazhan Crypts, once inside slay Alarus, the watcher of the Crypts for Kor'gan in Stonard.
