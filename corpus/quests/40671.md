Title: A War Worth Fighting
Description: There are few things I loathe more than needless war, $N. It might be an irony to you, for the title I bear, but I saw what horrors wake in men and women when ashes and bloodshed are all that is left of their lives.$B$BI led my people to Kalimdor because I wished to give our children a better world to grow into. I believe that world is still within reach: Woe betide anyone that would threaten it!$B$BI have sent envoys to treat peace with Alverold, to make him see sense. Return to Dar'nakk, and if Alverold refuses... it can only be victory or death.
Objective: Report back to Warbringer Dar'nakk in Razor Hill.
