Title: Shard Harmonization
Description: We must all do our part here in Hyjal, and my part is to harmonize Small Dream Shards into Bright Dream Shards. The harmonization process makes the shards much more potent in regards to their magical properties. If you have any work that you need me to do, bring me three Small Dream Shards, they can be found around Hyjal, or no doubt earned by those in town for tasks in maintaining Nordrassil.
Objective: Collect 3 Small Dream Shards for Lantho Talonmoon at Nordanaar in Hyjal.
