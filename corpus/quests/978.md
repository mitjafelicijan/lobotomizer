Title: Moontouched Wildkin
Description: Wildkin feathers from the Hinterlands appear to contain traces of magical qualities. These powers... they don't seem to be wielded by the creatures, it's more like they are simply inherent to the species -- part of their very essence.$B$BDuring my studies, I heard that a large population of wildkin inhabit the snowy lands of Winterspring. Could these creatures have the same powers? Please help me find an answer, $N. Go to Winterspring and gather feathers that have dropped to the ground, then return to me.
Objective: Collect 10 Moontouched Feathers from Winterspring, then return to Erelas Ambersky in Rut'theran Village.
