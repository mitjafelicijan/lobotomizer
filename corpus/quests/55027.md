I'll honor that "favor" that he is calling it, but I need something done.$B$BThe Venture Co. has been causing some issues around here, mostly in taking up my trade and getting some of it for themselves. That's where I need you to come in and be discreet.$B$BThey've been messing with some of my operations, and I want to mess with some of their own, in secrecy of course.$B$BTravel far to the north-east by Lake Nazferiti. I've got it from reliable sources that they are setting up an oil platform there, kill some of the Mechanics they contracted to work on it. That should cost them a lot of time and money.
Objective: Kill 5 Venture Co. Mechanics at the Oil Platform near Lake Nazferiti.
