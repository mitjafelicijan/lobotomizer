Title: The Depths of Karazhan IV
Description: My my... Such potent energy, I had always guessed that Karazhan had natural ley energy, infact it was rumored within Dalaran. Kor'gan was correct to bring these samples to me, they will make good for future projects. The energy that lingers beneath the arcane is that of necromancy, and quite potent necromancy at that.$B$BLong ago I spent quite some time at Karazhan, I was under mission from the Kirin Tor to look into the natural energy that lingered there. This is no doubt the work of Alarus, a student of Medivh for a brief period of time, he spent much of his later days attending to the Crypts that stretched far beneath the tower.$B$BIf your task is to enter those catacombs, you will need to reforge the key. It requires a Mark of Karazhan, held by few who were given entrance into the tower, as well as the key itself.$B$BBring this information to Kor'gan, perhaps he will find a solution to this problem.
Objective: Return to Kor'gan in Stonard with the information given by Gunther Arcanus.
