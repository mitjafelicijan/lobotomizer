Title: Grand Theft Shredder
Description: All right, shrink ray is done.$B$BYou're probably wondering why we need a damn shrink ray to kill that doofus Higgle, right? Well, we don't. Call this a pet project of mine. You're gonna go back into those fields, find the B-33 Shredder and beat it around a couple of times. Once the pilot is dead, it should automatically begin shrinking, just pick it up!$B$BDo. NOT. DAMAGE. IT$B$BJust wanted to make clear, after you beat it up real good, you'll use the shrink ray, pocket it up, and come back to me. While you cause this commotion, I have a friend of mine finding the location of their boss.
Objective: Steal B-33 Shredder and bring it back to Senior Foreman Nazz Firecracker at Powder Town in Stonetalon Mountains.
