Title: In Search of Corruption
Description: There was a time in which the Kaldorei and the Furbolgs lived in harmony, they were our ally against the darkness, and worked with us to keep the balance in nature. We traded, we offered assistance to one another, and we even fought aside one another.$B$BThat time has passed, and it seems with each passing day more and more furbolg abandon their homes to join the larger tribes. These large tribes of furbolg have collected to gather strength and deem the outside world as hostile entirely.$B$BIn the end, they have become nothing but ruthless stalkers, murderers and agents of madness. This change has only puzzled us druids, and has brought up more questions then answers. Hopefully today we can find some. Across the water to the north are some of their camps, abandoned by their kind. I want you to search them, and try to find some clues as to why they would potentially be corrupted.
Objective: Search the furbolg camps across the water for clues of their corruption.
