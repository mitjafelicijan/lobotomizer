Title: Dragons of Azshara?
Description: During my vision, I saw a great Dragon, flying over Azshara. I don't know much about them, but our Druid friends here in Bloodfist Point should be more knowledgeable. Share my vision with them, they will know what to do next.
Objective: Tell Talom Stridecloud about the Farseer's vision.
