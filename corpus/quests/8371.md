Title: Concerted Efforts
Description: We're not fighting isolated battles against the Horde anymore, $g lad:lass;.$B$BVictory in one front means denying the Horde resources they'd use against us in a different battle.By the same token, losing any given battle could give the advantage to our opponent somewhere else around the world.$B$BThe Alliance is in need of more combatants with this sort of worldly understanding... truly seasoned veterans!$N, come back to me after you've served against the Horde at all of our active battlegrounds.
Objective: Bring 3 Alterac Valley Mark of Honor, 3 Arathi Basin Mark of Honor and 3 Warsong Gulch Mark of Honor to an Alliance Brigadier General outside the battlegrounds.
