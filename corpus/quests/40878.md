Title: All We Need is Blood
Description: I have come to this land in search of a particular book - a tome I have sought for ages: 'On the Powers of Blood' by Archmage Ur. Oh, how it eluded me! But now, I have reason to believe that it may be hidden within Gilneas. $B$BThe knowledge contained within those pages could be invaluable to furthering both the goals of the Forsaken and the Horde. I am close to discovering its whereabouts, very close, but in the meantime I require your assistance. Take these vials and collect the blood of bats. We will need them for our plans, yes. Do not disappoint me.
Objective: Bring 10 Vilewing Blood Vials for Orvan Darkeye at the Ruins of Greyshire in Gilneas.
