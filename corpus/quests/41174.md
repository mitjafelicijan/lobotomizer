Title: Workplace Hazard
Description: The state of Blackstone is much worse than I had anticipated. When I first was asked to come to this island and produce some mining robots to help with the workload, I was more than happy to see the progress here.$B$BWhat I found instead was a hostile work environment and not even enough materials to do a good enough job for my contract. Now I'm stuck here, held hostage until I get the problem sorted out. You see, I was given terrible materials to work with and as the copper wires decayed, so too did my Mine-Bots. Now they just wander aimlessly around the island.$B$BDo you think you could do me a massive favor? Find those malfunctioning Mine-Bots and destroy them for me. Apparently, they are causing a workplace hazard. You should be able to find them around the island, but most were sent to work at the Black Ash Mine to the north of here.
Objective: Slay 8 Malfunctioning Mine-Bots for Technician Reyvo at Rustgate Ridge on Blackstone Island.
