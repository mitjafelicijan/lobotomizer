Title: Scrounging
Description: It's going to be tough going here if I can't manage to scrounge up some materials to construct some defenses and other necessities. I've noticed that the ogres in the area seem to be well equipped with scrap metal. Maybe the stories of siege engines in the Badlands weren't so far off after all...$b$bAnyways, the Prospector's been getting worried about the state of our little camp, so I'd like to get working soon if I can.$b$bThe main ogre camp is at Dustbelch Grotto, a good trek to the west of here.
Objective: Get 7 pieces of Scrap Metal for Sigrun.
