Title: Horde Defender's Axe
Description: I was supposed to craft a powerful new weapon for our brave warriors. A weapon that will inspire fear in the enemy upon first sight. Why am I sitting idly instead of working on it, you ask?$B$BUnfortunately, the plans for this weapon were stolen before they reached the Crossroads. The orc carrying the plans did not survive the attack, but perhaps somebody else witnessed it and can identify the perpetrators.$B$BAsk the guards around the Crossroads if they saw who it was. We must recover those plans.
Objective: Speak with a Horde Guard in The Crossroads
