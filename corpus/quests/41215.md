Title: Whispers of Autumn
Description: To the west, there lies the Island of Eternal Autumnâ€”a nearly forgotten legend among our people. Millennia ago, in the earliest days of our arrival on these shores, there were those among us who endeavored to plant a new World Tree. Alas, the endeavor failed, and the cursed tree wrought a transformative spell upon the entire land, condemning it to an eternal autumn. Neither able to perish nor truly flourish, the island became a testament to a past ambition gone awry.$B$BI ask you to embark upon a journey to this mystic isle and procure a primal heart from the treants that now inhabit it. Your efforts will not go unrewarded.
Objective: Acquire a Thalasian Primal Heart from Autumnal Treants for Calhir Dawnchaser in Anasterian Park.
