Her relationship with the spirits of water has always been strong. Our task being a noble one should be enough to persuade her and the spirits of water to aid us in this task.$B$BYou should find her at a small camp right along the water's edge. And, $N, ignore the pirates... they are but a nuisance and no threat to you.
