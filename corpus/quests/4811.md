Title: The Red Crystal
Description: Hostile moonkin roam in ever increasing numbers to our east.They once were thought to be gentle, almost mystical creatures.While some continue to hold reverence for them, the safety of Auberdine forces me to keep a more realistic view.$B$BI've received reports that moonkin are being drawn to a large red crystal along Darkshore's eastern mountain range.No one has any idea what that crystal is, or even if it really exists.I want you to locate it over there and report back to me what you find.
Objective: Travel east of Auberdine and look for a large, red crystal along Darkshore's eastern mountain range.Report back what you find to Sentinel Glynda Nal'Shea in Auberdine.
