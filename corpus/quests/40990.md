Title: The Runestone Scepter
Description: <The creaking ancient lets out a grumble.>$B$BIt would appear Buthok has proven successful in re-energizing the Runestone of Cenarius. Though, there is one last problem that still offers trouble.$B$BYou see, I once charged a druid named Enthelar Valebranch with overseeing the Runestones some years ago. The Runestone Scepter, which activates the magic was in his possession when he succumbed to the whim of corruption.$B$BLast I heard, Enthelar Valebranch was seen wandering Winterspring, his mind addled, and lost. Recover the Runestone Scepter, and I will grant you access to the Runestones of Hyjal.
Objective: Recover the Runestone Scepter from Enthelar Valebranch, last seen wandering Winterspring for Glanthas the Ancient at Nordanaar in Hyjal.
