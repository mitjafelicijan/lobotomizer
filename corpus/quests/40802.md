Title: The Outrider
Description: Very well $n, let us break this deadlock immediately. From this moment forwards, the Horde will be our prey! The first thing to do with a prey animal is to isolate it from the rest. Make it blind, deaf and dumb. We need to disrupt the communications of the invaders from the rest.$B$BThere is an outrider who diligently passes messages from the lumber camp to their outposts, and likely beyond into the dusty deserts they call home. Lay an ambush, $n. Lie in wait by the road just south of here, north of the lumber camp. And when she passes by, strike her down. Show no mercy, for none will be shown to you.
Objective: Kill the Warsong Outrider that patrols the road south of Forest Song for Brolthan Ironglade.
