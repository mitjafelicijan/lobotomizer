Title: Well of Corruption
Description: Some may say that I am exceptionally cruel... But truly, it is only a strong desire to see the Horde gain an advantage against the Alliance, in any way possible.$B$BMy newest interest is a moonwell at the Ruins of Constellas, south of here, tended by the Jadefire satyrs. The moonwell, once a symbol of renewal for the insufferable night elves, is now corrupted, and used to bring forth more satyrs.$B$BI have an idea, $N, and I'd like a sample of the water... for my little feline friend here.
Objective: Collect a sample of corrupted water from the Jadefire Satyrs' moonwell and bring it to Winna Hazzard at Bloodvenom Post.
