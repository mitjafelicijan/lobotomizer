Title: Seal of Ascension

Finally, Overlord Wyrmthalak, master of the lower citadel, must forge the seal in the flames of the Black Dragonflight.$B$BUnderstand this, mortal: the chance that one of the three generals of the lower citadel would carry a gemstone at any given time is rare. You must be vigilant in your quest. Remain determined!

Return them, along with the Unadorned Seal of Ascension, to Vaelan.$B$BThe Generals, as told to you by Vaelan, are: War Master Voone of the Smolderthorn; Highlord Omokk of the Spirestone; and Overlord Wyrmthalakof the Bloodaxe.
