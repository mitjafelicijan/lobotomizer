Title: Weapons of Choice
Description: The Razormane quilboars to the south, beyond the Field of Giants, have no skilled blacksmiths from what I am told, but they've apparently started to develop sturdier weapons. I'd like to get my hands on a few different types to learn their techniques if possible.$B$BIf you wish to help bring honor to the Horde, then bring me examples of their weapons. Find me a dagger from their stalkers, a wand from their seers, and a shield from their warfrenzy. That should do nicely!
Objective: Bring a Razormane Backstabber, a Charred Razormane Wand and a Razormane War Shield to Tatternack Steelforge at Camp Taurajo in the Barrens.
