Title: Purified Dream Essence
Description: I must admit, I am quite nostalgic about working with Dream Essence once again. It has been many long decades since I have had the delight. To restore this sample, I require the following materials that can be found around azeroth.$B$BFrom here in Hyjal, I require ten Bright Dream Shards. Twenty-five Dream Dust needs to be acquired from anyone who can disenchant. Finally, I will need fifteen Living Essence, which can be somewhat tricky to come across. Bring these to me, and you shall be rewarded with the Emerald Blessing.
Objective: Collect 10 Bright Dream Shards, 25 Dream Dust, and 15 Living Essence for Arch Druid Dreamwind at Nordanaar in Hyjal.
