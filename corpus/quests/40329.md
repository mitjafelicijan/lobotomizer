Title: Pristine Gorrila Pelt
Description: We got a contact who has been looking to buy a Pristine Gorilla Pelt for some time now. They're paying top dollar for one completely pristine with not a single imperfection. The Bloodsail could certainly use the coin to fund our operations.$B$BHead out into the jungles of Stranglethorn and hunt down some of the gorilla, and find me a pristine pelt. We may as well utilize the jungle while we are here afterall.
Objective: Slay Gorillas in Stranglethorn Vale and collect a Pristine Gorilla Pelt for 'Wincing' Willy at the Bloodsail Compound.
