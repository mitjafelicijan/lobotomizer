Title: Flight to Auberdine
Description: From Rut'theran, there are two methods of travel to Auberdine: by ferry and by hippogryph.Both are quick and reliable, but if you have not yet flown to Auberdine by hippogryph, then I suggest you do.$B$BIt is sound advice to speak with the hippogryph master in every town that has one.Once you speak to the master, you can then fly there from other towns.$B$BHere is Nessa's collection.Speak with me again when you are ready to fly to Auberdine and deliver Nessa's collection to Laird.
Objective: Ride a hippogryph to Auberdine from the hippogryph master Vesprystus, then bring Nessa's Collection to Laird.
