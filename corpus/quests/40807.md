Title: Pressure is the Key
Description: A new face around these parts, ishnu-alah. My name is Commander Starwind, and normally I would be out on patrol somewhere or training with my sister sentinels but... unfortunately, I am stuck here trying to convince that pig-headed, cowardly druid Ironglade to assist us with the war on our doorstep. To think that would even require a conversation! The Horde fell our ancient trees, befouling Elune's beauty. Naturally many of us are already locked in combat, and someone - or something - needs to break this deadlock. It pains me to say that we are losing lives hour by hour.$B$BMaybe you can talk some sense into him, or perhaps if you are capable enough, join us in war? I am sure you will be well rewarded if so.
Objective: Listen to what Commander Starwind and Brother Brolthan have to say. Make a choice on the best course of action. Siding with one will likely make the other unreceptive to you.
