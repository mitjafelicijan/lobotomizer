Title: Bashal'Aran
Description: The ruins of Bashal'Aran to the east are overrun with demonic minions. The sprites and satyrs that have taken up residence in the area feed upon the magical energies of the area, their powers growing from continued exposure.$b$bEven with that, I have noticed that there is one shrine they will not approach. On the western side of the ruins, atop a small bluff, a strange blue aura permeates... There must be an explanation to the demons' reluctance.$b$bI would like you to investigate it.
Objective: Find the source of the strange blue aura in the ruins of Bashal'Aran.
