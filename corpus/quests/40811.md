Title: The Price of Cowardice
Description: You claim how many Horde kills to your name? Very impressive indeed, $n. There is one thing that concerns me, though, even during what should be a jubilant period. This Brolthan Ironglade, the one coordinating the druids in the area, the report states he refused to help at all? Cowardice it claims in here, but I worry there is something far worse than cowardice involved here.$B$BYou see, that druid is staunchly loyal to Arch Druid Fandral Staghelm. And we do not exactly see eye to eye. He would not have acted this way without some assurance or support from Darnassus, I imagine. Which means he knowingly endangered Kaldorei lives in order to, what, prove a political point?$B$BPlease, deliver this message to him. Frankly I think it is better than he deserves, but I will leave his fate to Elune to decide., And $n, do not forget to ask the commander for a reward afterwards!
Objective: Bring Tyrande's Message to Brolthan Ironglade at Forest Song in Ashenvale.
