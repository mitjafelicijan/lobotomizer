Title: Boat Wreckage
Description: Running your hand along the mud, your fingers graze the handle of a knife.It looks well cared for, and it might be safe to assume that whoever was on the boat might have lost it.Perhaps the large chunk of the missing boat might have something to do with the loss.$B$BYou grab the knife, remembering that Ginro Hearthkindle in the Feathermoon Stronghold instructed you to return to him with any found clues.You get the feeling, however, that you are not quite alone in the water...
Objective: Return to Feathermoon Stronghold and show Ginro Hearthkindle the Discarded Knife you have found.
