Title: The Balance of Power
Description: It has been a long time since we did battle with the Kul Tiran's in such a manner. Tiragarde never really posed such a major threat, but the news coming to my hall is worrying.$B$BLieutenant Alverold is the one who leads their Expedition Fleet, and it is he I wish to direct my attention. In the past, Admiral Proudmoore was not willing to discuss in terms of diplomacy, and I do not think his loyal Lieutenant will either.$B$BMy concern is not with these foreigners, but with the Alliance, for I do not know their standing with Kul Tiras, the last I heard an embassy opened in Stormwind. The last thing we want is an all out war between our factions.$B$BI must know more before I directly engage and I would trust you to speak with an agent in Ratchet that goes by the name 'Mally O'Flor', he is a human.
Objective: Find and speak with Mally O'Flor to decipher the relationship between Kul Tiras and the Alliance on behalf of Thrall.
