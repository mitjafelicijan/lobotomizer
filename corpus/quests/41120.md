Title: Legend of Dawnstone
Description: Aye, laddie! Have ye heard of the legendary Dawnstone Ore? It's a tale of epic proportions, that is! Used to forge armor for our brave paladins durin' the Second War. Those were glorious days indeed!$B$BBut let me tell ya, it's a scarce find, that it is! Only one place in this whole wide world where it can be dug up â€“ a mine hidden beneath Gilneas City. Aye, there is a curse or somethin' down there, somethin' mysterious that brought this precious ore to the surface. And by the beard of my father, I don't reckon I'd be wantin' to know the true nature of it.$B$BYou see, the Greymane Gate's been opened once more, and the political mess in Gilneas has left that mine likely abandoned. So, I'm thinking of gatherin' it for my clients in Undermine. If you can get your hands on twelve hefty chunks of Dawnstone Ore for me, I'll be more than willin' to share some percent of the profits with you. Now, what say ye? Do we have a deal?
Objective: Bring 12 chunks of Dawnstone Ore to Kurnen Oathbrace in Booty Bay. The ore can be found only in Dawnstone Mine in Gilneas.
