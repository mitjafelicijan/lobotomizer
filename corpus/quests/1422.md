Title: Threat From the Sea
Description: While I begin work on your weapon, why don't you talk to Katar? He mentioned needing help with patrols along the beach, and I'd rather see you keep your wits and weapons prepared instead of getting drunk with some of the other louses I share this camp with.
Objective: Speak to Katar in the Swamp of Sorrows.
