Title: Harness of Chimaeran
Description: Allow me to share a tale from antiquity. Millennia ago, a momentous pact was forged between the Kaldorei and the chimaeras. In those ancient times, there existed a remarkable figure known as Chimaeran. He possessed the rare ability to not only train these noble creatures but also ride upon their backs with unparalleled grace.$B$BHowever, tragedy struck during a brutal war with the Maraudine Centaur, for they plundered Chimaeran's legendary harness. Though the centaurs may no longer hold it, reports suggest that it still resides deep within the labyrinthine depths of Maraudon. Yet, beware, for other sinister forces, such as the malevolent satyrs, may now be the custodians of this precious artifact.$B$BI implore you, venture forth into Maraudon and reclaim the lost harness. Its recovery would hold profound significance for the legacy of chimaera trainers and honor the ancient bond that once united our kind.
Objective: Retrieve the Harness of Chimaeran from Maraudon and bring it back to Velos Sharpstrike at Chimaera Roost Vale in Feralas.
