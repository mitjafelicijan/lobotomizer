Title: Horde Defender's Axe
Description: I did not witness the attack itself,  but I did see something suspicious while patrolling the road. A group of human soldiers was heading south east. They were mounted, so I could not catch up to them.$B$BI suspect they killed the orc you speak of, and then returned to Northwatch Hold with the loot. Perhaps you should start your search there. I would come with you if I could, but I must remain at my post.
Objective: Bring the Stolen Weapon Plans to Nargal Deatheye at the Crossroads.
