Title: Cleansing the Roost
Description: If we are to embark on the path of training new chimaeras, we must first clear this roost of its current inhabitants. As magnificent as those soaring creatures may be, they are beyond the point of training and cannot serve our purpose.$B$BTo truly mold an obedient and loyal companion, we must start from their earliest days. Therefore, I ask of you to take up your arms and eliminate eight of the Dunebound chimaeras and eight of the Venomlash chimaeras that roam these skies. Once we've cleared the way, our true work can commence.
Objective: Slay 8 Dunebound Chimaera and 8 Venomlash Chimaera for Velos Sharpstrike at Chimaera Roost Vale in Feralas.
