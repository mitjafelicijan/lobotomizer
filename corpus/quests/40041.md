Title: Flaxwhisker Loyalty
Description: If you're the real deal, then you gotta do a real task. That makes sense, yeah? I've been dying to get my hands on a Mistwing Horn for some time! Those creatures are quite powerful and supercharged with all sorts of natural energy. I've had my suspicions for some time, now, that a Mistwing Horn could be useful beyond its practical purposes, and I'd like to put it to the test. That's where you come in.$B$BThe Mistwing can be found to the northwest, just beyond Lake Mennar. Be careful, though. There is all manner of big and powerful things up there! Azshara sure is a dangerous place.
Objective: Obtain a Mistwing Horn for Gigno Flaxwhisker to prove your loyalties.
