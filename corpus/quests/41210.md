Title: Durotar Labor Beginnings
Description: Why hello there kid, did you know that the Durotar Labor Union started out here in Stonetalon Mountains? Nert Blastentom himself used to work for the Venture Company, only to up and leave.$B$BWhile that makes for a good story it doesn't help the fact that Stonetalon itself has become a large hotbed of Venture Co. activity. They've even begun to investigate what exactly happened in that little valley where it all kicked off. The Durotar Labor Union needs to cover our tracks as best as we can and that requires some mercenary work to ensure they don't figure anything out. Travel to the Venture Camp just northeast of Powder Town. Leave Powder Town eastward, and then continue north until you find the pathway that heads through the mountains there. Once you're there, slay them, and recover Venture Company Evidence, then return to me, simple.
Objective: Recover the Venture Company Evidence from the Venture Camp to the northeast of Powder Town and return to Galmo Tazzwrench in Stonetalon Mountains.
