Title: An Azure Scale for Gnomeregan!
Description: When Gnomeregan first sent us here, they tasked us to obtain an Azure Scale from the Blue Dragonflight. Sadly, we have not had the means to do so!$B$BWe've been too busy with other projects, and—well—we didn't want to stir the hive. Especially since we don't have any actual military capabilities! Now with you around, there is a possibility!$B$BThe Dragonflight has gathered around Lake Mennar to the northwest. Get me an Azure Scale from the Blue Dragonflight, and make sure to bring buddies.$B$BI'd hate to have you die on my account!
Objective: Gather an Azure Scale for Blimo Gadgetspring.
