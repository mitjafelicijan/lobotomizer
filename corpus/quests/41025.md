Title: Manifestation Similarities
Description: My research in Azshara has yielded interesting information, though I still need to conduct research here in the Eastern Plaguelands. I have been attempting to find a link between magic and the Oozes themselves, but so far it would appear I have no luck. I have come to the conclusion that these creatures have been here for quite a while, and thus their magical potency has diminished.$B$BI ask of you to find an Imbued Sludge, one that contains a trace of magical energy. You can find the monstrosities near Light's Hope Chapel and Corin's Crossing here in the Plaguelands.
Objective: Gather an Imbued Sludge from the Oozes in Eastern Plaguelands for Canos Clearwood near Lake Mereldar.
