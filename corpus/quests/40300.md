Title: A Secret Admirer
Description: Hail young $c. Are you by chance destined for the human city of Stormwind? If so, I have a favor to ask.$B$BFishing is a rare choice of occupation among my kinsmen, but one I take a great deal of pleasure in. Truly there is no more relaxing way to pass the time, something we Kaldorei are in no short supply of. I often gather clams from the banks I fish along, containing pearls as pure white as Elune herself on the darkest night.$B$BIt is from these pearls I have put together a necklace for Shailiea, the woman I have been pining for and courting for many decades now. Please, deliver to her this necklace and tell her it is from her secret admirer. Let me quickly wrap this in a piece of cloth.$B$BThe quickest way to reach Stormwind would be from the south dock in Auberdine. Once in Stormwind, you should be able to find Shailliea residing in the Park.
Objective: Deliver Androl's Package to Shailiea in Stormwind City.
