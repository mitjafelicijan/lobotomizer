Title: Paragons of Power: The Demoniac's Wraps
Description: Warlocks tread dangerous ground in dealing with demons, but our demoniacs take this one step further.Through an ancient and arcane ritual, they allow a demon to enter their being.Rather than let it possess them though, they enslave the demon from the inside, absorbing the power of the beast for their own command.It is a feat few are ever able to master.$B$BFor you to learn of the power of the demoniac, I must have Paragons of Power from Zul'Gurub.Go there and retrieve that which we seek.
Objective: Bring Al'tabim the All-Seeing a Primal Hakkari Stanchion.You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Friendly with the Zandalar Tribe.$B$BAl'tabim the All-Seeing is located on Yojamba Isle, Stranglethorn Vale.
