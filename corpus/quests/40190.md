Title: The Blazno Touch
Description: You see, to be smart like me requires thinking outside of the box, something that goblins and gnomes have been in forever - a box! But me, I'm outside of it, and now with this turtle shell I can make great things happen!$B$BThe last step for what I need will require a single golden bar, the sheer properties of the gold will be enough to make pure magic happen, and when I say magic I mean MAGIC. You can find a gold bar anywhere on Azeroth, but I need a real one, not no fake crap!$B$BGet me a golden bar, and I will be able to remake my fortune!
Objective: Gather a Gold Bar for Blazno Blastpipe on Gillijim's Isle.
