Title: Daydreaming at Night
Description: Okay, okay, I know it looks bad. But Bert has been suffering with sleep paralysis of a very interesting kind, you see. The poor soul has something, and I have my suspicions what, reaching out to him during his dreams. I was skeptical too, until I witnessed it myself while observing him slumber.$B$BI am sure it is a demon! The peasants have countless stories of this sort of thing, but it's the first time I've gotten irrefutable evidence of it happening! Regardless, my studies must be put on hold, if his marriage and, if you are correct, his life may be in danger.$B$BThis demon must be either expelled or brought into the physical plane, then killed. Unfortunately, I have very little idea how to do so directly. $B$BBut I know who does. I made contact with a shady fellow in Stormwind. He conducts his business from a cabal hidden away in the basement of a tavern there. I do not know which one unfortunately. His name is Gakin the Darkbinder.$B$BPlease, hurry, $C. Bert isn't a perfect man, but he doesn't deserve this.
Objective: Find Gakin the Darkbinder in the basement of a tavern at Stormwind City.
