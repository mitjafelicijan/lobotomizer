Title: Essence of Zalmos
Description: You seek answers that are veiled in shadows, obscured by deception. The ones who sent you may have their own agenda, but it matters little now. You have found me, and the time for idle talk has passed.$B$BIn the distant lands where Seradane flourishes, the owlkins were entrusted with the solemn duty of safeguarding what remained of Zalmos' essence. Ages have passed since those days, and the memories of their ancient charge may have faded. However, there is a chance that they still possess the soulgem that holds a fragment of Zalmos' being.$B$BThat is all the information I will provide. Now, be gone from this place, for I desire solitude and the company of my kin. May the spirits guide your path, and may our paths never cross again.$B$B<Cenerron's piercing gaze lingers on you for a moment longer before he turns away, his attention drawn back to the primal world surrounding him. The message is clear: your time here is over, and he wishes no further interference in his secluded existence.>
Objective: Venture to the Hinterlands and discover where the local owlkin might be keeping the Soulgem of Zalmos.
