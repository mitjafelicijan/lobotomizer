Title: Palkeote
Description: Do you know the legend of Palkeote, the grey mother?$B$BShe is the spirit of an ancient kodo who walked this land in the distant past, in the days even before the sundering. This land was green then, and she roamed it for many years with her mate and her children.$B$BOne day, one of her sons fell ill with a sickness that would not leave him. He fell further behind the pack with each passing day, until he finally collapsed northwest of here, near a river that has now gone dry.$B$BPalkeote stayed with her son, but she could do nothing to stop his passing. She would not leave even then. Her herd moved on and the seasons passed around her, but still she remained, until she herself passed away beside him. Her watch did not end even then, and she remains as a mighty spirit.$B$BThe Earthmother pities the suffering of all life, and she pities the suffering of mothers most of all. Palkeote's vigil has made her strong, but it is time for her to rest. Muster your allies and end her long watch, $C.
Objective: Find and defeat the spirit of Palkeote.
