Title: The Wrath Of The Light Fall Upon Thee
Description: One would hope the scum of Azeroth would keep to themselves in their lightforsaken depths. Yet their disregard for morality and lust for power drives them to spread chaos. The Cult of the Damned is no different. Founded by the Lich King's majordomo, the Archlich Kel'Thuzad, it is the reason these lands are the way they are now. By spreading the Plague of Undeath at the dawn of the Third War, they made clear that their souls are pitchblack and devoid of light. Making a mockery out of the sanctity of life is a crime deserving of the swiftest and most severe punishment.$B$BAre you the one to meet out justice? If so, lend me your strength against them.$B$BHigh atop the mountains, past the Plaguewood to the west, lies the Forlorn Summit. Seek comrades and vanquish their leaders. Purge them from the face of Azeroth.
Objective: Defeat the leaders of the Forlorn Summit near Terrordale. Report to Lord Maxwell Tyrosus once justice has been dealt.
