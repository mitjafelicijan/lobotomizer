Title: The Orcish Anatomy
Description: Pssst… I've got a task for you, $C. Look behind me. I found this drunk orc spyin' around Ironforge and captured him, see? But I want to get a little “creative” with my payback. Bring me his head in good condition and I'll show you somethin' very worth your while.
Objective: Kill the Stupefied Orcish Peon and bring his head to Professor Papucho.
