Title: Mazen's Behest
Description: As caretaker of the works here in the library of the Academy of Arcane Arts and Sciences, it is my responsibility to ensure all the magical tomes and scrolls are accounted for at all times. Who knows what folly would unfold if some of these enchanted texts were to fall into the wrong hands?$b$bWhich reminds me... my assistant, Dellis, made a horrible mistake last week. He's quite able in the library but incompetent when he leaves the gates of Stormwind. Be a hero, and help old Dellis out, would you?
Objective: Speak with Acolyte Dellis in Stormwind.
