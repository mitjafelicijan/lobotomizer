Title: The Ravaged Caravan
Description: A few days ago, we found a Venture Co. caravan traveling under guard on the northern shore of Stonebull Lake. We'd lost two of our number in an earlier battle, so we were quick to attack and lay waste to the caravan.$b$bWe left their supply crates, thinking that our torches would destroy anything of value, but given that Venture Co. salvagers have been spotted near the burned wagons, maybe we were wrong.$b$bPerhaps you could go to the caravan and examine the contents of the crates.
Objective: Morin Cloudstalker wants you to examine the contents of a supply crate at the Ravaged Caravan.
