Title: Magical Interference
Description: I've been puzzled for a long time as to why the magic they now wield has been so familiarâ€”it lays just on the tip of my finger. As you were dealing with the rabble of enforcers and conjurers, I studied harder and came up with an answer.$B$BThe magic is that of the Kirin Tor, I am certain. I spent quite a bit of time in my living life around mages of Dalaran, and now that I think back, checking my books, I am certain.$B$BIf Dalaran is here, then that means they must be attempting to check us in our expansion within Tirisfal Uplands.$B$BReturn to the Rogue Heights and scour the hillside. Check for any source of the Kirin Tor's presence and put an end to it. We cannot have our enemies doing as they please freely within the countryside.
Objective: Travel to the Rogue Heights and put an end to the Kirin Tor's influence once and for all.
