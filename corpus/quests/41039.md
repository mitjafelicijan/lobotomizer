Title: Provisions for Thalanaar
Description: The people of Thalanaar have labored diligently to sustain our forces, but alas, their efforts alone prove insufficient to satiate the needs of our squad. We Sentinels must not burden them with the weight of our demands, for they have already sacrificed much for our cause.$B$BThough our skilled huntresses have ventured forth to secure provisions, the magnitude of the task requires the contribution of every willing hand. I have witnessed the presence of prowling wolves in the vicinity, their hunger mirroring our own. Embark upon this hunt, and procure ten succulent chunks of their meat, that our strength may be fortified.
Objective: Bring 10 Chunks of Wolf Meat to Sentinel Glensha at Thalanaar in Feralas.
