First, I need you to get your hands on some Skullsplitter Mojo for me. I will be usin' it in ma ritual to bestow power upon ye. That, and well, let's say I don't exactly like them Skullsplitters.$B$BThey can be found deep in the jungles of Stranglethorn, by ruins in the eastern parts of the region. Go there, and get me 20 of them, that should do, just nicely.
