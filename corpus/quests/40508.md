Title: Take No Chances
Description: Raz'gol Deadtusk, the name makes me regret what is to come.$B$BHe was one of the first I told of my plot to depart from the Old Horde, a dearest friend from the days on Outland. He was too stubborn to accept, his loyalties rigid, and hard.$B$BHe will not be coming with us, and we both know what must be done.$B$BIt hurts me to ask it, but Raz'gol Deadtusk must be slain, should he find out that I went through with my idea his loyalties to me will be pitted against the Blackrock Clan, and I cannot trust him to hold to his word.$B$BYou will find him atop of the large spire in the Pillar of Ash, he looks down upon the region with an iron glare, slay him, and bring his blade back to me as proof of your deed.$B$B$N , do not make him suffer.
Objective: Slay Raz'gol Deadtusk atop the Spire looming over The Pillar of Ash and bring The Deadtusk Blade to Karfang at Karfang Hold in Burning Steppes.
