Title: Soul and Alchemy
Description: The potion brewed by the Scarlets that you retrieved is known as the Draught of Dormant Death, or Mortudiant as we scholars prefer.$B$BIt was first conceived during the Second War, in Dalaran, to aid in countering the unhallowed might of Gul'dan's death knights.$B$BIt can only be concocted with a specific alchemical implement commonly used in transmutation known as the Philosopher's Stone. Which, unfortunately, I neither possess nor know how to emulate.$B$BFor now, you should return to your masters in the Undercity with what you've learned. I will keep the potion and see whether I can learn anything else.
Objective: Return to Varimathras in Undercity.
