I have been sent here by this very Rebellion to implore Stormwind's aid in supporting our cause.$B$BYet, amidst these pressing matters, there is a favor I must humbly seek your assistance with. During the time Greymane court played host to many guests, a man named Isiden Perenolde graced our halls. This man, esteemed by many as the rightful heir to the throne of Alterac, could be of immeasurable value to the Alliance, should he lend his support.$B$BWhispers have reached my ears that the Harlows might be holding him captive within the confines of the dreaded Dryrock Pit. I entreat you to commence your search there and, should you discover any information pertaining to this esteemed guest, do not hesitate to return it to me.
Objective: Find any information about Isiden Perenolde. He is rumored to be kept captive at the Dryrock Pit in Gilneas.
