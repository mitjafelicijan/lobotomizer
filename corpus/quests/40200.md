Title: Tanglemoss
Description: When we battled with the Razzari we were able to deal quite a lot of damage to Zul'Razar, and even occupied part of the city. Until a large lot of Creepers came in, led by a massive beast named Tanglemoss, who drove us out.$B$BTanglemoss is a lurking, horrific beast that patrols the ruins of Zul'Razar and has slain many ogres. We have always thought of him in stories, and rumors as a beast that lingered within the shadows and made those that traveled alone dissapear. I think I speak for many of us when I say that I prefer the story of Tanglemoss to be just that, a story.$B$BTravel to the Ruins of Zul'Razar to the west, and slay Tanglemoss, bring its foul heart to me.
Objective: Bring the Heart of Tanglemoss to Blatarg in Maul'ogg Refuge.
