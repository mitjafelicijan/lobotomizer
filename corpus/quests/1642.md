Title: The Tome of Divinity
Description: In all things, a paladin must reflect the Light which supplements our strength. To strive to be divine for one of our kind does not mean we strive for godhood--we strive to be good in all actions.$B$BAlthough called upon to smite evil in these harsh times, you must always remember that it's aiding others that will truly set you apart from the citizens of Azeroth. Compassion, patience, bravery--these things mean as much to a paladin as strength in battle.$B$BKnow this well, and never forget it.
Objective: Speak to Duthorian Rall in Stormwind.
