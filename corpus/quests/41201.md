I heard you've been turning Blackstone upside down with all the issues you solved for the hothead up on his tower. Not that I mind, keeps my back free to pursue more interestingâ€¦ ventures. $B$BSpeaking of interesting - I believe you are more than ready for your second summoning spell. A dangerous invocation, one that many young warlocks fell victim too. The required materials I'd need to teach it to you are sadly not here on Blackstone, but Gan'rul Bloodeye in Orgrimmar can provide the necessary components for your training.$B$BSend my regards to him, he still owes me a sack of reagents. He usually spends his time in the Cleft of Shadow in the center of the capital.
Objective: Talk to Gan'rul Bloodeye in Orgrimmar.
