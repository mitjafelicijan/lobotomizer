Title: Volcanic Activity
Description: Being an apprentice to Marvon Rivetseeker, I've learned so much. But he's been gone for such a long time now, so I think I'm going to work on some experiments of my own.$B$BI've been reading about Un'Goro Crater most recently, and about the strange volcanic activity going on in the middle of the crater. I think a lot could be learned if I could just get some of the ash from the elementals there.$B$BDo you think you'd mind collecting some for me, if you are going that way?
Objective: Collect 9 samples of Un'Goro Ash from the fire elementals around the volcano in Un'Goro Crater, and return them to Liv Rizzlefix in Ratchet.
