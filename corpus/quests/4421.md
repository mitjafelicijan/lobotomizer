Title: The Corruption of the Jadefire
Description: Not many seek adventure here... Felwood's corruption is widespread and indiscriminate.$B$BAs part of the Emerald Circle, I seek to heal this land, but there are some that wish it to fester.$B$BThe ones I speak of are the Jadefire satyrs that dwell to the northwest of here, at the Ruins of Constellas. Led by a particularly cruel satyr named Xavathras, they continue to spread the disease to any creatures they encounter.$B$BWe must defend this land that was once ours. Defeat Xavathras and destroy his minions.
Objective: Kill 11 Jadefire Felsworns, 9 Jadefire Shadowstalkers, 9 Jadefire Rogues, and Xavathras. Return to Eridan Bluewind in Felwood when the task has been completed.
