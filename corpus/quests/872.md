Title: The Disruption Ends
Description: One of my scouts witnessed an attack on a caravan from Durotar, $N. The culprits are indeed the Razormane tribe of quilboars. One of the quilboars in particular is leading the raids: Kreenig Snarlsnout. He was seen northeast of here, just south of the road from Durotar. If the threat is to be ended, then Kreenig must die.$B$BTo be sure the attacks cease, though, I say we add insult to their injury. Kill Kreenig along with more of their tribe, and return to me when you have his tusk.
Objective: Kill 8 Razormane Geomancers, 8 Razormane Defenders, and Kreenig Snarlsnout.$B$BThen bring Kreenig Snarlsnout's Tusk to Thork at the Crossroads.
