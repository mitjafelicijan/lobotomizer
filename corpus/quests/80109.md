But I've got a plan, see?$B$BAn old friend of mine is the cook at Razor Hill, the orc town just below that guard tower. Torka and I write now and then, and he ain't above bragging about his cooking.$B$BHe went so far as to say his boar ribs could bring the commander there to his knees. We're counting on that.$B$BHunt some of these boars and bring their meat to Torka. We'll have him cook 'em up and put in a good word for us, yeah? Any goblin will tell you one good word can take you all the way to the top!
