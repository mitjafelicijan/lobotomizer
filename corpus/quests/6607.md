Title: Nat Pagle, Angler Extreme
Description: Can't say I really enjoy fishin' much. Figure I been at it for a good 20 or 30 years now.$B$BI reckon people are driven to do what they do for different reasons.$B$BNow, I'm not saying you need to fish for 30 years or catch every fish in the sea to become a master fisherman. I reckon you just need to be determined - determined enough to sit on your duff for hours at a time, doin' nothin'.$B$BI'll tell you what, catch me a few rare fish and I'll teach you a thing or two. Here's a list:
Objective: Nat Pagle wants you to catch the following fish:$B$BMisty Reed Mahi Mahi from the Misty Reed Strand in the Swamp of Sorrows.$B$BA Sar'theris Striker from the Sar'theris Strand in Desolace.$B$BFeralas Ahi from the Verdantis River of Feralas.$B$BSavage Coast Blue Sailfin from the Savage Coast of Stranglethorn Vale.$B$BReturn to Nat Pagle when you have reeled them all in!
