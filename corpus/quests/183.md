Title: The Boar Hunter
Description: Nothing like a day of boar hunting, eh?$b$bThough, here in Coldridge Valley, there are so many boars it almost takes the fun out of it. No need to get them charging. They're all angry and ready without any help. In fact, recently, there've been so many boars in the area, it's become dangerous for me to do my daily hunting.$b$bLong story short, if you could help me kill some of the boars, I would appreciate it.
Objective: Talin Keeneye would like you to kill 12 Small Crag Boars.
