Title: Gates of Uldum
Description: So, we finally have the full set. There is only one thing left for us to do. It is time to unlock Uldum and find out what secrets it holds.$B$BAfter all you have done, $N, I think you should have the honor of being the first one to enter. From what we have seen at Uldaman, I doubt that this endeavor will prove to be simple, which is why I think you should find adventures who are willing to accompany you on this journey.$B$BI would be happy to join you myself. However, there is still the matter of telling the grim news to the families of the expedition.
Objective: Head to the Valley of the Watcher in Tanaris and activate the Pedestal in front of the gate by using the Plates of Uldum.
