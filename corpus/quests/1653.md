Title: The Test of Righteousness
Description: Actually, I have no doubt that Jordan himself would like to thank you, and seeing as I need a messenger to send word that his wife is safe, I think you'd be a perfect choice.$B$BJordan was to be a paladin of the Light before his dedication to his father's craft took him on another path--he's intimately familiar with our way of life and is considered among our most faithful.$B$BHe should still be in Ironforge--he likes to work outside the gates during the day, something about the cool mountain air.
Objective: Speak to Jordan Stilwell in Ironforge.
