Title: Taming the Beast
Description: Whoa, whoa, easy there, champ! I can see you're chomping at the bit to tame a wild beast, but there's a catch. Us goblins don't exactly get along with nature, know what I mean?$B$B<Viz grins wryly.>$B$BLet me show you how it's done, the goblin way. See this rod? It comes with a special collar that I call the "Friend Request". You put this around any wild animal's neck and that beastie becomes your bestie, get me?$B$BProbably oughta start you on something easy. A Dire Mottled Boar should be simple. You'll find them wandering around just outside of Razor Hill.$B$BEven a kid like you should be able to do that much. So don't waste my time by coming back here without one!
Objective: Use the Taming Rod to tame a Dire Mottled Boar. Practice your skills, then return the Taming Rod to Viz Fizbeast in Razor Hill.
