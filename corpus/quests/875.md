Title: Harpy Lieutenants
Description: Hahaha, $n. Back for more? Good, I like to hear that.$B$BThis time I want you to assassinate some of the harpy lieutenants in the Dry Hills. Only Witchwing Slayers can be lieutenants, and you can tell them apart by the rings they carry. They are a nasty bunch, but they lead some of the underlings in that area. Taking out 6 of them will be a decisive strike against their matriarchy.$B$BMake sure they die painfully, $n. We want those harpy wenches to know the idiocy of picking fights with the Horde.
Objective: Collect 6 Harpy Lieutenant Rings from Witchwing Slayers and return them to Darsok Swiftdagger at the Crossroads.
