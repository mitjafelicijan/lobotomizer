Title: On a Boar's Trail
Description: Krog's suspicions were founded, he was right to believe the quilboar may have had something to do with the burning of the inn.$B$BBefore you arrived, so did I. I followed a track, or should I say smell towards a pack of quilboar, they donned the colour of war and were headed towards the Razorfen Kraul, their main den.$B$BLuckily for us, they have stopped in their trails close to it, conveniently near the road.$B$BYour task will be to extract information from them, if any. Although I highly trust my tracking skills, I find my brute force lacking. Judge me if you must, but see the deed done.$B$BAnd the human... He is here to investigate, too. Better leave him alone, for now.
Objective: Hunt the quilboar party in the Barrens near Razorfen Kraul and retrieve the Quilboar Tablet for Kagoro in Dustwallow Marsh.
