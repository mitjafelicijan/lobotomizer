Title: The Old Church of Westfall III
Description: Oh, so you speak of that old church, out in Westfall? It has been a long time since I have been there, an incredibly long time. I must say that I do not believe I will be much of a help. Most of what I can remember is the sun beating down on me as I walked there and back.$B$B<Baros Alexston lets out a small laugh at the memory.>$B$BThe one who ran it was an old fellow though, always was quite nice, and cheerful. He raised many spirits of the downtrodden farmers back then and helped out where he could.$B$BSuch a shame that such a thing could happen to an honorable man. If you're looking for information, your best bet would probably be the Cathedral here in the city, find Bishop Farthing, he might have an idea.
Objective: Speak with Bishop Farthing at the Cathedral of Light in Stormwind.
