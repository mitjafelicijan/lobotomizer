Title: Exquisite Goblin Engineering
Description: Well, we great goblins here at Mudsprocket have managed to do a little digging. We gathered some of the ash from nearby the burned down inn, and are looking to study it to see if the fire was truly cause by dragons.$B$BTo do so, we need some materials, we will need to construct a Gizz-matic Scope, a personal creation of mine to look deep into the ashes properties.$B$BI would also like to gather a Pristine Flame Sac, from the nearby whelps in the region, it will give us good insight into what exactly we are dealing with!
Objective: Bring 5 Whirring Bronze Gizmo, 1 Standard Scope, and 1 Pristine Flamesac to Gizzix at Mudsprocket in Dustwallow Marsh.
