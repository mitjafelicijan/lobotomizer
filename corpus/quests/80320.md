Title: Burning Bridges
Description: Hey $c! I've got a business proposition for you. My boss sent me to track down defectors from the cartel that joined up with the Burning Blade and I've found out that Fizzle isn't the only goblin playing with demon fire around here.$B$BKnobby Tinfault's hiding in Dustwind Cave on top of the Drygulch Canyon. Find him and bring me anything he's carrying that has so much as a strange mark on it. We need to get any info back to Gazlowe so we can find out if there's more to their schemes.
Objective: Kill Knobby Tinfault and bring anything he drops back to Miley.
