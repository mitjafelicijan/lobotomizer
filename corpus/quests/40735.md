Title: The Micro Filter Tazzo-Scope
Description: Would you just look at that thing? A sheer Marvel of nature itself!$B$BI wouldn't want to risk planting this in the ground before I use all other options. I am a mage after all, and what better way than to make a formula to transform regular bananas into something like this!$B$BFor that to be an option, I need to study the Gargantuan Banana. I need a Micro Filter Tazzo-Scope, patent pending.$B$BTo create the scope I need you to get me the following materials, but trust me, they will be worth it! I need a Star Ruby, A Blue Sapphire, and an Accurate Scope. Once you get them, come back to me, and I'll make it.
Objective: Collect a Star Ruby, a Blue Sapphire, and an Accurate scope for Tazzo Gearfire to create the Micro Filter Tazzo-Scope.
