Title: Quark's Justice
Description: That damn rat. He stole from me, did he now? I'm handing him over, but before that, I want you to stare that mongrel in the eyes and tell him that he got caught. Beat him to a pulp, and then hand him over to Odo.$B$BAfter you're done, speak to The Rov. I want you to tell him to keep watch and tighten up the security around here. Can't just go around having thieves in my own shack, ya know? When you're all done, come back to me and there'll be a reward in it for ya.
Objective: Arrest the rat. Speak to The Rov about security details.
