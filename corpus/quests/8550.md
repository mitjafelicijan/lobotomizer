Title: The Horde Needs More Peacebloom!
Description: Hello again, Abyssmal. I am glad that you wish to speak to me once more concerning our neverending need for peacebloom. The war effort continues, and with it our production of potions and elixirs to aid in the battles to come. Will you help us again, $C? I am in need of the same amount of peacebloom as before, so if you can gather it up and return it to me here I would be most grateful. Of course, if you already have it on your person, I will be more than happy to accept it from you now
Objective: Bring 20 Peacebloom to Herbalist Proudfeather at the Valley of Spirits in Orgrimmar.
