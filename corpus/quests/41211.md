Title: Pest Control
Description: We have received notice from Orgrimmar. The Warchief wishes to use the abandoned mine just before Stonetalon Peak for additional resources that the Horde is in dire need of. Ever since its desolation after the Third War it was used by the Venture Company to mine from, but now the aggressive Deepmoss spiders have taken residence in the mine's old tunnels. The Horde cannot reliably gather resources with the mine suffering from infestation.$B$B$n, do your part for the Horde's prosperity and cleanse the Broken Cliff Mine of the eight-legged pests. You can find the mine by turning west on the ascension to Stonetalon Peak.
Objective: Cull the Deepmoss population within and around the Broken Cliff Mine and return to Maggran Earthbinder in Sun Rock Retreat.
