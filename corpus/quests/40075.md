Title: Swords to Sorrowguard
Description: It has been so long since I last heard from Sorrowguard. I honestly had assumed the orcs had taken or destroyed the keepâ€”that, or something equally as bad. I am not a cynic, just a realist. It's a dangerous place, that swamp!$B$BStill, I held onto the swords, just in case something bad happened to us. It's better to have them than have some coin, I figure. Take them to Janet. She should be relieved I didn't happen to sell them off.
Objective: Take the Delivery of Swords to Janet Hollowworth in Sorrowguard Keep.
