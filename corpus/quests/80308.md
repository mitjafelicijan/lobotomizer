Title: Tobacco Thieves
Description: So... we may have a slight pirate “infestation” problem. While cargo was being delivered from the Undermine, these damn pirates raided the boat and looted it. The crew escaped safely, but more importantly, the cargo was all gone!$B$BIt's a lot of wasted coin. Quark is expecting a big shipment, but a lot of it has either been smoked or lost to the sea. Just try to get whatever you can back and I might be able to fudge some numbers.$B$BYou'll find the pirates to the south, down the coastline.$B$BQuark's waiting for that cargo, so you'd better hurry. Something's better than nothing.
Objective: Retrieve 20 Tobacco Crates.
