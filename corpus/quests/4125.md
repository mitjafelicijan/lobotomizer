Title: The Missing Courier
Description: It's been about a week since Raschal, the courier, set out for Thalanaar.He knows Feralas well; he's been with us since General Feathermoon led the expeditionary forces here.I know his plan was to take a row boat down the coast and try and traverse across southern Feralas to avoid the Horde camp.$B$BI couldn't find his boat, but maybe you can.Maybe it is hidden, or maybe it was sunk.Regardless, it might hold a clue as to where he is.If you uncover something, please let me know.
Objective: Locate the courier's boat somewhere along the coast of Feralas.
