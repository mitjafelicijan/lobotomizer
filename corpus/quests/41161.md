Title: The Supercutter 1500
Description: When you came here all the way from the Black Ash Coalpits, then you've probably seen the big, hulking machine. Gazzik considers it his masterpiece - the Supercutter 1500! With it we harvested this island faster than any shredder could. Truly marvelous, I have to admit. Too bad some idiot decided it would be a great idea to drive the thing into the mud. Really, groundbreaking stuff, I wish I could've caught that guy and strangled him for messing with our efficiancy that much.$B$B<Fanzo sighs and rubs his temples.>$B$BIt's not been that long, but I don't remember who controlled it that day. Furthermore, we weren't able to assess the damage yet because of this overblown work schedule. I want you to go to the crash site and look at how badly damaged it is. While you're there, recover the Supercutter's remote, so we can check it for any malfunctions.
Objective: Retrieve the Supercutter 1500's remote from the Supercutter 1500 north of the Black Ash Coalpits for Fanzo Edgeline at Gazzik's Workshop.
