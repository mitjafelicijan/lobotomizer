Title: Grabb Mudhide
Description: As long as there is someone leading the heckling dogs over there, my problems won't stop anytime soon. From what I could gather, gnoll groups usually operate under the leadership of atleast one alpha that commands his subordinates rather violently. Heh, ironic, isn't it?$B$BI want you to get rid of their leading brute. Saw him a couple of times, taunting us. Blasted beast, Grabb Mudhide's his name. He usually frequents the cave just past this pond. Cut off his paw, I need a trophy to show my wife in Sparkwater that I'm not just slacking off on this bleak island.
Objective: Bring Bruiser Yevo at The Water Hole the paw of Grabb Mudhide.
