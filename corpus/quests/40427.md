Description: Many years ago the wizards of Stormwind discovered a large crystal that held an intense amount of magical energy. This crystal we named Arc'Tiras, and stashed it deep within the Stormwind Vault after many mishaps with the unstable magic it emitted.$B$BLittle did we know this crystal, Arc'Tiras had a mind of it's own.$B$BIt has driven the guards mad, and turned the Stormwind Vault into nothing more than corridors of madness. Our magic is enough to hold the crystal at bay, for now, but it needs to be destroyed, and for good.$B$BTravel into the Stormwind Vault, put an end to this madness.
Objective: Venture deep within The Stormwind Vault, find Arc'tiras, and slay him for the good of Stormwind. When done, return to Pepin Ainsworth.
