Title: Threat From the Sea
Description: Before you take rest, speak to Tok'Kar again. While you were gone I believe he finished a few weapons. For your help here, he would offer one of them to you. You would do well to test its strength against the fish men when you are ready... but only to please me further.
Objective: Speak with Tok'Kar in the Swamp of Sorrows.
