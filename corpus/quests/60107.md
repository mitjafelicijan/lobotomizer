Title: Cold Feet
Description: The damned cold won't leave me. I thank you for the pelts, $N but I wonder if I may trouble you again?$B$BI paid a helpful soul, Calvin, to go to Solliden Farmstead to retrieve my slippers before you happened along. He hasn't returned and I've heard that he may be less than honest. Undeath doesn't change an opportunist it seems. My slippers are in a footlocker at the farmstead.$B$BThe reports I overheard about Scarlets in the area are the least concerning. The murlocs like anything shiny I've heard and I did keep that footlocker polished up...
Objective: Retrieve Gretchen's slippers from the shiny footlocker north of Solliden Farmstead.
