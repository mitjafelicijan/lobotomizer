Description: Greetings, $N.I am Conservator Ilthalaine.My purpose in Shadowglen is to ensure that the balance of nature is maintained.$b$bThe spring rains were particularly heavy this year, causing some of the forest's beasts to flourish while others suffered.$b$bUnfortunately, the nightsaber and thistle boar populations grew too large.Shadowglen can only produce so much food for the beasts.Journey forth, young $c, and thin the boar and saber populations so that nature's harmony will be preserved.
Objective: Kill 7 Young Nightsabers and 4 Young Thistle Boars and return to Conservator Ilthalaine.
