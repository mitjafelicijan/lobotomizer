Title: Threat of the Winterfall
Description: I came to Winterspring to investigate the Frostfire Hot Springs. I've noticed that the water seems to have ...strange qualities. I haven't yet been able to discover the source, and to tell you the truth, I've had some difficulty lately, due to the Winterfall furbolg.$B$BThey seem to be drawn to the springs, just as I am. They have become extremely protective of the water, and won't let me come near the two larger springs to the north of here.$B$BI'd like to continue my studies, so won't you help me?
Objective: Donova Snowden in Winterspring wants you to kill 8 Winterfall Pathfinders, 8 Winterfall Den Watchers, and 8 Winterfall Totemics.
