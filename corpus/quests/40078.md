Title: The Murloc Menace
Description: When we first set up, we relied on supplies from the eastern shoreline that traveled by wagon to get to us. It seemed like a safer journey than going through all of the chaos of Deadwind Pass. Now, with the insanity of Fallow Sanctuary and the sinking of the Crownguard off the coast, we are hard-pressed to get supplies.$B$BThe murlocs who sank the ship have been a menace to us since we landed, and we need to deal with them. You will find them on the eastern shoreline. Exterminate them, and perhaps we will be able to reopen trade.
Objective: Kill 6 Marsh Inkspewers, 6 Marsh Murlocs, and 6 Marsh Flesheaters for Watch Sergeant Arthur.
