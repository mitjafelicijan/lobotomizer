Title: The Magic of Dragons
Description: I have long pondered the presence of the green dragonflight gathered about the temple sunken at the center of the lake. They have prowled and patrolled with adamant defence, and left us curious as to what may lay inside.$B$BAs much as such mysteries make my mind go wild with curiosity, I am not an adventurous soul as to find out why they are guarding it. I have been working with magical goods for most of my life, and have been dying to get my hands on a Glittering Green Scale. One that has been enfused by the power of Ysera and charged by her will. I must admit, it may be hard to come across one.$B$BTravel to the Pool of Tears, and hunt Green Dragonkin, look upon their corpses for a single Glittering Green Scale, entwined with powerful magic, and bring it to me.
Objective: Bring a Glittering Green Scale to Thultazor in Stonard.
