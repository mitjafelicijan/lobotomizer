Title: Crystalvein Mine Cleanup
Description: Ah, Todd, good ol' blacksmith, that one. He sure had a knack for working with those metals. I'll give him that. But here's the thing, I can't exactly fulfill his request for that ore he's after. It's a bit of a sticky situation, ya see.$B$BThe mine he's talkin' about, the Crystalvein Mine, got itself overrun by those pesky basilisks. Nasty creatures, they are. Just one gaze from 'em, and poof, you're a crystal! So, understandably, we goblins have been keepin' our distance.$B$BBut hey, if you're feelin' either foolish or brave, and you're up for clearin' out the basilisks from that cave, well, we might just have ourselves a deal. You do the dirty work, and any ore you find there is yours to keep. Fair and square. Mind ya, it's gotta fit in your backpack, though. Can't have ya luggin' around mountains of the stuff.$B$BSo, what do ya say, adventurer? You up for the challenge? If so, head northeast from here, and you'll find the Crystalvein Mine.
Objective: Gather 10 Crystalvein Ore and slay 6 Trashtail Basilisks and 6 Ironjaw Basilisks for Crank Fizzlebub in Booty Bay.
