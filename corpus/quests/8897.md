Title: Dearest Colara,
Description: I've got to keep watch here at the gate, but I'm always worrying about my sweetheart, Colara. I only get to see her for a few hours, if I'm lucky, and well, just look at me. I've got a minor officer's pay and I could be called to the front any day now.$b$bWould she just forget about me? There are a lot of men in the city. A lot of rich ones.$b$bAnyways, I've scribbled some things down... nothing much, but if you could take it to her for me, that'd be great.
Objective: Deliver Lieutenant Heldric's Carefully Penned Note to Colara Dean outside the bank in Stormwind.
