Title: The Karnitol Shipwreck
Description: Intriguing.$B$BWell, we might not be without hope quite yet.$B$BAlong that same coast, but to the north near Ranazjar Isle, there're night elf ruins at the bottom of the ocean. A tribe of naga, the Slitherblade, make that their home. I think that'd be our best bet.$B$BIf a scouting party went that far south, then they must've been pretty powerful. If you're gonna find Karnitol's belongings, I'd start with the more powerful naga: the tidehunters or sea witches.
Objective: Find Karnitol's Satchel and return it to Kreldig Ungor in Desolace.
