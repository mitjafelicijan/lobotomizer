Title: Chapter III
Description: Chapter III was my favorite.It tells of Sir Erlgadin and Lady Rouack's first kill with a dwarven rifle.And the end of Chapter III, why, such a cliffhanger!$b$bLooks to me as though we still need pages 18, 20, 21 and 24 to finish the chapter.Those pages are out there somewhere. . .
Objective: Bring pages 18, 20, 21and 24 of Nesingwary's The Green Hills of Stranglethorn to Barnil Stonepot in order to complete Chapter III.
