Title: By Any Means Necessary III
Description: If we truly wish to restore Felwood to its former state, then we must do more than what we have been doing. I have been fighting against corruption endlessly, but with seemingly no progress.$B$BI desire an artifact that was stolen from me many months ago. I came into contact with an orc named Ulathek, who kept his intentions hidden from me. Despite his use of shadow powers, he seemed well-versed and willing to assist me.$B$BHe stole from me a gemstone of great power, which I want back to use for the greater good of this region. This orc now lingers among the cultists and demons of Jaedenar within Shadowhold, the Barrowden they have corrupted.$B$BKill him and retrieve the Gemstone of Salthax from that accursed place.
Objective: Venture deep within the Shadowhold in Jaedenar, slay Ulathek, and return the Gemstone of Salthax to Niremius Darkwind in Felwood.
