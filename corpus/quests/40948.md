Title: Wolf Amongst Sheep
Description: Tell me: what is the essence of a nation, the heart of a country, the will of a people? Is it the lands themselves? The rule of law? The economy? No, undoubtedly, it's none of these things. The essence of a nation is found in its tradition, history, legacy, determination, willpower.$B$BWe must steel ourselves for the worst, as the entirety of our people wishes to free our king and place him on the throne once more, But what happens if he is not capable of doing so? After the death of the queen, Genn thought it best to send his children away. We only heard about it months later, but it seems that both Liam and Tess are now prisoners of the Harlows.$B$BWe believe Liam is captive in the Dryrock Mine deep under Gilneas City to the west. He is the heir of this country, and so he must bleed with his people in order to liberate it.
Objective: Find Liam Greymane.
