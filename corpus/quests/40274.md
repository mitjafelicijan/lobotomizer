Title: A Bad Day to Fish!
Description: The Southfury River wasn't always so bad, not when we first settled here. The floods and rough waters made for a test of will against the natural forces of our new home, but something has changed recently that caused a massive increase in crocolisks!$B$BAll I want to do is fish all day, but now I have to fight off beasts and spend more time with a weapon in hand than enjoying my fishing spot.$B$BBefore you ask, I've done enough fighting for one lifetime from the siege of Durnholde to the battle of Mt. Hyjal. I just want to relax and contribute this way. Go out and secure my fishing spot and I'll give you one of my handcrafted fishing rods.
Objective: Slay 8 Dreadmaw Crocolisks for Grubgar at Southfury River in Durotar.
