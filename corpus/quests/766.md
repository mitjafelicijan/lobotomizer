Title: Mazzranache
Description: My grandfather told me stories about his battles with a strider named Mazzranache. He told me of its demonic red eyes, razor-sharp talons and venomous bite.$b$bAs fortune would have it, while traveling across the plains, I encountered it, and it took a nasty bite from my shoulder. He was as terrible as my grandfather described. I will need some hard-to-find animal parts to clean the infection from his bite: a wolf heart, cougar femur, plainstrider scale and swoop gizzard.$b$bHurry, time is of the essence.
Objective: Bring a Prairie Wolf Heart, Flatland Cougar Femur, Plainstrider Scale and Swoop Gizzard to Maur Raincaller at Bloodhoof Village.
