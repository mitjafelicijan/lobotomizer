Title: Culling the Riverpaw
Description: At last, they sent aid!$B$BThere's a large camp full of gnolls led by a mighty gnoll known all over Elwynn as Fedfennel. Rumor has it he's been eaten by his own rivals... I digress. The camp is further up to the north, past Stone Cairn Lake.$B$BIt's tucked away in a distant corner that the guards don't patrol, so the gnolls run rampant out there. Do us all a favor and wipe out a full brigade of them and we'll have at least a week of sound sleep.
Objective: Kill 10 Riverpaw Runts and 10 Riverpaw Outrunners and return to Supervisor Raelen in Eastvale Logging Camp.
