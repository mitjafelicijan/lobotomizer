Title: The Head of the Hunters
Description: Before you run off like a fool, I have one more task to add. This Scalebane Ridge, it has not cropped up out of nowhere. I would bet my large fortunes that there is a lieutenant of some sort leading the operations.$B$BI want him dead. Certainly taking him out of the picture will impede all the work that goes on there, hopefully indefinitely. I trust you have a few friends that may help you with such a task? Good, go. I will compensate you appropriately.
Objective: Slay Kegdesh Foulmantle in Scalebane Ridge for Senator Barin Redstone in Ironforge.
