Title: The Key to Karazhan V
Description: <Krog lets out a deep, rumbling laugh.> What do you think, that we are spying on Theramore? Ha! As if we'd waste our time on those weaklings. No, no, my friend. It's just a coincidence that we happened to come into possession of their ledgers. They lost them somewhere in the swamp, it seems. Lucky for us, eh?$B$B<Krog flips open the ledger and runs a thick, green finger down the page.>$B$BLet's see here... Ah, yes. V-A-N-D-O-L. He arrived via boat about four years ago, and then departed on a small ship heading south along the coastline. That's all we've got to go on, I'm afraid.$B$BNow, if you're really keen on finding him, I suppose you could try hiring a boat from the smugglers and sailing along the coast. Just be careful, though. There are rumors of a vengeful sailor who's been terrorizing the shores lately.
Objective: Find Vandol. He is living somewhere on the eastern coast of Kalimdor, south of Theramore.
