Title: Cenarius' Legacy
Description: You cannot imagine the hatred I possess for this wretched land. The ilk of Cenarius and the kaldorei druids at the peak employ their pathetic powers to stifle the flow of magic, even so far south of their pathetic holdings... their beloved forests.$b$bWould that I could return to Jaedenar and exult in the flow of magic, but my master will not allow me to return until my work is done.$b$bI have no doubt you love the night elves and their allies as little as I. Aid me, and both our ends might be satisfied.
Objective: Kill 4 Sons of Cenarius, 4 Daughters of Cenarius and 4 Cenarion Botanists for Braelyn Firehand near Sun Rock Retreat.
