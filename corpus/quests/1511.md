Title: Ken'zigla's Draught
Description: I figured there might be another coming to get the draught, so I prepared it anyways.$b$bHere you go, $n. Mind you, you should only give half of it to him! That will give him enough strength to move without bleeding himself dry. Wait a night, then give him the other half.$b$bAnyways, you'll want to bring this to Logmar at Camp Taurajo. From what the first one told me, he should have an idea where this Dogran is.
Objective: Bring Ken'zigla's Draught to Grunt Logmar at Camp Taurajo.
