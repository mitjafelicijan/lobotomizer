Title: A Quest for the Moonwell
Description: I do sympathize with the Quel'dorei's plight. Perhaps there is another way to provide them with what they need.$B$BIf the High Elves are willing to honor the sanctity of our moonwells, then there might be a chance to plead for a small well to be built in Alah'talas under the guidance and vigilance of a priestess.$B$BAfter all, we agreed once before to do the same for Stormwind.$B$BTravel to Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas and look for Vestia Moonspear. She is sympathetic to your cause and will be likely to listen.$B$BGive her this missive and pay close attention to what she has to say.
Objective: Travel to Feralas and deliver the missive to Vestia Moonspear.
