Title: Life Comes To The Legend!
Description: Alright! Now that you've heard the stories, it's time to get in there on a hunt. I bet that there's some truth to the legends. I'm all set up here to wait for your report. We should dig into the nearby lands and see what you can find! I'll give you a freebie! Find me the Goblin hired Great-Father Winter... Hehe! And look for the source of our Greatfather Winter, as well as the Great Winter Spirit or whatever they called it.
Objective: Find the Great-Father of the Goblins, Greatfather Winter of the Dwarves, and the Great Spirit of Winter of the Ice Trolls for Mulin Snowbeard in Winter Veil Vale.
