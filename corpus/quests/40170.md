Description: <It would only take a single glance at the key with inquisitive eyes for the troll to crack a small smirk>.$B$BI can do this, though I must wonder why I would help you, especially for free.$B$BIf you want me to work the magic of this key, and attune it for you, I will need a favor from you.

Let us say that me and him are not on the best of standing and I want you to bring me one of his gnarled horns from his battered corpse.$B$BTravel to Felwood, to the Ruins of Constellas, you will find Pethax Blackhorn there, it is his horn I desire.
