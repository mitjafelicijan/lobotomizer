Title: Taming the Beast
Description: The final task that I have for you requires that you tame a creature that inhabits the sky. The swoop is a difficult opponent, but as your ally, you will acquire its sharp attacks and threatening presence.$B$BBy the will of the Earthmother, when you return I will bestow you with the skills you will need to tame an animal of your choosing to be your companion; this creature will face the challenges you face, and gain experience alongside you. I will also show you how to call it and dismiss it as you wish.
Objective: Use the Taming Rod to tame a Swoop. Practice your skills, then return the Taming Rod to Yaw Sharpmane in Bloodhoof Village.
