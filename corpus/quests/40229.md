Title: Angor Fortress
Description: Angor Fortress looms like a dark cloud in the Badlands, from there the Dark Iron can muster immense amounts of power. They are one of the key players in the region for that very reason.$B$BI have been sent from Ironforge to attempt to dissolve some of their grip here, and to do so, we will need to strike hard. I desire you to travel to Angor Fortress just to the north west, and slay those that guard it. Take from them their Shadowforge Shackles they wear, 10 of them in total, and bring them to me.
Objective: Slay Dark Iron Dwarves around Angor Fortress, and collect 10 Shadowforge Shackles for Senator Broadbelt in Badlands.
