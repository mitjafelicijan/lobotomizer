Title: An Old Friend
Description: My channeling will take some time to uncover the source of what lurks beneath the surface. In the mean time, I would ask of you a favor that means more then these very islands. An old friend of mine, who goes by the name Itharius is currently located within the Swamp of Sorrows. He was originally sent with Eranikus in tasks regarding the sunken temple, and watching over its masters destruction.$B$BUpon my exile, I gave Itharius my necklace, one that holds much of my power, and essence. It is from this very necklace that I will need the energy needed to defeat the evil upon these islands.$B$BI told him a time would come where I would reclaim my birthright, and he may be aprehensive, but he will do as I asked him long ago. Find Itharius, and reclaim my necklace from those swamps.
Objective: Speak with Itharius to recover Insom'ni's necklace.
