Title: The Work Must Continue
Description: If we ever want to get back to work, we need to make sure things are safe again. The apes are not my workers biggest concern, it is those snakes, do you believe that?$B$BAll of my workers are more terrified from those Brushtails, rather then the massive gorillas.$B$BGoblins right?$B$BThey slither in the brush and attack at dark, they need to be dealt with.$B$BOnce this monkey threat is dealt with, there will still be snakes, and I hate snakes, why don't you deal with them for me? The Brushtail Adders and Cobras are aggresive, attacking anything in sight. Remove them, and maybe my workers will have more courage to pick bananas.
Objective: Slay 8 Brushtail Adders, and 8 Brushtail Cobras for Baron Telraz at Tel Co. Basecamp on Tel'abim.
