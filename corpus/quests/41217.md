Title: A Score To Settle
Description: I must burden you with one more request, $N. A few weeks past, as I scoured the hills in search of ideal spots for grape cultivation, I fell victim to a lynx of unparalleled ferocity. In the ensuing struggle, the creature overpowered me, leaving me grievously wounded, my eye forever lost.$B$BA personal vendetta now brews within me against this formidable adversary. Vanquish the beast and retrieve its fang as evidence. I will easily recognize it; the fangs were larger than any I have ever seen.
Objective: Bring 1 Fang of Shar'Lan to Maelor Steelguard as a proof of your deed.
