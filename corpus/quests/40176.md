Title: Crumbling Allies
Description: When we first came to this island, we were greeted by hostility from all who were around us. We were seen as pirates still, and had yet to make a mark for ourselves. It was the Seer Jang'zo from the Razzari tribe who helped bring peace between us and them. For quite a while we kept a rather peaceful bond with one another. We traded and assisted with tasks of both a spiritual nature and physical.$B$BThough all seems to have fallen apart within the last weeks. The Razzari have began to show hostilities toward us, and have even gone so far as to attack. There are rumors of them speaking with the Hazzuri trolls and being influenced by their dark magics. There must be some kind of curse at play.$B$BI fear for Jang'zo and wish to assist him, as he did us. I require materials from around the island to create a spell that could lift such a curse. Firstly I need 6 Junglepaw Fangs from the local panthers, 3 Creeper Roots from the ruins creepers in the Ruins of Zul'Razu, and a single Jungle Venom Gland from the jungle serpents.
Objective: Collect 6 Junglepaw Fangs, 3 Creeper Roots, and a Jungle Venom Gland for Euokia on Gillijim's Island.
