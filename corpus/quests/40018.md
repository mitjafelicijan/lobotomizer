Title: War on the Witherbark
Description: The Witherbark are a brutal enemy, one that attacked in the dead of night and had no mercy for my people. Those of us here were lucky to escape, and now it seems as if they are just biding their time for the next attack.$B$BWe must not let it be so. As outnumbered and unprepared as we are, we need to reduce their ranks. Head into the Ruins of Zul'Rasaz and kill as many of the Witherbark as you can manage. Show those traitors that the spirits remain on our side and that we remain the true masters of these heights.
Objective: Kill 14 Witherbark Raiders, 8 Witherbark Soothsayers, and 5 Witherbark Rogues.
