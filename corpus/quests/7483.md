Title: Libram of Rapidity
Description: Master Winthalus lost the Libram of Rapidity in the east wing. The Libram will allow for a minor haste cantrip to be placed upon your equipment. Parlor tricks, really...$B$BRegardless, if you are interested, you will need to present the Libram along with some basic reagents.$B$BHrm... I believe it also requires blood of heroes, a pristine black diamond, and large brilliant shards. I could be wrong!$B$B<Lydros shrugs.>
Objective: Bring a Libram of Rapidity, 1 Pristine Black Diamond, 2 Large Brilliant Shards, and 2 Blood of Heroes to Lorekeeper Lydros in Dire Maul to receive an Arcanum of Rapidity.
