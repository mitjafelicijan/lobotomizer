Title: Did You Lose This?
Description: You have done much for the Order, $N. The sheer dedication it takes to get this far would have turned away any ordinary person. There is no doubt in my mind, or in the mind of Galvan, that you are one of us.$B$BWhich is why I think you deserve a little reward. It is nothing really, just a trinket. You may be familiar with its properties, as I do believe it is what brought you to us in the first place.
Objective: Wait for Trenton to finish his work.
