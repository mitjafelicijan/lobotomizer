Title: Restocking the Stockings
Description: Oh no, you've come looking for the Maison Serendipity Winter Veil clothing too? Well, it's embarrassing, but...I'm completely sold out at the moment! You see, Rouge magazine just did an article about us and, well... we didn't expect such a rush! $B$BI need to get word back to the shop that I need a new shipment, but I really shouldn't leave my post. You know, judging by your clothing, you seem a well-traveled sort. Could you just run back to Stormwind and ask them to send me more product? The atelier is in the Park, near the entrance. Just ask for Madame Gres and let her know the situation. She'll get it handled!
Objective: Travel to the Atelier Serendipity shop in Stormwind Park and ask Alix Gres to send Vera Lauren a new shipment of clothes.
