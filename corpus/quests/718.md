Title: Mirages
Description: In our hurry to leave the Uldaman excavation site, we were forced to abandon many wagons and crates of supplies along the way. The local ogres from Camp Kosh have been on our abandoned equipment like vultures on a rotting corpse. Don't smell much better, either. Than the corpses, I mean.$b$bAnyways, they took the cart that was carrying all our weapons and such... so--well, this is a bit embarrassing--we haven't been able to get any food.$b$bWe're in a bit of a pickle here, suppose you could help us out?
Objective: Retrieve the Supply Crate for Sigrun Ironhew.
