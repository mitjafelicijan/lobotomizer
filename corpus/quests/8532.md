Title: The Horde Needs Copper Bars!
Description: So glad that you've decided to help out here. Not everyone would, so I need to make sure you understand what it is that I need. Copper bars, not copper ore. We don't have the time or people to do all of the smelting ourselves, so if you would be so kind as to take care of that, your efforts will be duly noted. Is that something that you can handle, $c?
Objective: Bring 20 Copper Bars to Miner Cromwell at the Valley of Spirits in Orgrimmar.
