Title: Outnumbered
Description: Ah, you look like someone who can get things done, $C. Listen closely, as I do not like to repeat myself. The humans outnumber us five to one. However, they are not aware of this yet, and I would like to keep it that way. My servants informed me that the Lordaeron scouts are heading towards Glenshire from the north. And you, my friend, are going to make sure that they never return to their masters.
Objective: Slay 8 Remnants Scouts in the Whispering Forest and return to Duke Nargelas.
