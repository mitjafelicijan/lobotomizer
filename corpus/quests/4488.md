Title: Summon Felsteed
Description: Ah, $N, you've seen fit to grace us with your presence. How wonderful!$B$BI hope you do not expect us to wait on you hand and foot also. You may be growing quickly in power, but you still are a pup when it comes to true knowledge and understanding. If you're not careful, corruption will overwhelm you and your weak will.$B$BBut I should get to the point: Strahad wishes to speak to you. He is still residing in his tower overlooking Ratchet in the Barrens. I suggest not taking too long.
Objective: Speak to Strahad Farsan in Ratchet.
