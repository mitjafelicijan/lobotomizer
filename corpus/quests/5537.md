Title: Skeletal Fragments
Description: The key to Scholomance is called a Skeleton Key.It must be forged from the remains of a skeleton - several actually - and hardened by only the strongest of metals within a suitable mold.A signet of power from a being who naturally can open the portal to Scholomance will make the key ultimately function.$B$BFirst thing's first though, $N.We'll need skeletal fragments for the key's forging.Skeletons inside Andorhal should yield what we need, but the ones outside the walls might work too.
Objective: Bring 15 Skeletal Fragments to Alchemist Arbington at Chillwind Point, Western Plaguelands.
