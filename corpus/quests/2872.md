Title: Stoley's Debt
Description: My old buddy Stoley owes me a very special bottle of rum.He tends the bar at Steamwheedle Port in Tanaris, Kalimdor,and he promised me that the rum there is stronger than anything we can find in Booty Bay.He's so confident that he says if I try that rum and don't agree with him, then he'll double the money he owes me!$B$BWell, I think he's not as confident as he was when last we spoke, and now he's afraid to give me that rum.But I don't back down from wagers, so why don't you talk to him for me...
Objective: Speak with Stoley in Steamwheedle Port.
