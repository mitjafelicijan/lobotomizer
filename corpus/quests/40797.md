Title: A Foul Effigy
Description: The carving of a Furbolg has been riddled with sharp thorns and splinters of metal. They are gouged into its face, neck, and body. And yet, the carving can clearly be made out to have an almost childlike appearance. Was this someone's toy once? What were the Satyr doing with it?
Objective: Return the Effigy to its owner.
