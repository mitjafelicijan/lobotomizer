Title: Reassignment
Description: It shouldn't be a problem getting my report seen. The new captain of the guard, Major Samuelson, was my mentor while I was stationed in Stormwind. It should give him more than enough excuse to have me transferred back to the city. I'll need you to carry my report to him, though... wouldn't want ol' Redpath to catch on.
Objective: Deliver Farren's report to Major Samuelson in Stormwind Keep.
