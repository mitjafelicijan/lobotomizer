Title: The Horde Needs More Tin Bars!
Description: Very good, I see that you are serious about the war. I'm a little edgy waiting for it to start though, which means I'm going to get angry if you don't start bringing in the goods faster. Maybe I can just practice on you instead.$B$BHar! Maybe not, 'cuz then who would bring me back the tin bars?
Objective: Bring 20 tin bars to Grunt Maug in Durotar.
