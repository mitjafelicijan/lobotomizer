Title: The Flight Logbook
Description: Dinkle Togpipeâ€”he was out at the landing pad to the far east on a small island.$B$BWe used that landing pad as a refueling area and resting spot for pilots. We used to have them dispersed across the ocean near the end of a Flight-Machine's fuel usage. It was previously possible to get from Gnomeregan to Kalimdor with ease, but I feel that the landing pads are in a state of disrepair. We haven't heard much in a long time from back home.$B$BIf you want the Flight Logbook, go and get it from Dinkle Togpipe stationed out there.
Objective: Travel to the Landing Pad in the east and obtain the Flight Logbook from Dinkle Togpipe, then return the Flight Logbook to Gigno Flaxwhisker.
