Title: Components of Importance
Description: $C, listen closely. Now that we have the brazier, and the means to light it, we still need another component to suffuse it with; something that will provide a focus strong enough to summon the remains of my deceased, former comrades.$B$BThe siblings, Jarien and Sothos, were believers in the way of the Scarlet Crusade. They aspired to knighthood within that vile organization. Go to Tyr's Hand in Eastern Plaguelands and retrieve a Brilliant Sword of Zealotry from the praetorians there.
Objective: Retrieve a Brilliant Sword of Zealotry and return it to Bodley inside Blackrock Mountain.
