Title: The Runestone Curse
Description: I have tried my hand at lifting the curse with the required items, but it would appear there is still something wrong.$B$BAfter a careful studying of the Runestone I have come to the conclusion that a chunk of it has been removed. I have my guesses, but I believe a satyr named Xalthix is in control of this chunk. With it, he can keep this curse active indefinitely.$B$BFind Xalthix, and from him, recover the Runestone Chunk.
Objective: Find and slay the satyr Xalthix within Hyjal, and recover the Runestone Chunk for Buthok Cloudhorn near the base of Hyjal.
