Title: Preventing Poison
Description: We've done it, $N! With the help of the druids, we have found a cure to the Dreadmist Poison affecting the Barrens. It will take time for the earth to heal from the poison's damaging effects, however. $b$bDruids are curing the remaining sickened beasts, but we can also act to protect the herds from the lingering poison until the land has recovered completely.$B$BTake this salve. Feed it to gazelles to strengthen them against the poisoned grasses.
Objective: Vaccinate 10 Gazelle of the Barrens to protect them from harm.
