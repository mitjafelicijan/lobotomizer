Title: Lost and Stranded
Description: The Tidemaster was sent off course after a scrap with some pirates. The next thing I knew, pure chaos erupted as sailors were tossed into the ocean and ripped across jagged rocks! Murlocs attacked, and the night erupted into screams and battle. I ran and found shelter upon this small island all the while my crewmates suffered a fate more horrible than you could imagine!$B$BI've been trapped here ever since. The murlocs have been trying to fight me, but they haven't had any luck yet, so they mostly stick to the shore. On the last attack, they ended up stealing a crate that had many of my belongings, but most importantly, my compass. If I am ever to get back to Kul Tiras, I will need it to find my way ashore. Find their small camp down the hill on this island. Find my compass among their hovels, and while you're there, kill some in revenge for the Tidemaster!
Objective: Slay 6 Wallowfin Murlocs and find Wally Burnside's Compass on Crown Island.
