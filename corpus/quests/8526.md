Title: The Alliance Needs Roast Raptor!
Description: Oh, how's it going, $c? I see that you're interested in maybe gathering up food for the coming war at Ahn'Qiraj? Somehow my dad thought that it would be a good learning experience for me if I were to volunteer to help out here. Big mistake. I don't even like to eat meat.$B$BAnyway, if you feel like it, you could bring me back a lot of roast raptor. Apparently that's what all of the soldiers are going to want.
Objective: Bring 20 Roast Raptor to Sarah Sadwhistle at the Military Ward in Ironforge.
