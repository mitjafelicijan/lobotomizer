Title: Gahz'ridian
Description: $N, I'm a scientist, but also a treasure hunter at heart!$B$BLong ago, when trolls used to occupy this land, they created large amounts of ornaments modeled after Gahz'rilla, a hydra they worshipped as a deity. These ornaments are carved out of an element that I call "Gahz'ridian," after the hydra god.$B$BI did find some myself, but I'd like to have some more to study -- maybe you can find some?$B$BI even invented a detector that makes finding the Gahz'ridian a snap! Just put it on, and the search begins! 
Objective: Marvon Rivetseeker in Tanaris wants you to collect 30 Gahz'ridian Ornaments.
