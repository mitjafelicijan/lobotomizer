Title: Green Versus Green
Description: You've gotta be kidding me. Here we are, a mile above every mountain pass, and there's elves up here?$B$BListen, kid, elves are the most irrational creatures in the world. A good goblin, he looks at a forest and he sees profit! But what does an elf see? Bears? Owls? Little baby squirrels with the big eyes? It makes me sick.$B$BCongratulations, you get to be the muscle today. Go out and cut down a few tree-huggers, would ya? And some of their weird living plants while you're at it. I don't trust anything that walks around on vines.
Objective: Kill 7 Stonetalon Environmentalists and 5 Highpeak Lashers, then return to Nert Blastentom.
