Title: The Key to Karazhan I
Description: The Living? Here? I thought I would never see the day.$B$BMy cursed spirit is forever bound here, unable to find the sweet release of true death. The memories of my past still haunt me, a never-ending reminder of the consequences of my actions.$B$BYet, here you stand, wandering through these halls, oblivious to the horrors that await you. Stay for a while and listen to my story if you care enough, and maybe the mysteries of Karazhan will unravel to you. But be warned, for there are more secrets buried within these walls than even I could comprehend.$B$BPerhaps, if you are brave enough to delve into the enigmas left by Medivh, the true purpose of this cursed place will reveal itself. Or perhaps, like so many before you, you will become lost in the maddening puzzles that have ensnared so many others. Either way, I will remain here, a cursed ghost of the past, forever trapped within these walls.
Objective: Listen to the story of Lord Ebonlocke.
