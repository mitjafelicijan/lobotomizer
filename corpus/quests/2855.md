Title: Wild Leather Shoulders
Description: Wild Leather shoulders support a wearer's frame extremely well, offering superior protection of the upper arms as well as the shoulders.As with all Wild Leather armor, a random yet very potent enhancement is imbued within the item as the wildvine is stitched in.$B$BFor this pattern, I will require six thick armor kits and a wildvine.That shouldn't be too tall of an order for you to fill.
Objective: Bring 6 Thick Armor Kits and a Wildvine to Jangdor Swiftstrider in Camp Mojache.
