Title: A Slaughter for Brains
Description: My search for my nemesis continues, but as that search continues, so too does the work that needs to be done. I have needs of brains! I am currently researching an amazingly innovative technology, but it needs to be perfected for all races.$B$BI need more samples and I know exactly where to get them! Far south and slightly east of Gadgetzan you will find a set of Troll ruins known as the Eastmoon Ruins! There are Ogres there. Tear them apart violently! They're going to attack the water reserves of Tanaris and cause a lot of people to die from thirst.$B$BWater is already expensive, but if the reserves are destroyed by those brutes, the price will skyrocket and most people won't be able to afford water. Let's avoid that. Kill them all. Once you have them, take the brains to Reas and then come back to the crystal.
Objective: Violently retrieve 12 Smooth Ogre Brains from the Dunemaul Ogres at the Eastmoon Ruins and then deliver them to Reas.
