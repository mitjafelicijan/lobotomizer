Title: A Troubling Presence
Description: $N, may I borrow a moment of your time? Your past assistance has not gone unnoticed, and there's a delicate matter that requires your attention.$B$BIt appears we are not alone in this new refuge. Our scouts have reported the presence of a significant force atop a nearby hillâ€”our former brethren, the so-called blood elves. They are loyal to the traitorous prince, Kael'thas, and their dependence on dark magic clouds their judgment. They pose a threat to our cause, and their proximity to Brinthilien raises concerns.$B$BI must task you with a challenging mission: seek out and eliminate this group of blood elves. They are led by a man named Veloren Brightstar, a figure whose removal will sow chaos among their ranks. The safety of our community hinges on the success of this mission.
Objective: Find the blood elf camp and eliminate the threat to Brinthilien. Return to Commander Anarileth once the task is done.
