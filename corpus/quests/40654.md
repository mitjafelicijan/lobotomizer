Title: Glittering like Gold
Description: The coin is much larger than any coin you have seen before, and quite a bit heavier. It appears to have someone's head engraved in the surface, but is too covered in muck and dust to be made out clearly.$B$BRubbing some dust off the surface, the material seems to get shinier and shinier. Is this gold?
Objective: Show the coin to someone in Ironforge who knows about these types of relics.
