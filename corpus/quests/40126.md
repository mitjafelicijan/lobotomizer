Title: Discovering the Source
Description: <The Archmage takes his time to study the magic.>$B$BHmm, I can hardly believe this, why would they... <Ansirem mumbles quietly to himself.>$B$B$N, what we are dealing with is much more serious than I had originally thought. The magic remnants upon the ley-shards are of draconic origin. What the Dragonflights would want, or need, from dampening magic in Azshara is a great mystery, but at the least we now have a source.$B$BI have prepared this letter for Bromley. Take it to him, and let him know that the Blue Dragonflight is responsible.
Objective: Take Archmage Ansirem's Letter to Magus Bromley in Azshara.
