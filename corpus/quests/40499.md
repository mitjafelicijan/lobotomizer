Title: Preventative Antidote
Description: Greetings, recruit of the new horde. I suppose you're here to aid? Then I got the task for you. To the west of the hold you can find the deadly venomtip and deathlash scorpids, their body might be fragile but their venom killed many aspiring orcs. I know how to brew an antidote to cure such ailments, but problem is that the antidote is made from the venom glands of the scorpids themselves.$B$BGo out there and collect their glands, if you survive your efforts will save many lives. If you perish trying then you'll be forgotten like the rest.
Objective: Collect 8 Venomtip Venom Glands and 6 Deathlash Venom Glands and return to Soresh in Karfang Hold.
