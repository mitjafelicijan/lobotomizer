Title: Ebonmere Worgen Infestation
Description: The worgen in Gilneas entered shortly after the Greymane wall was destroyed in Oldrock Pass. You see, a powerful lich invaded the land and destroyed Greyshire some time ago. Now the forests themselves are packed full of the beasts, threatening to overtake my farm at any minute.$B$BI need you to collect their pelts and prevent any future attacks. Six pelts from the Bloodclaw and Nighthowl worgen should suffice. You can find these packs to the west and southwest.
Objective: Collect 6 Bloodclaw Pelts, and 6 Nighthowl Pelts for Joshua Ebonmere at Ebonmere Farm in Gilneas.
