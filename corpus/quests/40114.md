Title: Uldum Awaits
Description: The time has come. It is as the Earthmother told me. We have no idea what we might find in Uldum, and if dangerous factions seek to enter. Then all the more reason for us to take extreme precautions.$B$BI urge you to avoid the mistake I have made with the war party. Before you go, find trustworthy allies who would accompany you to the gates. There is no telling what awaits you and I there. I will be working on putting our friends to rest. It is the least I can do to atone for my mistake. Go now, and may the winds be ever at your back.
Objective: Head to the Valley of the Watcher in Tanaris and activate the Pedestal in front of the gate by using the Plates of Uldum.
