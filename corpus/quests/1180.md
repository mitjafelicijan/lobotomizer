Title: Goblin Sponsorship
Description: Back to what you came here about. I know I promised Pozzik that I'd deliver a new fuel regulator for him, but I still haven't received it yet. Revilgaz over in Booty Bay said he'd have it shipped over, but it might be it slipped through the cracks somehow.$b$bIf that's true, there's not much we can do about it. We can at least find out if it was dispatched from Booty Bay.$b$bCheck in with Wharfmaster Lozgil over there, he should be able to check the cargo records.
Objective: Speak with Wharfmaster Lozgil in Booty Bay.
