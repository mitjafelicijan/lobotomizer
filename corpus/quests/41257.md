Title: Legacy of Blood
Description: Any of our people who decide to take up a mage's robes should be well-prepared for the pitfalls of that path. If you intend to continue down this road, I should prefer that you be well-educated for your journey.$B$BThe magical addiction and loss of the Sunwell that plagues our people goes doubly for us! Your calling will be a constant kindling for the fires of your hunger- you must learn to master it before it masters you.$B$B In Silvermoon, there was a man that was...a friend of mine. Tragically, not only did he defect to the prince's blood elves in an attempt to slake his thirst, but he also led many of our young mages with him to their ruin. I would not see another student fall prey to his ways. I have word that he has been sighted at Felstrider Retreat- find Gilaras Sunfury, see what becomes of someone who forsakes reason and morals for their cravings, and put him out of our misery.$B$B And do remember to tell him that Merisa hasn't forgotten what he did.
Objective: Kill Gilaras Sunfury at at Felstrider Retreat.
