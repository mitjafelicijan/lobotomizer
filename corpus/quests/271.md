Title: Vyrin's Revenge
Description: I don't suppose you'd be interested in a little payback for His Boldness? Daryl does have some skill, it pains me to say.$b$bA year ago, a large bear had been the target of the Farstrider Lodge, but none of the hunters had any luck with him. So, Daryl thought he'd try his hand against him. All he had to show for his effort was that ugly scar over his eye.$b$bKill the bear, and I'm sure even Daryl would be speechless for once.$b$bThe bear, Ol' Sooty, can be found around his lair in the hills over Thelsamar.
Objective: Kill Ol' Sooty then show your handiwork to Daryl the Youngling at the Farstrider Lodge.
