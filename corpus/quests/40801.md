Title: Patience is the Key
Description: You may see ruins around here, $c, but what I see is far different. I see a reminder of a lost civilization, a Kaldorei race that was strong, ordered, unified, unparalleled in might. And now, just across the hills, I see the horde invading our sacred lands.$B$BBut that is not what has happened. Instead we bicker with the sentinels while the horde spreads like a disease, ravaging parts of our ancient homelands. Sentinels throwing young lives away like they were meaningless. If Fandral was here, he would have those upstarts whipped into line in a moment.$B$BAnyway, what brings you to Forest Song? Are you here to help?
Objective: Listen to what Brother Ironglade and Commander Starwind have to say. Make a choice on the best course of action. Siding with one will likely make the other unreceptive to you.
