Title: Never Ask Me About My Business
Description: If there is one thing that you should know about me, it is this: NEVER ask me about my business! I work with things you simply cannot understand. Like for example: Do you know what a psychotronic muzzledorf is? Of course you don't! And that's why we leave the planning to me and the fetching to you.$B$BAs I said earlier, if this is going to work, we're going to need a 500 pound chicken.$B$BHead to Gadgetzan and speak with Dirge Quikcleave - he'll get you started on finding a suitable specimen.
Objective: Narain Soothfancy in Tanaris wants you to speak with Dirge Quikcleave in Gadgetzan.
