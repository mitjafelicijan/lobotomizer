Title: Retrieval for Mauren
Description: Travelers keep asking me about the Stonetalon Mountains. It seems to be a popular place for adventure--it doesn't matter if you're seeking wyvern, elementals, or you have business with the Venture Co.$B$BWithin the Charred Vale, deep in Stonetalon, there used to be a species of basilisks whose scales, when ground to dust, made a wonderful reagent for some spells I've created.$B$BIf those basilisks still live, I would love to have a few of their scales.$B$BTake your time, it is no rush, but I can pay well.
Objective: Bring 8 Crystalized Scales to Collin Mauren in Stormwind.
