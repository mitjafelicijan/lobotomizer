Title: Break a Few Eggs
Description: Bah! I almost forgot I need to get breakfast ready.$B$B$N, get yourself movin' and get me some taillasher eggs. I'll need at least three of them if I'm going to have enough for tomorrow's meal.$B$BThe Bloodtalon taillashers can be fierce, and protect their eggs to the death more often than not. They sometimes bury their eggs too deep in the earth to uncover safely, but if you head to the Echo Isles to the southeast of Sen'jin Village, you can usually find them all over those islands.
Objective: Bring 3 Taillasher Eggs to Cook Torka in Razor Hill.
