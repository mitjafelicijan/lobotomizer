The prized tunic of the Zandalar madcap is no exception, exuding the raw power of chaos and madness that they are able to channel.$B$BThe Paragons of Power I need lie in Zul'Gurub; bring me what I seek, and I will reward you with your own legendary tunic... one befitting a weaver of madness.
Objective: Bring Falthir the Sightless a Primal Hakkari Aegis.  You must also have a reputation equal to or greater than Revered with the Zandalar Tribe.$B$BFalthir the Sightless is located on Yojamba Isle, Stranglethorn Vale.
