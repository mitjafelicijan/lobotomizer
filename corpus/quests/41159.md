Title: Dirty Deeds Drowned Deep Below
Description: Do you even have the slightest idea what kind of disaster this is? First, my ship got wrecked on this backwater island. Secondly, my entire crew besides Ranala either drowned or got devoured by these lobster things down there. And thirdly - most importantly! - I lost my log book when we jumped ship!$B$BYou may think a soggy, old log book might not be worth it, but there are things inside this book that CANNOT make it to any of the higher ups here on this island. And I mean it! I swear it on the life of my rich grandmother back in Undermine!$B$B$n, while you're down there, look for any signs of the Hangmans Plunder's log book. Should you find it, I will pay you with good and honest coin!
Objective: Recover the Hangmans Plunder's Logbook from its wreckage south of the Black Ash Coalpits and bring it to Dazlon Brassdigger.
