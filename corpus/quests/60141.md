Title: Duty to the Light
Description: To the Nobles of Stormwind, a Paladin is an elite soldier recognized for acts of great valor on the battlefield and for smiting enemies of the kingdom with righteous fury.$B$BThese are not the qualities which define us as servants of the Light, however. It is for our kindness and compassion for the weak and the poor we owe the people's faith.$B$BEven the most simple act of kindness is the cornerstone of a Paladin's duty and legacy, what separates us from a fool with a cudgel.$B$BThere is a struggling family in the Eastvale Logging Camp in need of assistance stocking their food stores for the year. I take it upon myself to aid them when possible, but with the mounting threats across the land of late, I am bound by duty to Goldshire.$B$BPlease, aid them in my stead. Hunt the Rockhide Boars found to the south near the forest's edge along the riverbank, and bring their meat to the Eastvale Logging Camp.
Objective: Bring 8 pieces of Rockhide Boar Meat to Eldrin in the Eastvale Logging Camp.
