Title: Return to Tymor
Description: Tymor didn't give me anything to pay you with, so I suggest you take it up with him when you get back to Ironforge. I'm sure he'll still be in his place in the Mystic Ward. Just go knockin' and make sure he pays you good. This place ain't no picnic... that's for sure.$B$BThanks again for helping him out though, and good luck.$B$BOh, and I don't need the drawing kit. Why don't you just bring it back to Tymor when you go to see him?
Objective: Return Tymor's Drawing Kit to him in Ironforge.
