Title: A Solvent Spirit
Description: Although my eyes fail me, I still can see clearly enough. More often I must rely on my alchemical skills to aid me in magics that once came easily. But I refuse to take on an apprentice--no troll or orc worthy enough has ever come forward.$B$BAre you worthy? Yes, of course you are... of course you think you are.$B$BI need a few things. Will you get them for me?$B$BI need intact makrura eyes, and vials of crawler mucus. You can find them on any makrura or crawler in Durotar. We shall speak again soon.
Objective: Bring 4 Intact Makrura Eyes and 8 vials of Crawler Mucus to Master Vornal in Sen'jin Village.
