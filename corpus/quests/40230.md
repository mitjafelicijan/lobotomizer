Title: Saltspittle Raiders
Description: Lake Falathim was a place I spent much of my youth, a place of relaxation and fond memories. Now, it is overrun by the Saltspittle murlocs, who attacked with ferocity and without remorse. Some died during the attack, but I was lucky enough to escape.$B$BIn my haste to flee, I left behind an item of extreme value to me: a book left to me by my Uncle who died during the Battle of Hyjal. In it he wrote about his technique in battle and his experiences regarding the war. I've found much knowledge and wisdom from that book, and I desire to know everything that he had jotted down before his passing.$B$BTravel to Lake Falathim to the southwest, and find my belongings. While you are there, I ask that you avenge my kin: Slay the Saltspittle and bring me their fins.
Objective: Gather 5 Saltspittle Fins and recover the Greenblade Book.
