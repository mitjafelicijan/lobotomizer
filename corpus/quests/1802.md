Title: Tome of the Cabal
Description: It was lost, but there's some idea as to where it might be found.$b$bThere was only one copy ever made and it was vandalized at some point, a large portion of it ripped from the binding. Rumor has it that it somehow passed into the hands of the centaur of Thousand Needles.$b$bThe rest was lost off the coast west of Southshore, where it was to be transported to Menethil Harbor by boat. It never arrived.$b$bIn exchange for this knowledge, all I ask is that if you find it, bring it to me to see.
Objective: Retrieve the Moldy Tome and Tattered Manuscript for Krom Stoutarm in Ironforge.
