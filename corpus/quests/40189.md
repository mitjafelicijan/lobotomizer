Title: To Make A Fortune
Description: That crash was a massive setback! Heh, set me back a whole bunch, I had trade deals all over Azeroth, one of the richest goblins, all in that zeppelin. Theres gotta be atleast a million gold showered around where that zeppelin is, and I can't even go and pick it up, damn basilisks!$B$BBut, I'm smart, the smartest goblin of all goblins in the world, and I got a strategy to make my wealth back, see?! Turtles live such long lives that I'm gonna harness the power of a turtle, with the wealth of gold to make either alot of gold, or make some serum that extends life!$B$BGenius, you see, genius! Now, go to the Silver Strand, its just to the west of here, and find me an Uncracked Turtle Shell, it NEEDS to be uncracked, if I see a single crack, you aint getting anything!
Objective: Gather a single Uncracked Turtle Shell for Blazno Blastpipe in Gillijim's Isle.
