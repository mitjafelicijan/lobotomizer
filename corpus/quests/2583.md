Title: A Boar's Vitality
Description: Within these blasted lands exists two species of boar: the ash-mane boar and the helboar.$B$BIt would appear that the stamina of these beasts renders them nearly immune to harm, as the other animals find them too difficult to kill and consequently, not worth the effort.$B$BWe need to perform further analysis, $N. Should you bring me three blasted boar lungs, two scorpok pincers, and one basilisk brain, I shall create a divine elixir from the residue of the assay. You will be my first test subject!
Objective: Bring three Blasted Boar Lungs, two Scorpok Pincers, and one Basilisk Brain to Bloodmage Drazial.
