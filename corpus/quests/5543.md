Title: Blood Tinged Skies
Description: Woe to those that foolishly wander into the Plaguelands. All manner of foulness inhabit these woods - from the fanatical Scarlet Crusade, who will kill any that do not bear the mark of the Crusade, to the murderous Scourge, who only look to bolster their numbers by adding more undead to their ranks.$B$BEven the wildlife have been transformed into rapacious, man eating beasts. I ask that you destroy those that would strike from the skies: The Plaguebats.
Objective: Slay 30 Plaguebats and return to Tirion Fordring.
