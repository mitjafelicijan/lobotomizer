Title: Knowledge on Withering
Description: Shadow welcomes you, $N. My name is Artemus and I've traveled long and far from Hillsbrad Foothills to do business with the Goblins of Powder Town. They are very unique to call them so. Madmen that would do anything for their goals and even for someone of my condition, this is very exciting!$B$BI used to study herbology in Dalaran when I was younger, regretfully I was nowhere near my home when the plague struck and there we have it. I won't bore you with a soapy story of how I came to be undead and how much I hate myself or whatever others say. I'm quite happy with my condition, I finally have the time to experience and learn everything I want to.$B$BI have traveled all this way to continue my studies, more specifically in decay. The local ancients in the Charred Vale have become withered, and tortured.$B$BBring me one of their Decaying Roots, it shall prove useful.
Objective: Gather the Decaying Roots for Artemus Halloway at Powder Town in Stonetalon Mountains.
