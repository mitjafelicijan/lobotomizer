Title: Aid Kagoro
Description: Kagoro had just left to investigate the hoofprints. He should be scouting the road to the Southern Barrens. A scout like no other, that orc, for many days has he tried to be worthy of a surname.$B$BHis actions will one day speak, and when that day comes he will earn his honor. I hold high respect for Kagoro, $R, but I believe he will be in need of your help if you were willing to offer it.
Objective: Find Kagoro on the road to the Barrens in Dustwallow Marsh.
