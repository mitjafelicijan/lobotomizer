Title: Spectral Wine
Description: Believe it or not, I do have a recipe for Spectral Wine. Wine that can be consumed by spirits was something that I did practice working on. It is somewhat complicated of a process and requires materials that are foreign here in Karazhan.$B$BIf you can acquire me three Essence of Death, five Flask of Port, and a single Ghost Mushroom, and I create Spectral Wine for Councilman Kyleson. Though I do question your sanity in doing this.
Objective: Gather 3 Essence of Death, 5 Flask of Port, and a Ghost Mushroom for The Cook in Karazhan.
