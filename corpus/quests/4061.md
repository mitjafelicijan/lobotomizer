Title: The Rise of the Machines
Description: The machines made themselves known to us during our initial forays into the Searing Gorge. Upon further investigation we discovered that they were being imported from Burning Steppes, possibly Blackrock Depths. That is what we need you for, $N.$B$BYour first task is to venture to the Burning Steppes and recover elemental shards from the rock automatons and lesser rock creations of the region. Once you have collected a sufficient amount, return to me and I shall determine their source of origin.
Objective: Venture to the Burning Steppes and recover 10 Fractured Elemental Shards for Hierophant Theodora Mulvadania.$B$BYou recall Theodora mentioning the golems and elementals of that region as being a source for these shards.
