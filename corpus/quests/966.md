Title: The Tower of Althalaxx
Description: A group of warlocks has taken up residence around and inside the tower. I would have returned to Auberdine to report to Elissa earlier, but I was afraid that I might miss something while I was away.$b$bDelgren suspected such a company might be gathering at the tower, but did not know why.$b$bA few scraps of parchment that the warlocks carry have found their way to my hands, but I need more to complete the puzzle. I warn you not to venture into the tower, however, the warlocks there are much more powerful!
Objective: Collect 4 Worn Parchments for Balthule Shadowstrike near the Tower of Althalaxx.
