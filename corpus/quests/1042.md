Title: The Carevin Family
Description: No, I don't have any records of a Velinde Starsong staying in Darkshire... though, if you don't mind me saying, I can hardly imagine a night elf priestess taking a room in the inn, if you get my meaning?$b$bThese wolf-men you mentioned though, that's something I've heard about. Just the other day, Calor came into town with a string of their heads. He works with the Carevin family. Hunters of demons, undead, and other monstrosities. Speak with Jonathan, he's the head of the household.
Objective: Speak with Jonathan Carevin in Darkshire.
