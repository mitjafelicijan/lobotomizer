Title: Grove of the Ancients
Description: If you had enough time to run messages for the Oracle Tree, then I'm sure that I can press you into service to deliver a message to the Grove of the Ancients in Darkshore, due south of Auberdine.$b$bYou will most likely have to secure transport on a hippogryph, but I have faith enough in you that you can manage that. Take this to Onu, the Ancient of Lore. He has been awaiting word from me, even as I waited for news from the Oracle Glade.
Objective: Deliver Fandral's message to Onu in the Grove of the Ancients in Darkshore, south of Auberdine.
