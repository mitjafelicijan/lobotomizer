Title: The Alliance Needs More Iron Bars!
Description: Back so soon? Stop making me re-evaluate my low opinion of you $c, you're making me feel all gooey inside. So, as you can tell we still don't have enough iron bars for all of the weapons, armor, steam tanks and whatnot that need building for the bug hunt. Think you have it in you to bring back another stack of twenty iron bars in between all of those trips to Zul'Gurub, or wherever it is that you kids hang out these days?
Objective: Bring 20 iron bars to Corporal Carnes at the airfield in Dun Morogh.
