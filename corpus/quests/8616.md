Title: The Horde Needs More Baked Salmon!
Description: The last batch of baked salmon that you donated to the war effort looked very delicious, $C. I must admit that I was tempted to take a few for myself. As you can tell, we have not yet reached our quota here. I am hoping you have returned because you have another stack of baked salmon with you
Objective: Bring 20 Baked Salmon to Chief Sharpclaw at the Valley of Spirits in Orgrimmar.
