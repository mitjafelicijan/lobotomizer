Title: Inquiring About Legend
Description: Greetings $r, enjoying the celebration? You may have heard the short abridged version of why this celebration was held when it was limited to Ironforge and Orgrimmar. But as you can see, there's much more than dwarves here. Many races seem to have a version of Greatfather Winter in their culture.$B$BI suspect there is more to this tale. Seek out the storytellers. Let's start with the Night elf, Tauren, and Furbolg version of the tale so that you do not get it all mixed up. Pay attention cause their stories likely contain important clues that we will utilize.
Objective: Inquire about Greatfather winter from the Night Elf Storyteller, the Tauren Storyteller, and the Furbolg Storyteller for Mulin Snowbeard in Winter Veil Vale.
