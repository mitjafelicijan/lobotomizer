Title: Arcane Golem Revolt
Description: Do you see these... withered husks?$B$B<Phylas sighs with frustration, his gaze fixed on the malnourished, once-elves>$B$BWe may very well end up like this if the Silver Sun Mine remains unreclaimed. The arcane golems, once loyal laborers, have been struck by some sort of arcane discharge â€“ no doubt the handiwork of those so-called Blood Elves. It's driven them mad! The mine is now inaccessible, and we've been severed from the source of those sweet, sweet arcane crystals.$B$B<Phylas shrugs, a mix of resignation and frustration on his face.>$B$BBut alas, the Regency Council seems more interested in courtly backstabbing than offering any meaningful assistance. So, if you've got the mettle for it, maybe you could clear out the mine of these deranged arcane golems? Payment, of course, will be in clear silver. A fair compensation for a dangerous task.
Objective: Clear out the Silver Sun Mine by disposing of 8 Malfunctioning Arcane Golems, 6 Defective Arcane Golems and 4 Arcane Pounders.
