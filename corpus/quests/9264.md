Description: The Scourge is camped upon our very doorstep; we cannot remain idle! Surely you will step up to defend Thunder Bluff from these accursed invaders? $b $bThere are strange runic circles outside, glowing with the same energy that surrounds the undead and the Necropolis above. They have significance, I'm certain, and I want you to find out what. Thin the numbers of those aberrations while you're at it; bring me proof of their death along with your results, and I will reward you.Go!
