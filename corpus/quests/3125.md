Title: Faerie Dragon Muisek
Description: $N, next I must have you capture a creature that in appearance, may look quite fragile, yet its powerful spirit is what we are truly after. The faerie dragons that I speak of have served the night elves as their allies. We must capture one so that the horde may benefit from this strength of spirit as well.$B$BHere is the muisek, $N. Kill 8 sprite darters or sprite dragons, and capture their muisek. They may be found to the west of here.
Objective: Kill 8 Sprite Darters or Sprite Dragons. Use the Muisek Vessel to shrink and capture the fallen Faerie Dragons.
