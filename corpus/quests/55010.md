Title: Grabbing the Gear
Description: ...Gah! We can't waste our time cursing the dumb lout... we have to get this fixed before the higher-ups in Sparkwater find out that I've put the important equipment in his hands.$B$BI'm willing to bet the Survey Equipment is still around where he died. The Satyrs probably pried it from his hands and are still trying to figure out what the complex goblin machinery is, and I doubt they ever will.$B$BGo back there and dispatch them until you find my Goblin Surveying Gear!
Objective: Travel to Haldarr Encampment and retrieve the Goblin Surveying Gear.
