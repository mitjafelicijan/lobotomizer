Title: The Hunt for Sorrowclaw
Description: Many long months I have spent in this hellscape hunting for a large jaguar. I have given it the nickname Sorrowclaw, for its ferocity and where it comes from. I have attempted to catch it, fight it, and even stalk Sorrowclaw, but every time I have been outsmarted.$B$BIt is as if the beast is three steps ahead of me at all times and I long to see its terror within the swamp come to an end. Perhaps you are a better hunter then me, and perhaps you can track down Sorrowclaw, and slay the beast once and for all.$B$BI assure you, it will not be an easy task, and I recommend you bring help should you truly wish to take after where I have failed.
Objective: Bring the Paw of Sorrowclaw to Zun'dartha in Stonard.
