Title: Medium Magical Fortifications
Description: Greetings. The Council of Dalaran is currently accepting donations of the magical kind from outside sources. Small Radiant Shards are a quite potent font of power used for many tasks within Dalaran and are always needed. For a Small Radiant Shard I'll put in a good word of your efforts within Dalaran, more than donations of weaker magical essences.
Objective: Bring 1 Small Radiant Shard to Magus Palon at Dalaran.
