Title: The Analyzation Chip
Description: If the Analyzor 53G is still out there, then this is great news! We spent so long on its Analyzation Chip that it would be almost impossible to recreate. We had the magic of Bromley the first time, and without it, I could not replicate it entirely.$B$BThe Rethress Sanctum is located just east of here along the coast. Naga inhabit it who are not the friendliest to us. I don't want to risk any of my crew to get the Analyzation Chip! You will find it located just beneath the exhaust port of the inhibitor chamber on the main chassis at the posterior side, easy.
Objective: Retrieve the Analyzation Chip from Analyzor 53G near the Rethress Sanctum.
