Title: Maritime Gumbo
Description: Howdy, partner! Rustgate has us living lavishly up here. Unlike those poor dirtbags down in the pits. But that's how things roll around here. That's what they call winning the lottery in life!$B$B<Shazzlan lets out a weird, nasally cackle.>$B$BHey, if you're already here, I could use some help, actually. You know, Rustgate has quite the... eccentric taste when it comes to his cuisine. He wants me to remake this maritime gumbo his grandmother used to make him back on Kezan. Usually not a problem, but the ingredients are not something we really have in stock up here. Oh, don't give me that look. I mean it, really!$B$BIf you bring me some crawler meat and makrura legs, I will teach you how to make it yourself. Could be useful if you ever need to appease the boss.
Objective: Gather the needed ingredients and bring them to Shazzlan at Rustgate Ridge.
