Title: Chasing Sand
Description: We sent out a crew weeks ago to begin doing some studies over the ruins down west and they haven't showed up yet, not even a peep.$B$BThe desert is a dangerous place so now rumor is going around they may have met some terrible fate. It is possible I suppose!$B$BWhat is really important is what we sent out with them, you see, when we trust someone, we usually give them some valueable gear, something worth a lot of coin, you dig?$B$BI need you to go out there and find that crew, or more importantly, get the Turbo-Scan Filtronomitor from whatever is left!$B$BThey should have been down near Eastmoon Ruins, check around there.
Objective: Find the Steamwheedle Crew and return the Turbo-Scan Filtronomitor back to Baggle Hackrust at Steamwheedle Port in Tanaris.
