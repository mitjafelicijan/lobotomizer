Title: Genetic Alteration Anomaly!
Description: The energy radiating off of the Dark Portal is sheerly astounding, and it's given me so many research opportunities that I do not know where to start! I was employed here as an analyst to watch the ever shifting arcane magic within the region, and its incredibly unstable, so unstable infact that it has warped the boars close to the portal itself, turning them into 'Helboar'!$B$BI know it sounds like something straight out of fantasy!$B$BI need you to get me a Pristine Helboar Brain, to see just how much the creature has been altered by the intense energy of the Dark Portal.
Objective: Collect a Pristine Helboar Brain for Engineer Wigglestip at Nethergarde Keep.
