Title: The Flaxwhisker Front
Description: Howdy! Welcome to Flaxwhisker post. Iâ€™m Fendo, in charge of all manner of things around here. I 'm supposed to direct any new arrivals in Flaxwhisker to the boss. That is to say, we haven't heard a word from Gnomeregan in months or received any new people! Still, good to have you around, $R. You'll find Gigno Flaxwhisker inside, at the top floor.
Objective: Speak with Gigno Flaxwhisker.
