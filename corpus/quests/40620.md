Title: Picking a Side
Description: You are not Gelkis. You are not even centaur at all. Leave now!$B$BWe have no reason to speak. Little will prove your friendship or worth to me. Except perhaps the conquering of the Magram, hah!$B$BI am wise enough to know you would never wage war on our behalf, and you are not even strong enough to do so anyway.
Objective: Slay Magram Tribe centaur to prove yourself to Uthek the Wise at Gelkis Village in Desolace.
