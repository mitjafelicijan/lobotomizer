Title: Pestering the Pesterhide
Description: From atop of The Jagged Hills, Chief Rnarl rules over the conjoined tribes of the Pesterhide. He has been rather tenacious, even when we tried to deal with him in the past. If we truly wish to scatter the Pesterhide Gnolls and send them into chaos, then we will need to strike at the heart of their leadership.$B$BChief Rnarl has been the one to unite the gnolls, and without him, they will crumble. While you are there, be sure to kill Belgar as well. He is a shaman that has strengthened the critters and spurred their actions even more.$B$BWhen these two fall, the packs will scatter. Bring me both of their paws, and you will receive a reward in silver.
Objective: Bring the paw of Belgar and Chief Rnarl to Deathguard Mike in Steepcliff Port.
