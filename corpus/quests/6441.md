Title: Satyr Horns
Description: Heya! I've been traveling through Ashenvale, heading towards Ratchet, and decided to make a stop here at Splintertree. I'm always looking for an opportunity, and it seems that satyr horns are in high demand in Ratchet these days.$B$BAfter asking around here, it seems that the satyrs in Night Run, Satyrnaar, and Xavian all have the type of horns I am looking for. I'm no match for those satyrs... but you look like you might be!$B$BTell you what, you collect the horns for me and I'll make it worth your time.
Objective: Collect 16 Satyr Horns for Pixel in Splintertree Post.
