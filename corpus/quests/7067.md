Title: The Pariah's Instructions
Description: Though exiled as a heretic, my beliefs still ring true--that alone drives me onward. But for my destiny to be complete, I need the aid of an outsider... one not of any centaur tribe.$B$BThe task requires someone to enter the holy halls of Maraudon--a tomb my people protect, and only the most devout are ever allowed to enter.$B$BIf you agree to aid me, then you need only nod. I will pass you a parchment with my instructions on it. Read it over and consider my words.
Objective: Read the Pariah's Instructions. Afterwards, obtain the Amulet of Union from Maraudon and return it to the Centaur Pariah in southern Desolace.
