Title: Alpha Aggression
Description: The alpha of the Ghostpaw Wolves in the area is named Ghoststalker. He is a ferocious beast that leads packs of wolves in the region with dangerous intent. If a balance of nature is to be brought, then the beast must be slain.$B$BYou should find him in the hills northwest of Lake Falathim and southeast of the Zoram Strand. I wish you luck in your hunt. Ghoststalker is a clever beast that has eluded me to this day.
Objective: Kill Ghoststalker and bring his paw to Ardaen Evermoon.
