Title: Verdant Sigil
Description: This sigil was given to me by a messenger from our druid trainer, Mardant. It seems Mardant would have words with you when you have a moment. Read it and bring it to him afterwards.
Objective: Read the Verdant Sigil and speak to Mardant Strongoak, in the tree Aldrassil in Shadowglen.
