Title:  A Historian Finds You
Description: On a cold and rainy night you decide to once more look at the notes as they remind you of your own first haul. As you reminisce about the past you also remember the wish you've had to find a historian or someone knowledgeable enough to aid in the future.$B$BAs thoughts drift through your mind you reach the end of Sovatir's journal and you find a rune accompanied by some words that felt very natural for you to say at this exact moment. As you mumble the incantation your head feels rather dizzy as you can now depict a ghostly figure that looks like the former owner of this journal.
Objective: Speak with Arcanist Sovatir.
