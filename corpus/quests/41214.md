Title: Peculiar Treants
Description: These lands echo the beauty of Quel'Thalas, yet within the similarities lies an intriguing divergence. Presently, I find myself engrossed in the study of the treants that grace this realm. Though they possess a semblance of familiarity, there's a peculiar quality about them that eludes my understanding.$B$BIf, by any chance, you could procure a primal heart from one of these beings, it would significantly propel my research. I'm not particularly skilled in combat, and the guards have thwarted my attempts to get too close. However, I believe they won't pose the same hindrance to you. What say you?
Objective: Acquire a Thalasian Primal Heart from Thalassian Treants for Calhir Dawnchaser in Anasterian Park.
