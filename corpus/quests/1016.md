Title: Elemental Bracers
Description: Take this divining scroll--it can determine the creator of these elementals. But you will need something from them to use as a reagent to focus scroll's magic--their bracers should do nicely.$B$BA few intact bracers from the creatures should be enough. The other bracers will be useless for our purposes, but they may be worth something to a merchant if you wish to sell them. Once you have the intact bracers attempt to use the scroll. Return to me with the results and we shall proceed from there.
Objective: Collect 5 Intact Elemental Bracers and use the Divining Scroll on them. Afterwards, bring the Divined Scroll to Sentinel Velene Starstrike at the Silverwind Refuge.
