Title: The Magical Ailment
Description: With the Quel'dorei's accession to the Alliance, I do not doubt that it is only a matter of time before we rise to our former glory. But as my people celebrate, I must keep track of the problems that remain.$B$BFor years my people relied on the magic of the great fount called the Sunwell. Its destruction made us realize how dependent we became on its energies.$B$BWithout it, we are vulnerable to succumbing to magic addiction.$B$BMiraculously, the rangers who were hunting Dra'lox with you stumbled upon a mystical pool of restorative waters whose effects are reminiscent of the Sunwell.$B$BIf this is true, it could be our salvation. I need you to travel to Darnassus and ask Ashylah Starcaller if such waters can be procured for the Quel'dorei.
Objective: Travel to Darnassus and speak to Ashylah Starcaller.
