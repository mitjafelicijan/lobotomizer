Title: The Venture Co.
Description: This explains the buildup of Venture Co. employees and equipment we've seen in Mulgore. Those goblins... their company is expanding too quickly for their own good. It's how they say, show a goblin something, and you can hear the scales in the background.$b$bGreedy little things, they are. Unfortunately for their business enterprise, we tauren cannot allow them to conduct their operations in our lands. Go to their mine northeast of the ravaged caravan and send them a message.
Objective: Kill 14 Venture Co. Workers and 6 Venture Co. Supervisors for Morin Cloudstalker at Bloodhoof Village.
