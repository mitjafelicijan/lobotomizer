Title: Sap Their Strength
Description: Welcome, $C. We don't see many adventurers up this way â€” and not without reason.$B$BThe greed of the Venture Company has tainted the land itself. Every ancient tree that they fell only adds to my troubles.$B$BThe powerful sap that once nourished the trees of this forest now congeals into those awful sap beasts. Their corrosive nature harms the delicate balance we've fought to maintain here.$B$BWorse still, many have recently made their way to Stonetalon Peak itself! Their corrosive sap kills the herbs I need for cooking and simple potions.$B$B$C, venture forth and rid the Peak of these things. You'll find many just south of here, over the ridge that holds the old ruins. We've little enough use for coin up here, but perhaps a few potions might serve as payment?
Objective: Slay 10 Sap Beasts and 6 Corrosive Sap Beasts, then return to Innkeeper Faralia.
