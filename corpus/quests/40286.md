Title: The Search for the Blade
Description: The Temple of Arrkoran...$B$B<Katokar would seem almost distant for a moment as his mind thought>.$B$BThis must be the place $N, it must be. I have no other leads, venture deep within the Temple, and seek out his blade, if it is anywhere, then it must be there. You can find this temple far to the south east, it is massive, and cannot be missed. Be careful in your searching, I am sure a terrible evil lurks inside.
Objective: Search for the sword that could have belonged to a fallen Blademaster inside the Temple of Arrkoran.
