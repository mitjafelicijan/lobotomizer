Title: Old Greypaw
Description: For many long years our neighbor was that of a furbolg, he has grown aged over the last few years but was extremely wise. Old Greypaw often kept to himself, and minded his own business, often venturing over for a night time talk if he so needed the company.$B$BAs of lately I fear for his mental health, the other furbolg of the forest have begun to act irrationally, and I fear Greypaw may be succumbing to a similar fate. He has not stopped by in months, and has kept to his home to the north.$B$BHe has been aggresive to either me or Ardaen approaching and wishing to talk, but perhaps you may be able to speak with him, and ask if he is doing okay. It would certainly ease my mind to know an old friend is well.
Objective: Speak with Old Greypaw within Ashenvale for Daela Evermoon.
