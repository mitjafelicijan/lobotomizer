Title: Tears of the Poppy
Description: Sinu a'manore, $C.$B$BYou have answered our call for aid, for which we are truly grateful.$B$BWith the fall of Quel'Thalas we, the Quel'dorei, have been left without a home. It is here where we shall focus our wits and strengthen our will. This is the beginning of our quest for vengeance, and you shall be part of it, among others.$B$BYou see, as we prepare for a war against death itself we need to have as less casualties as possible but we can only prevent so many.$B$BWhere there is a battle there shall be dead and wounded. I ask of you on this day and many to come to aid us in our effort to supply our numbers with a means to mend and heal. There is a small and not so elegant flower growing in Redrige Mountains. We call it poppy. I shall not bore you with the alchemical details, you only need to know that the concoction will ease the pain of the wounded. I know it's a simple task  but it is not meaningless.$B$BReturn to me when you have a handful of them.
Objective: Gather ten poppies in Redridge Mountains.
