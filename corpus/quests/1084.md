Title: Wounded Ancients
Description: It seems obvious to me that the protectors of the Vale--the treants--had something to do with the Venture Co. being driven back. Unfortunately, even those once great guardians have now become corrupt.$B$BGaxim thinks their corruption is somehow linked to the weapons the goblins used during their retreat.$B$BI told him I'd collect a sample from a wounded treant and allow him to study it in order to figure out if that's true.$B$BBring me some of the shrapnel so the gnome can tell me more...
Objective: Bring a piece of Corroded Shrapnel to Kaela Shadowspear in Stonetalon.
