Title: Vulture's Vigor
Description: Death does indeed have wings in these blasted lands, $r. I have witnessed the black slayers and bonepickers feasting upon the corpse of many a fallen explorer - sometimes feeding upon the most vile and disease ridden of carcasses. It is a wonder, then, how their internal systems overcome the pestilence that claims these lands.$B$BAssist me in my studies, $N! Gizzards I need! Two snickerfang jowls will also be required for the base of the concoction.$B$BYou shall be rewarded two-fold for your efforts.
Objective: Bring ten Vulture Gizzards and two Snickerfang Jowls to Bloodmage Lynnore.
