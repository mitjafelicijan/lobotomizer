Title: Apple a Day
Description: I've only experienced a few blooms in my time, but this season, things are different. At the ends of my leaves, there are usually pink petals sprouting by now, but instead, my branches are barren! I don't think this is normal. Maybe a druid might know what's wrong with me? They're much older and wiser anyhow.
Objective: Inspect Applebough and help him grow back his fruit. Speak with a nearby druid to find out Applebough's ailment.
