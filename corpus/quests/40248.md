Title: Taming the Beast
Description: You and I were once citizens of Lordaeron, $N. We are no strangers to the forests, and likewise, to the wolves that lurked in the shadow of night. Terrified of their wailing howls.$B$BYet now, even they have succumb to the corruption of the Scourge plague, faring no better than we. As you can see, Blackpaw here is my loyal pet that I keep ever by my side, a darkhound I tamed by no special skill. The Forsaken need only sheer force of will to dominate.$B$BYou will find that the creatures of this land vary in how they respond to our... condition. While there are those who think nothing of the smell of death, some may seek to make a meal of a carcass like yours. For this reason, I have made special preparations for our Forsaken kin who seek a beast of their own.$B$BI do not impart this gift lightly, $N. Show me you can dominate wild beasts without it, first. Go, return with a Decrepit Darkhound.
Objective: Use the Taming Rod to tame a Decrepit Darkhound. Practice your skills, then return the Taming Rod to Liott Maneskin in Brill.
