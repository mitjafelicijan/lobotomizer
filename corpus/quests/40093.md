Title: The Tidemaster
Description: Our sister ship, the Tidemaster, was wrecked off the coast, and we suffered horrible casualties after grounding into Shank's Reef. The rocks ripped the ship apart, and murlocs attacked the crew. None survived to tell the tale. The ship was wonderful, and now it sits as a disfigured wreck within the Reef as if to disgrace Boralus.$B$BThere is nothing that we can do with the husk of the Tidemaster or its perished crew, but we still need to recover the logbook. I do not have the crew to risk, especially with the murlocs and rather hostile fish that tread the waters there. You will be the one to venture inside the wreckage and take the logbook from its chest. The information there cannot fall into our enemies' hands, or the pirates'.$B$BYou shall find what you're looking for to the northwest along the coast.
Objective: Venture within the Tidemaster in Shank's Reef and recover the Tidemaster's Logbook for Deckmaster Breachcrest in Caelan's Rest.
