Title: Gerenzo's Orders
Description: You know, I was once the second most important person here at this site. That all changed when Gerenzo took over. Fired my boss, Ziz Fizziks, and sent me down to work in the mines. Ziz told me to stay here and gather information, though. His new boss will pay us well if we can find out what Gerenzo's plans are.$b$bAnyways, what I do know is that Gerenzo has ordered large amounts of this gold-green ore to be mined. I can get you a sample to bring to Ziz, but you'll have to watch for patrols while I get it.
Objective: Get the mysterious ore from Piznik after he finishes mining it.
