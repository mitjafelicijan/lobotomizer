Title: A Call to Aid
Description: Supplies, soldiers? Where am I supposed to get these, much less how am I supposed to send them so far north? Things must be desperate if a Captain of the Army of Lordaeron claims to be the Leader of the Alliance.$B$BI have prepared my response, and sadly there is no way to meet his request, as stretched thin as we are. Bring this back to him, and may the light bless those that remain there.
Objective: Deliver Marcus Jonathan's Letter to Captain Silas at the Remnants Camp in Tirisfal Uplands.
