Title: Wild Leather Vest
Description: Wild Leather vests are the staple of any Wild Leather armor set.The frame of the vest blends with the wildvine to produce a product that offers maximum protection of the torso while allowing for the potent magic to work its way through the garment.$B$BFor this pattern, I will require two Turtle Scale breastplates, two sets of Turtle Scale gloves, and a wildvine.It's a tall order, but one you should have little difficulty in filling for me.
Objective: Bring 2 Turtle Scale Breastplates, 2 Turtle Scale Gloves, and a Wildvine to Pratt McGrubben in Feathermoon Stronghold.
