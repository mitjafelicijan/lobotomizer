Title: Garments of the Moon
Description: I need your help, $N. I am needed here to train the other students, but you, you can help one of our injured Sentinels just south of Dolanaar. She was hurt patrolling the town and could use our aid. Her name is Shaya.$B$BWhen you find her, heal her wounds, and then fortify her body with your spells. This will at least protect her from harm longer if she finds trouble. Return to me here after you've done your duty to Elune.
Objective: Find Sentinel Shaya and heal her wounds using Lesser Heal (Rank 2). Afterwards, grant her Power Word: Fortitude and then return to Laurna Morninglight in Dolanaar.
