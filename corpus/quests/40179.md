Title: Exterminate the Rat
Description: So it seems these Blackwater fools sent some rat to keep track of our mates. He already asked someone to scuttle one of our new captains, although to be fair that orc was an idiot. Blood fer blood! I wants ye to go meet Morgan the Storm 'n spit in his face. Bring me his head. Ye can find him on the Eastern beach where most of me mates set anchor.
Objective: Kill Morgan the Storm and bring his head to Garfield Sparkleblast.
