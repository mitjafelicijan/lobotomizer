Title: Beached Sea Creature
Description: The remains of a giant thresher - much larger than one you'd expect to find in Darkshore - lie beached on the coast of the Mist's Edge.How this creature came to be here is unknown; the group of murlocs that now feast off the carcass of it seem to be much too weak, even in large numbers, to have brought down the beast. $B$BWhile some of it has been picked clean, enough of it remains to take a sample for Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine to study.
Objective: Take the Sea Creature Bones to Gwennyth Bly'Leggonde in Auberdine.
