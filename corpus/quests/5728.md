Title: Hidden Enemies
Description: Hmm, leaders of the Searing Blade... this concerns me most. If they are the ones of value to Neeru, then those are who we must target first. This satyr... Bazzalan, and the other Neeru mentioned--what was he, a warlock?--must be slain.$B$BReturn to the Cleft of Shadow and enter Ragefire Chasm, $N. Find these two leaders of the Searing Blade, and kill them. But be careful not to let Neeru know it was you who did this. You must retain your identity as one of his $gbrothers:sisters; in arms.
Objective: Kill Bazzalan and Jergosh the Invoker before returning to Thrall in Orgrimmar.
