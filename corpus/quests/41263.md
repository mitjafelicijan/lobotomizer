Title: A Holy Duty
Description: As devoted servants of the Holy Light, it is both our duty and privilege to extend our care to those less fortunate. The weight of the suffering borne by the children of Quel'Thalas in the aftermath of our fallen kingdom often eludes our consciousness.$B$BMany young ones have become orphans, and it is incumbent upon us to provide solace and support for them. Even if your destiny leads you down different paths, your assistance can still make a significant impact. Retrieve for me an Ivory Hawkstrider bone, and with it, we shall fashion a toyâ€”a delicate figurine. This small creation will serve as a source of comfort for the children, aiding them in overcoming the traumatic memories they have endured.
Objective: Bring an Ivory Hawkstider Bone to Taliren Lightborn in Ballador's Chapel.
