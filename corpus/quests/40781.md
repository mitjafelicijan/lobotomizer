Title: Further Inquiries About Legend
Description: Next up, I want you to talk to the Dwarven, Goblin, and Ice Troll storytellers. Yeah I know, Ice trolls aren't the nicest bunch but I wanna know more about their version. Like before, pay attention, if we are to investigate this legend then every detail may be crucial!
Objective: Inquire about Greatfather winter from the Dwarf Storyteller, the Goblin Storyteller, and the Ice Troll Storyteller for Mulin Snowbeard in Winter Veil Vale.
