Title: The Missing Diplomat
Description: Defias activity? Well, there's always some activity; even if they keep to themselves we consider them a threat.$B$BBut now that I think about it, there was a recent sighting that seemed odd. It must have been a couple weeks ago, but some of their agents had gathered around Addle's Stead. From the report, I'd guessed something big went down.$B$BWhy don't you check there first and bring me back anything you find?$B$BThe farmstead is south of the road from Westfall just as you enter Duskwood.
Objective: Find the Defias Docket and return it to Watcher Backus in Duskwood.
