Description: The SI:7 have means of communication that reach us quite fast and believe it or not they are very reliable.$B$BSparing you any further details you should know that a dwarven caravan that was meant to reach Aerie Peak never made it out of the Wetlands.$B$BThe caravan lays in ruins and you can only find the mutilated husks of what used to be dwarves.$B$BOur agents already poked around the zone but failed to find anything, they are currently trying to localize these newly recruited Scarlet zealots.$B$BI'm not very sure how much of a detective you believe yourself to be, but I ask you to take a second look, maybe they missed something.$B$BIf you find the recruits, keep in mind that we aren't sure what manner of persuasion the Scarlets used to brainwash them, spare as many as you can and take them to Menethil.
Objective: Follow the Caravan's route and look for clues.
