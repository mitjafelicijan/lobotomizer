Title: The Terror of Chill Breeze
Description: I enjoy camping in this cave, but as long as Old Icebeard makes his home near this area then I'll never be safe from him raiding my food. It would make for a great trophy if you could bring me his beard... not to mention making this place safer.
Objective: Tundra MacGrann has asked you to kill Old Icebeard and collect its beard.
