Title: A Vile Mantle
Description: I don't know your face, $r, I don't like new faces. There's enough trouble in these forests without outlanders dragging theirs along.$B$BBut you're here now, curse it all. The Master says it is all part of the Wolf Serpent's will and who is foolish wee me to disagree? Thus, I say you should help with your part.$B$BIt gets pretty cold up here in Gilneas and we pellars need clothes as much as anyone. Track down the Vilewing Bats and the Duskpelt Wolves, then bring me their furs. You'll find them almost anywhere in this country, but the closest are to the southwest.
Objective: Gather 5 Vilewing Pelts and 5 Duskpelt Furs for Bearbane at the cave above Mossgrove Farm in Gilneas.
