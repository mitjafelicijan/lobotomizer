Title: Hydrocondensor Modulator
Description: I have been expecting a shipment from Tinker Town for a few days now. You see, a lot of our rare materials were sent over here once we got things settled. A lot of my work on these access panels needs a Hydrocondensor Modulator, but it was stolen on the trip here by a group of leper gnomes. They ransacked quite a few valuable goods.$B$BNow, getting hold of a new one is not an easy task. We could only construct them in Gnomeregan, so unless you want to go digging through that trogg infested ruin, I suggest you look for the one that got stolen. Try rooting around the old houses to the south of here, no doubt they have it stashed somewhere safe.
Objective: Find the Hydrocondensor Modulator for Technician Stormlight at the Gnomeregan Reclamation Facility in Dun Morogh.
