Title: The Galak Messenger
Description: Our vigil does not end. $B$BThe Centaur tribes infesting Thousand Needles have been steadily growing more brazen with each passing day, their scouts boldly encroaching on our sacred lands. For now, they content themselves with harassing others, but it is only a matter of time before these abominations set their sights on our town.$B$BMy scouts have reported the presence of a Centaur messenger, bearing news between the warlords of these lands. We cannot allow them to continue to scheme and plot against us unchecked. We must discover their plans, and we must do so quickly.$B$BI trust that you possess the necessary skills to eliminate this messenger and seize any messages that they bear. I have no patience for failure.
Objective: Find and retrieve the Centaur Missive from Galak Messenger for Commander Anashya Starfall in Thalanaar.
