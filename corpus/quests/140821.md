Title: Strategic Strike
Description: Listen up, soldiers! Our scouts have identified one of the orcs' battlefield leaders. He is an extraordinarily bloodthirsty and cunning blademaster by the name of Axun. Take a company of men, and search for him. The sooner we eliminate this menace, the better our chances of holding the line. We must not let these savages advance further into human lands.
Objective: Search the battlefield for Blademaster Axun and slay him.
