Title: The Great Silver Deceiver
Description: It is said that truesilver is stronger and more durable than mithril. Galvan does not disagree with this assessment of the minerals, but contrary to its name, truesilver is not true! Mithril is a far nobler mineral! HAH! Regardless, for this lesson you will need to find the great silver deceiver, $N.$B$BBring me forty bars of mithril and five bars of truesilver. In exchange, you will be taught the secret of ornate mithril gloves and more importantly, learn that truesilver is a liar!
Objective: Bring forty Mithril Bars and five Truesilver Bars to Galvan the Ancient in Stranglethorn.
