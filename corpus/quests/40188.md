Title: The Lost Crew
Description: That damn Zeppelin caught fire as we were going over this uncharted island, and lucky for us we didn't just hit the open seas! We lost quite a lot of crew members but I do know that Blazno jumped off before the crash. I don't know for sure what happened to him, but I'd like you to find out one way or another.$B$BHe's a crafty one that Blazno is, no doubt he was able to figure out something away from the rest of us, if anything my bet is he is somewhere near where the crash site is at, look around there - you'll find our wreckage by the Maul'ogg Post, just south west of here near the Canyon.
Objective: Search for signs of what happened to Blazno Blastpipe in Gillijim's Island.
