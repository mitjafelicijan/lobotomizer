Title: Defunct Mainframes
Description: I have quite a problem on my hands here. A bad batch of mainframes has sent a lot of the Whirling Whizzbots into disarray!$B$BAll they do now is aimlessly wander instead of doing their work. What's worse is that they are constantly getting in the way of production, and I have Kizzcrack up my rear to fix the issue.$B$BDo you think you could do me a solid and collect the Defunct Mainframes from the Whirling Whizzbots? If I can take a look at them, perhaps I can think of a solution that wouldn't require me to destroy each and every one I have made. Six should do just fine.
Objective: Recover 6 Defunct Mainframes from the Whirling Whizzbots around the Black Ash Coalpits for Balnack Copperlight.
