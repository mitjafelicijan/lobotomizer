Title: A Short Incubation
Description: The Moonweavers, huh? Most intriguing. I wish the sprite darters could truly appreciate what it means to have those two look after them. They are both quite capable.$B$BSo, they gave you the egg as a gift. Well, then you should be responsible for it for as long as you desire. It appears it's almost ready to hatch, but we should ensure it's healthy and no damage has been done to it.$B$BI only need two elixirs of fortitude for a small spell to protect the egg. I have the rest of the components here with me.
Objective: Bring 2 Elixir of Fortitudes to Quentin in Thousand Needles.
