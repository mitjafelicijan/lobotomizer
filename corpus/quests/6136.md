Description: Past the Argent Dawn encampment of Light's Hope and west of Northdale, you will find the corpulent maggot beast, Borelgore.$B$BI've lost entire regiments to that monster. His size knows no bounds! The more he eats the greater his girth becomes...$B$BWhile I would not suffer any emotional harm should the beast devour you, I would prefer that you were the victor. I recommend you enlist the help of others for this mission. Borelgore has been known to devour small battalions foolish enough to attack him.
Objective: Find Borelgore in the northern wastes of Eastern Plaguelands and destroy him. Return to Nathanos Blightcaller when the mission is complete.
