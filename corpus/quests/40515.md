Title: It broke...
Description: I just can't seem to get it to work!$B$BI've managed to fix it once as we took it from Silvermoon to Farstrider Lodge. And it worked on the journey here, but I simply can't understand what's wrong with it! It might've been damaged.$B$BArcane Golems aren't an easy thing to build or repair. If only my master would still be alive. Wait, that's it! I remember Thalestien, my master gave his notes to a friend of his in Gnomeregan. He was so enthralled by the gnomish inventors that he gave Masey Wirefuse his notes, hoping that the gnomes would at one point improve his work.$B$BSee if you can find her in Tinker Town, I truly hope she survived Gnomeregan, or else I'm doomed.
Objective: Speak to Masey Wirefuse in Tinker Town, Ironforge.
