Title: Seek Help Elsewhere
Description: It's like nothing I have ever seen before, $N.$BIt's like the very essence of the Light comes out of this orb, a strange thing that the Ashbringer left behind as he was freed from the clutches of the Scourge.$BI really cannot spare any time to aid you with this. Even if the Dread Citadel fell we still have a long way to go. While the Arch Lich has been defeated we have yet to find his phylactery.$BThe Argent Dawn is a mess, the casualties were many and the rest of us are beyond tired. While you will not find help here, I know where to send you, and I am sure he will be able to help.$BSeek Tirion Fordring, here, in Eastern Plaguelands to the West.$BI am truly sorry and I wish you luck.
Objective: Find Tirion Fordring in Eastern Plaguelands.
