Title: The Terrible Krampus
Description: Tinsel lost his gloves a while ago and a bunch of friendly revelers helped him get them back! But with the return of his gloves, my suspicions have been confirmed. There is only one creature in this world that can summon the grell here, in the Vale and it seems his time to haunt Azeroth has come once more.$B$BGreatfather Winter's nemesis, Krampus! An angry spirit that shows up every winter to steal all presents from Azeroth! Luckily for us, he can't manifest himself in the Vale and Greatfather Winter gave me the means to find his location, which is more or less accurate.$B$BReturn the gifts to us, the celebrations must not end! But remember, Krampus is a spirit, he will not really die, and be sure that he will return next year. He can be found somewhere in Winterspring, more than likely somewhere dark, and festering of his demonic kin.
Objective: Slay the evil Krampus, and recover the Sack of Stolen Gifts for Mr. Mistle Toe in Winter Veil Vale!
