Title: Treats for Training
Description: Greetings, $c. Were you sent by my sister? My brother? No? Who might you be, then?$B$B$N, is it? Allow me to introduce myself: I am Alleana Moonfeather youngest of the Moonfeather family. My siblings already wear the mantle of Hippogryph Master, but I am finding it difficult to focus on my training since my mentor...$B$BNevertheless, I must press on, for my family's reputation and in my mentor's memory! Without proper guidance, however, it is quite difficult to gauge my methods. We raise fledgling hippogryphs from a young age, so they bond to us and rely wholly upon our guidance.$B$BMake no mistake, these children belong to nature first and foremost, but the Kaldorei share a bond with nature that allows us to commune with these younglings effectively. Yet these fledglings seem indifferent towards me. Perhaps it is their diet.$B$BIt would be of great help if you could gather some food from the creatures in Darkshore and Ashenvale for me.
Objective: Bring 5 Chunks of Crawler Marrow, 5 Heaven Peaches, 5 Bear Viscera, and 5 Giant Strider Wings to Alleana Moonfeather in Forest Song.
