Title: Fuel for the Zapping
Description: If I bet against my own better judgment and stay to run an engineering shop along the Forgotten Coast, I will need to deal with these pesky elementals.Curse the powers of elementalism unchecked, I say!$B$BFortunately for me, and now for you my hopeful agent provocateur, the elementals represent an ideal source of raw power for my Ultra-Shrinker refinement - give them the what-for I say!When doing this though, be sure to save me the water elemental cores!
Objective: Collect 10 Water Elemental Cores from the Sea Elementals and Sea Sprays along the Forgotten Coast of Feralas, and bring them back to Zorbin Fandazzle who is near the dock there.
