Title: ... and Bugs
Description: Another component of my new recipe is the shelled leg of a giant crab.And the crabs they have in Dustwallow -- Muckshells they call them -- just won't do!I'm afraid the only suitable crabs live far away, in the Swamp of Sorrows.$B$BThe shell of the crab leg is a key element of the dish's presentation so I need pristine, unscarred legs.An adult crab might only have one or two such legs, and I need a lot in order to research my dish.$B$BSo, $N... are you willing to travel?
Objective: Bring 12 Pristine Crawler Legs to Morgan Stern in Theramore.
