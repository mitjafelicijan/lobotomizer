Title: The Shadowforge Captain
Description: Have you seen a chicken with its head cut off, $r? It runs around, aimless, panicking, before finally dropping dead. When you head to Angor Fortress, to the north east, strike deep into it. Go for the one who organises them, and the rest who survive will be just as aimless as the beheaded bird.$B$BBarlgruf is his name. He will not be alone, nor will he be accommodating, so strike first and strike hard. Return to me when he lies in a puddle of his own blood.
Objective: Slay Captain Barlgruf in Angor Fortress for Warlord Goretooth at Kargath in the Badlands.
