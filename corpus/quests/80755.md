Title: Training the Beast
Description: Yes, yes, I understand why Liott sent you to me. Without that incantation, you would have had quite the struggle taming all but the most indiscriminate of beasts. Now you may tame living creatures the world over!$B$BBut you must know that is not enough. You must realize that the true power of the creatures you turn to your whims lies in bestowing them the talents you observe in the wild. It is not enough to simply sic a wild animal upon your foes.$B$BIf you wish to tap into the true potential of your pets, then speak to me once again. I will spare no detail in enlightening you in the ways of the beast master.
Objective: Speak with Diane Willowfield in the War Quarter of the Undercity.
