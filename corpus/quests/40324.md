Title: The Legend of Tarqsiku
Description: When my people first came to this island, we met a being named Tarqsiku. He was made of pure ice, and assisted us in our times of great need. Tarqsiku has long since fallen into a dark place, rumbling deep beneath the the ground, and sending the Whiteclaw into frenzy.$B$BAn evil has clouded his judgement, and his mind, already he has attacked our kind. Tarqsiku was a legend to my ancestors, but to me, Tarqsiku is a threat, and one that has me wondering what to do.$B$BI ask of you to venture deep into the earth, to find Tarqsiku, and to free him for his torment.
Objective: Find Tarqsiku deep beneath Kaneq'nuun and slay him for Panukuki.
