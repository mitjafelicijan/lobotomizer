Title: Words of Wisdom
Description: They still aren't responding to me! How is it my siblings make it look so simple? How very infuriating!$B$B<Her ears prick and she bares her fangs when she fails to summon one of the fledglings to her side.>$B$BMy Shan'do would tell me to set aside my pride, I'm sure of it. His was always the way of patience. I implore you, $N, seek out Hippogryph Masters and request their counsel on these willful children. Spare no detail of my struggles, as much as it pains me to admit that I am in need of their aid.$B$BWait! Do not speak to Caylais or Fyldren! I cannot accept what could only be seen as preferential treatment.$B$BI would urge you to travel to Rut'theran Village and Astranaar, and I believe I received correspondence from Nijel's Point once, wherever that may be. Teloren on Stonetalon Peak I am certain would help me in this, but be mindful of his... tendency to ramble.
Objective: Seek out Kaldorei Hippogryph Masters and request their counsel.
