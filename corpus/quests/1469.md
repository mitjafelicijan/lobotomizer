Title: Rhapsody's Tale
Description: Before the flight, I drank me a whole keg of stout. Hiccup!$b$bAnd what a flight it was. Zipping around with Brohann following me. Didn't see no temple though. Hiccup!$b$bWell, didn't see no temple till I got a little too tipsy and fell off my mount. I plunged right into the water and was sucked down. Found myself surrounded by a bunch of creepy trolls. Sure swam out of there fast! Even made off with this troll souvenir. Here, take it to Brohann and let him know his temple is down there, indeed. Hiccup!
Objective: Bring the Atal'ai Tablet Fragment to Brohann Caskbelly in Stormwind.
