Zandalar Tribe Hub Location
---------------------------

The Zandalar Tribe can be found in **Stranglethorn Vale**, on the **Yojamba Isle**, found west of the **Zuuldaia Ruins**. You can reach the island by either passing through the **Zuuldaia Ruins** or swimming to it directly from either the **Booty Bay** or the **Grom’ Gol Base Camp**.

[![yojamba isle zandalar tribe reputation hub](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Yojamba-Isle-Zandalar-Tribe-Reputation-Hub-1024x576.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Yojamba-Isle-Zandalar-Tribe-Reputation-Hub.jpg)

Yojamba Isle – Zandalar Tribe

**Yojamba Isle** serves as the primary hub for the vendors and quest givers tied to the Zandalar Tribe, meaning that you will often find yourself visiting the location before and after raiding **[Zul’Gurub](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/zg/)**.

Zandalar Tribe Reputation Farming
---------------------------------

There are multiple ways to increase your reputation with the Zandalar Tribe, with all of the available ways being tied to the **[Zul’Gurub](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/zg/)** raid. The main ways of increasing your reputation are: killing mobs & bosses, completing repeatable quests, and using special tokens.

If you wish to gain more information about the raid and increase your overall knowledge, check out our dedicated **[Zul’Gurub Raid Guide](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/zg/)**.

### Killing Mobs & Bosses in Zul’Gurub

Every single mob and boss in **[Zul’Gurub](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/zg/)** offers a reputation increase toward the Zandalar Tribe when slain. However, the reputation you gain is different depending on the mob or boss itself, with each of them granting a specific amount, increasing as you progress through the raid. Killing the last boss of the raid, **Hakkar**, will land you the highest amount of Reputation you can gain from a single mob, offering 400 Zandalar Tribe Reputation.

If you wish to gain the maximum amount of Reputation with the Zandalar Tribe, you should attempt to clear all the mobs in the raid on every single raid lockout. Additionally, you should specifically hunt “Speaker” mobs, which are a special type of trash mob that grants an increased reputation compared to the rest of the trash mobs.

**List of Reputation Gain per Mob/Boss:**

* **Non-Specific Trash Mob**: 5 Zandalar Tribe Reputation
* “**Speaker” Trash Mob**: 15 Zandalar Tribe Reputation
* **Gri’lek**, **Renataki**, **Hazza’rah**, **Wushoolay**: 25 Zandalar Tribe Reputation
* **High Priest Venoxis**, **High Priestess Jeklik**, **High Priest Thekal**, **High Priestess Arlokk**, **Gahz’ranka**: 100 Zandalar Tribe Reputation
* **Bloodlord Mandokir**, **Jin’do the Hexxer**: 200 Zandalar Tribe Reputation
* **Hakkar**: 400 Zandalar Tribe Reputation

### Zandalar Tribe Quests

There are two types of quests that you can acquire to increase your reputation with the Zandalar Tribe: repeatable Troll Tribes Coin quests and a “one-time” Bijou quest. The Coin quests are repeatable while the “Bijous” can be endlessly used, providing two valuable ways to increase your reputation while also gaining valuable tokens. The tokens can be used to further increase your reputation gain or be exchanged for special items at the **Yojamba Isle** Zandalar Tribe Hub.

All of the quests related to the Zandalar Tribe are handed out by **Vinchaxa**, with the NPC representing both a starting point and a completion point for the quests!

[![vinchaxa npc](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vinchaxa-NPC-1024x576.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vinchaxa-NPC.jpg)

#### One Time Quest & Bijous

Besides the repeatable quests which are tied to the Zandalar Tribe rep farm, you can complete a one-time quest that will allow you to use “Bijous” found during your **[Zul’Gurub](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/zg/)** raids.

The quest is called **A Bijou for Zanza** and can be picked up from **Vinchaxa**, tasking you with finding one of the Troll Bijous in Zul’Gurub and destroying them on the **Altar of Zanza**.

[![altar of zanza zandalar tribe reputation](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Altar-of-Zanza-Zandalar-Tribe-Reputation-1024x576.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Altar-of-Zanza-Zandalar-Tribe-Reputation.jpg)

Altar of Zanza – Yojamba Isle

**List of Troll Bijous found in Zul’Gurub:**

* [Red Hakkari Bijou](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19707)
* [Purple Hakkari Bijou](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19712)
* [Bronze Hakkari Bijou](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19713)
* [Blue Hakkari Bijou](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19708)
* [Green Hakkari Bijou](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19711)
* [Silver Hakkari Bijou](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19714)
* [Gold Hakkari Bijou](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19715)
* [Orange Hakkari Bijou](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19710)
* [Yellow Hakkari Bijou](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19709)

Completing the A Bijou for Zanza quest will award you with 150 Zandalar Tribe Reputation and a [Zandalar Honor Token](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19858)! While this may not seem much considering the quest can only be completed once, completing the quest as soon as possible is highly recommended. This is because by completing the **A Bijou for Zanza** quest, you will be able to use any of the Troll Bijous on the **Altar of Zanza**, allowing you to gain 75 Zandalar Tribe Reputation each time you destroy a Troll Bijou at the altar. Destroying the Bijous will also grant you a [Zandalar Honor Token](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19858) per destroyed Bijou, meaning that you can use this method to quickly reach Exalted with the Zandalar Tribe.

#### Repeatable Troll Tribe Coin Quests

The **[Zul’Gurub](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/zg/)** raid features 9 different types of coins that can be looted from the mobs! Those 9 different types of coins belong to the different Troll Tribes, serving as the main objective for one of the 3 Coin Quests offered by **Vinchaxa**. Each Coin quest is repeatable, meaning that you can gather multiple coins and turn them in at the same time.

**Troll Coins**:

* [Razzashi Coin](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19699)
* [Hakkari Coin](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19700)
* [Witherbark Coin](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19703)
* [Vilebranch Coin](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19702)
* [Gurubashi Coin](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19701)
* [Bloodscalp Coin](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19706)
* [Sandfury Coin](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19704)
* [Zulian Coin](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19698)
* [Skullsplitter Coin](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19705)

**Troll Tribe Coin Quests**:

* **[Sandfury, Skullsplitter, and Bloodscalp Coins](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/8239)**
* **[Zulian, Razzashi, and Hakkari Coins](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/8195)**
* **[Gurubashi, Vilebranch, and Witherbark Coins](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/8238)**

Each time you complete any of the 3 quests you will be rewarded with a [Zandalar Honor Token](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19858) and 25 Zandalar Tribe Reputation!

### Zandalar Honor Tokens

The [Zandalar Honor Token](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19858)s are considered the best way to gain a fast reputation increase with the Zandalar Tribe considering you are lucky enough to either gain multiple coins for the repeatable quests or if you are fortunate enough to stack a large amount of Troll Bijous. Although it is advised to use as many [Zandalar Honor Token](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19858)s as possible to gain an increased reputation quickly, it is also advised to stack them since most of the important rewards offered by the Zandalar Tribe require them.

Zandalar Tribe Rewards
----------------------

Gaining an increased reputation with the Zandalar Tribe lands many rewards to players, offering them the chance to buy many patterns and recipes, along with many other goodies. Increasing the Zandalar Tribe Reputation leads to many powerful rewards, among which, you can gain specific Class set items and special Shoulder Enchantments. You will also be able to buy special potions.

Most of the items that can be acquired on the Yojamba Isle are sold by **Rin’wosho the Trader**! While being at a Neutral standing with the Zandalar Tribe, Rin’wosho will have a considerable amount of items that he offers, with his inventory of available goods expanding further as you further increase your reputation. You won’t be able to see the special goods that he can sell such as the special Shoulder Enchantments unless you have Exalted Reputation with the Zandalar Tribe.
