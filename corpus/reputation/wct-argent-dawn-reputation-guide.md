The [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529) faction plays a primary role in the downfall of [Naxxramas](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/naxxramas/) and the **Scourge** forces that inhabit **Eastern** and **Western Plaguelands**. Historically, the Argent Dawn is an organization created by priests and paladins, governed by Tirion Fordring, welcoming anyone who dares to stand against the influence of the Burning Legion and the Lich King.

The faction is directly tied to the attunement process of the [Naxxramas](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/naxxramas/) raid!

Argent Dawn Hubs
----------------

Unlike other factions, [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529) has three distinct hubs that players can visit, seek safe haven, and interact with NPCs! Each one of the hubs has an [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529) Quartermaster available, however, one of the three distinct hubs acts as the main base of operations which offers the majority of quests and rewards.

### Light’s Hope Chapel (Main Hub) – Eastern Plaguelands

The main hub for the [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529) is the **Light’s Hope Chapel**, hosting many of the main members of the faction. This spot is where most of the important quests related to the [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529) can be picked up and where players can interact with one of the quartermasters and pick up their Tier Set armors! [Quartermaster Miranda Breechlock](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11536) serves as the faction quartermaster of this area.

[![light's hope chapel main hub](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Lights-Hope-Chapel-Main-Hub-1024x537.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Lights-Hope-Chapel-Main-Hub.jpg)

Light’s Hope Chapel – Argent Dawn Main Hub

### The Bulwark (Secondary Hub) – Tirisfal Glades

**The Bulwark** is one of the two secondary hubs of the [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529) faction, mainly serving as the Horde-oriented camp. This spot can also be accessed by Alliance players for its quartermaster, although it is difficult due to the Horde Elite Npcs in the area. The spot is predominantly reserved for Horde players who can pick up quests related to [Scholomance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scholomance) and **Western Plaguelands**. [Argent Quartermaster Hasana](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/10856) serves as the quartermaster of this area.

[![argent dawn the bulwark secondary hub](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Argent-Dawn-The-Bulwark-Secondary-Hub-1024x522.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Argent-Dawn-The-Bulwark-Secondary-Hub.jpg)

The Bulwark – Argent Dawn Secondary Hub

### Chillwind Camp (Secondary Hub) – Western Plaguelands

**Chillwind Camp** is the third available hub for the [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529) faction, acting as a secondary hub. The hub acts as an Alliance-oriented camp, providing players access to one of the three faction quartermasters and quests related to **Western Plaguelands** and [Scholomance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scholomance). Similarly to **The Bulwark**, Horde players can interact with the quartermaster but will have a tough due to the Alliance NPCs in the area. [Argent Quartermaster Lightspark](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/10857) serves as the quartermaster of this area.

[![chillwind camp argent dawn secondary hub](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Chillwind-Camp-Argent-Dawn-Secondary-Hub-1024x537.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Chillwind-Camp-Argent-Dawn-Secondary-Hub.jpg)

Argent Dawn Reputation Farming
------------------------------

Players can farm reputation for the [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529) in many ways such as killing mobs and bosses in specific dungeons, open world mob grinding, completing various one-time and special repeatable quests, and participating in the **Scourge Invasion** event! All methods are viable, however, dungeon grinding has been proven to be the fastest and most optimal way of increasing reputation with the [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529)!

Upon encountering the [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529), all players have their reputation status set to Neutral upon encountering the faction.

* Neutral (0/3000)
* Friendly (0/6000)
* Honored (0/12000)
* Revered (0/21000)
* Exalted

### Scourgestones & Open World Mob Grinding

Any Undead mob in the open world found inside the **Western Plaguelands** and **Eastern Plaguelands** areas will give reputation toward the [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529) faction when slain. The reputation points are different based on the type of mob slain, but most mobs give similar points, except Rare and Elite mobs.

However, grinding mobs in the open world has limitations since they will stop granting reputation points once players reach Honored. The only mobs that can be farmed past Honored are the Rare and Elite mobs in the open world.

Players can also pick up an [Argent Dawn Commission](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12846) trinket from any of the [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529) hubs which will allow them to collect **Scourgestones**! While wearing the [Argent Dawn Commission](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12846) trinket, all Undead monsters killed by players in Eastern Plaguelands, Western Plaguelands, [Scholomance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scholomance), and [Stratholme Living](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/stratholme-living) & [Stratholme Undead](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/stratholme-undead) will drop **Scourgestones**.

Players can collect 3 distinct types of **Scourgestones**: [Minion’s Scourgestone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12840), [Invader’s Scourgestone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12841), and [Corruptor’s Scourgestone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12843). The first two types can drop from normal Undead, having their drop chance conditioned by the level and type the mob has.

* [Minion’s Scourgestone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12840) – All Undead (Lvl 50+)
* [Invader’s Scourgestone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12841) – All Undead (Lvl 54+)
* [Corruptor’s Scourgestone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12843) – Rare & Elites, Named Mobs

Those **Scourgestones** can be exchanged at **Light’s Hope Chapel** for [Argent Dawn Valor Token](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12844)s by talking to [Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11039). Each [Argent Dawn Valor Token](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12844) grants 25 x [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529) reputation. This method is tied to one of the two main repeatable quests!

Because of how the mob grinding reputation works, players advise that it’s highly important to keep all [Argent Dawn Valor Token](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12844)s for grinding reputation from Revered to Exalted! It is advised to complete dungeon runs as often as possible and quests besides farming open world mobs until the Revered reputation status.

### Dungeon Farming (Scholomance & Stratholme)

Two dungeons in the game are mainly farmed to increase reputation with the [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529): [Scholomance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scholomance) and Stratholme ([Stratholme Living](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/stratholme-living) & [Stratholme Undead](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/stratholme-undead)). As mentioned, the dungeon farming method is proven to be the fastest route for increasing reputation, with [Scholomance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scholomance) providing the best reputation points per hour. Both mobs and bosses grant reputation, so full clears are advised! However, mobs will only give reputation until you reach Revered while bosses will continue to give reputation until Exalted.

In addition, all mobs and bosses have the chance to drop **Scourgestones** just like all of the Undead in the **Western Plaguelands** and **Eastern Plaguelands** areas!

Scholomance – Argent Dawn Reputation Farm

[![stratholme argent dawn dungeon reputation farm](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stratholme-Argent-Dawn-Dungeon-Reputation-Farm-1024x537.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Stratholme-Argent-Dawn-Dungeon-Reputation-Farm.jpg)

Stratholme – Argent Dawn Reputation Farm

It’s important to remember that all mobs and bosses in the dungeons have a chance to drop a variant of the three **Scourgestones**, so having the [Argent Dawn Commission](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12846) trinket equipped can speed up the process immensely.

### One-Time Quests (Open World & Raid)

Most of the quests from **Western Plaguelands** and **Eastern Plaguelands** grant reputation with the [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529) but other areas grant it as well! Areas such as **Blackfathom Deeps**, **Burning Steppes**, and **Desolace** also feature quests that give reputation. The quests related to the Naxxramas raid grant a decent amount of reputation as well! However, since there are more than 100 individual quests that grant reputation, you can click the button below to see each quest in our database instead of displaying them in a table!

Lastly, remember that all Tier Set quests from [Naxxramas](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/naxxramas/) grant the same reputation, 200 x [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529) reputation points no matter which item we talk about!

### Repeatable Quests

Two main types of repeatable quests can be completed for [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529) reputation: **Scourgestones** and **Cauldron** quests. We explained the former a bit earlier, referring to the [Argent Dawn Commission](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12846) trinket and the [Minion’s Scourgestone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12840), [Invader’s Scourgestone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12841), and [Corruptor’s Scourgestone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12843). All of them can be turned in to [Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11039) in exchange for [Argent Dawn Valor Token](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12844)s which can be used to increase reputation, no matter what reputation status the player has. The latter method is represented by four different **Scourge Cauldrons** on the main farms in **Western Plaguelands**. Each cauldron grants a repeatable material turn-in quest that can be spammed indefinitely, no matter what reputation status the player has. The cauldron quests can only be accessed once their respective **Cauldron Lords** are killed and their keys are used on the cauldrons!

Argent Dawn Rewards
-------------------

The [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529) offers multiple rewards such as profession recipes, resistance enchantments, frost resistance gear, and other rare and epic items! Most rewards tied to the profession recipes and the resistance enchantments can be acquired from the quartermasters who share the same inventory. However, [Quartermaster Miranda Breechlock](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11536) will offer more rewards through a series of quests. In addition, players will also be able to pick up the frost resistance gear recipes from [Craftsman Wilhelm](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/16376) at the [Argent Dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/529) main hub, **Light’s Hope Chapel** after they acquire [Omarion’s Handbook](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/22719) and start the questline.

### Armaments of Battle Items

Besides the frost resistance gear and profession recipes, players can also gain quite a few rare and epic items from [Quartermaster Miranda Breechlock](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11536). All the quests grant the same rewards but the main difference between them is the amount of materials required to complete the quests, with each level of reputation status
