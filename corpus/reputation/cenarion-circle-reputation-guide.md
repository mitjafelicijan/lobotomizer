The [Cenarion Circle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/609) is a druid faction serving as a neutral haven for members of the Alliance and Horde. They play a vital role in Silithus and the defense against the Ahn’Qiraj forces, serving as one of the main forces fighting against the influence of the Old Gods and Qiraji. The [Cenarion Circle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/609) also acts as the main quest-givers for the **Silithus** area, providing players with many end-game quests.

Cenarion Circle Main Hub
------------------------

**Cenarion Hold** is the main hub for the [Cenarion Circle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/609), hosting many NPCs that offer players multiple quests and rewards. The hub can be found almost in the central spot of **Silithus**, placed right underneath **Hive’Ashi**. The spot also acts as the main base of operation of the area, offering a Flight Point and many NPCs that can repair gear or sell consumables.

[![cenarion circle main hub](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Cenarion-Circle-Main-Hub-1024x540.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Cenarion-Circle-Main-Hub.jpg)

Cenarion Circle Reputation Farming
----------------------------------

Reputation with the [Cenarion Circle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/609) can be farmed by killing mobs, completing one-time and repeatable quests, participating in the [Ahn’Qiraj War Effort](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/ahnqiraj-war-effort-guide/) event, and summoning & defeating the Abyssal Lords. Farming the reputation of the [Cenarion Circle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/609) is daunting due to how the mob-grinding part works, however, the quests make the farm considerably easier. Unlike other factions, where mobs grant multiple reputation points, the main mobs that can be farmed in the open world for this faction grant only 1 reputation point per kill. Even while this method is drastically slow and inefficient, it’s recommended to be done until the Honored reputation status as most mobs grant reputation until that status.

Besides the mobs in the open world, players can also farm mobs from the [Ruins of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/ruins-of-ahnqiraj-aq20/) raid to farm reputation, even after Honored. However, due to the raid lockout mechanic and the number of players that must be involved, the mobs from the raid will only act as a complementary way of farming the reputation besides grinding mobs in the Open World and completing quests.

Both the one-time and repeatable quests should ideally be completed after reaching Honored with the [Cenarion Circle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/609) but players may choose to mix the mob grinding and questing since the mob grinding process is extremely tedious. Most quests in Silithus grant reputation with the [Cenarion Circle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/609) faction but other zones also grant reputation!

In addition, one thing to remember is that the quests are split into two categories: quests available before the Gates of Ahn’Qiraj open and quests that become available after the gate opens. We will split the quests into separate categories to avoid confusing any players!

Whenever a player encounters the [Cenarion Circle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/609), their Reputation Status is set to Neutral.

**Reputation system** – **required reputation points per reputation status**

* Neutral (0/3000)
* Friendly (0/6000)
* Honored (0/12000)
* Revered (0/21000)
* Exalted

### Cenarion Circle Mob Grinding

There are two main mob types that you can kill to farm reputation for the [Cenarion Circle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/609): mobs from the [Ruins of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/ruins-of-ahnqiraj-aq20/) raid and members of the Twilight Hammer cult. The mobs from the [Ruins of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/ruins-of-ahnqiraj-aq20/) raid can be farmed until Exalted while the mobs that are part of the Twilight Hammer cult offered different reputation points that can only be farmed until specific reputation statuses depending on the mobs themselves.

Most mobs from the Twilight Hammer cult reward 1 x reputation points per kill while a few offer 5 x reputation points. As mentioned, most mobs can only be farmed until the Honored status, however, some of the rarer spawns give reputation until Revered.

#### Twilight Hammer Cult Mobs

| Mob | Reputation Gain | Farmable Reputation Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Twilight Flamereaver](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15201) | 1 Reputation | Farmable until Honored |
| [Twilight Avenger](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11880) | 1 Reputation | Farmable until Honored |
| [Twilight Geolord](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11881) | 1 Reputation | Farmable until Honored |
| [Twilight Overlord](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15213) | 1 Reputation | Farmable until Honored |
| [Twilight Master](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11883) | 1 Reputation | Farmable until Honored |
| [Twilight Stonecaller](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11882) | 1 Reputation | Farmable until Honored |
| [Twilight Marauder](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15542) | 1 Reputation | Farmable until Honored |
| [Twilight Marauder Morna](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15541) | 1 Reputation | Farmable until Honored |
| [Twilight Prophet](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15308) | 5 Reputation | Farmable until Revered |
| [Twilight Lord Everun](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/14479) | 5 Reputation | Farmable until Revered |
| [Twilight Keeper Mayna](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15200) | 1 Reputation | Farmable until Revered |
| [Twilight Keeper Exeter](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11803) | 1 Reputation | Farmable until Revered |
| [Twilight Keeper Havunth](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11804) | 1 Reputation | Farmable until Revered |
| [Vyral the Vile](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15202) | 1 Reputation | Farmable until Revered |

#### Ruins of Ahn’Qiraj Mobs

Most of the trash mobs in the [Ruins of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/ruins-of-ahnqiraj-aq20/) grant reputation for the [Cenarion Circle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/609). Keep in mind that all bosses will grant reputation as well, but they can’t be farmed efficiently due to the raid lockout mechanic, making the repeatable quests far more efficient. Nonetheless, players should incorporate a [Ruins of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/ruins-of-ahnqiraj-aq20/) run whenever they are not locked to speed up the process.

### Cenarion Circle One-Time Quests

#### Post Opening of the Ahn’Qiraj Gates (Silithus) One-Time Quests

After the Gates of Ahn’Qiraj open, new sets of quests unlock for all players! Those sets begin with the [Field Duty](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8507) and [Cenarion Battlegear](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8800) quests picked up from **Cenarion Hold**. Field Duty is a repeatable quest that can be used to access a plethora of other quests under different specific tags. The quests act as a fast way to gain reputation but they often require groups of people to complete.

The quests tied to [Field Duty](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8507) are tagged under the following terms: [Combat Assignment](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/20808), [Logistics Assignment](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/21132), and [Tactical Assignment](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20809). Each type of assignment offers different quests that can be endlessly completed to grind reputation and receive rewards.

[Cenarion Battlegear](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8800) also unlocks a list of repeatable quests tied to different reputation statuses: [Volunteer’s Battlegear](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8548), [Veteran’s Battlegear](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8572), [Stalwart’s Battlegear](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8574), [Champion’s Battlegear](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8573).

In addition, [Allegiance to Cenarion Circle](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/9338) also becomes available, providing players with a quick way to repeatedly increase their reputation.

#### Druid One-Time Quests

The Druid class has an easier time raising reputation with the [Cenarion Circle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/609) thanks to its class quests and direct tie to **Moonglade**.

### Cenarion Circle Repeatable Quests

A few repeatable quests can be completed to increase reputation with the [Cenarion Circle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/609)! Most of those quests can be unlocked via chain quests in Silithus, but one takes place in the [Temple of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/temple-of-ahnqiraj-aq40/) raid. The first and foremost repeatable quest players can complete is [Encrypted Twilight Texts](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8319). The other repeatable quests are locked behind chain quests and the [Temple of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/temple-of-ahnqiraj-aq40/) raid.

Season of Discovery Changes
---------------------------

Season of Discovery brings a few changes to the [Cenarion Circle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/609)! Most of the changes come in the form of more efficient reputation farming and new rewards that players can collect.

### Season of Discovery Reputation Farming

The major change for Season of Discovery is the ability to exchange [Alliance Commendation Signet](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/21436)s/[Horde Commendation Signet](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/21438)s for reputation with the [Cenarion Circle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/609)! Players will be able to do so by completing specific quests at **Cenarion Hold**. In addition, a new one-time quest has been added to Season of Discovery which yields a bit of reputation. While the one-time quest doesn’t compare to the commendation signets, every bit of increased reputation leads you faster to the Exalted status.

| Quest | Reputation Rewards |
| --- | --- |
| **Dust to Dust** | 100 Reputation |
| **One Commendation Signet** (Repeatable) | 5 Reputation |
| **Ten Commendation Signets** (Repeatable) | 75 Reputation |

### Season of Discovery Rewards

Most of the rewards available in the Season of Discovery are enhanced versions of the older items that could be obtained from the [Cenarion Circle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/609) in WoW Classic!
