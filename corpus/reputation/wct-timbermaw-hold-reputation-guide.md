The Timbermaw Tribe is one of the very few original Furbolg tribes remaining on Azeroth that kept their traditions and haven’t succumbed to the influence of the past Burning Legion invasions. The faction representing the tribe is called [Timbermaw Hold](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/576), and has footings inside different areas of the game such as **Felwood** and **Winterspring**! In WoW Classic, they are widely known for the infamous [Timbermaw Hold](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zone/1769) cave where they attack any adventurer trying to cross into **Moonglade** or **Winterspring**.

In the Season of Discovery, a few changes occurred to the [Timbermaw Hold](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/576) faction! The previous items they were offering to players received improved versions while entirely new items were also added into the mix. In addition, Phase 6 of the Season of Discovery also adds a new way of increasing reputation with the [Timbermaw Hold](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/576)!

Timbermaw Hold – Main Hub
-------------------------

The [Timbermaw Hold](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/576) faction’s main hub can be found in the infamous [Timbermaw Hold](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zone/1769) cave! There, [Meilosh](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11557), [Kernda](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11558), [Gorn One Eye](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11555), and other soon-to-be allied Furbolgs will eventually provide you with a cozy place to rest, quests, and valuable items.

[![timbermaw hold main hub](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Timbermaw-Hold-Main-Hub-1024x541.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Timbermaw-Hold-Main-Hub.jpg)

Timbermaw Hold – Main Hub

However, besides [Timbermaw Hold](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zone/1769), players will also encounter valuable NPCs such as [Salfa](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11556), [Grazle](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11554), and [Nafien](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15395) outside the main hub. [Salfa](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11556) and [Nafien](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15395) can be found just outside it while [Grazle](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11554) is at the beginning of the Felwood area, on the path next to the **Emerald Sanctuary**.

Timbermaw Hold Reputation Farming
---------------------------------

Encountering the Timbermaw Hold faction for the first time will set your Reputation Status with them to 2500 Hostile!

**Reputation System** – **Required Reputation Points per Reputation Status**

* Hated (0/36000)
* Hostile (0/3000)
* Unfriendly (0/3000)
* Neutral (0/3000)
* Friendly (0/6000)
* Honored (0/12000)
* Revered (0/21000)
* Exalted

Players can mainly farm reputation for the [Timbermaw Hold](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/576) faction in two ways: Killing Mobs and Completing Quests! Players can complete one-time and repeatable (daily) quests to raise their reputation. The mob grinding part mainly refers to killing Furbolg members of Timbermaw Tribe’s rival factions in **Winterspring** (Winterfall Tribe) and **Felwood** (Deadwood Tribe).

Both methods are very viable, however, players can only grind mobs efficiently until the Revered reputation! Past the Revered only some of the special members of the rival tribes will continue granting reputation per kill. Resorting to only killing those special members will eventually get you to Exalted but in an extremely inefficient way.

### Quests

Quests for increasing your reputation with the [Timbermaw Hold](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/576) are split into two distinct categories: One-Time and Repeatable. There are only a few one-time quests that you can complete, landing you a meager reputation. However, you can complete repeatable quests to speed up the reputation-farming process. Ideally, you will want to complete the repeatable quests after reaching the Revered Reputation Status, but you may choose to mix mob grinding and quest completion simultaneously.

#### Exalted Reputation Quest

Once players hit Exalted with the [Timbermaw Hold](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/576), the quest [The Root of All Evil](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8481) becomes available! This quest is challenging and requires multiple geared characters but yields a powerful reward! Players completing this quest gain the [Defender of the Timbermaw](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/21326) trinket!

Timbermaw Hold Rewards
----------------------

Almost all the rewards that can be acquired by farming reputation for the [Timbermaw Hold](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/576) faction are sold by [Meilosh](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11557)! He acts as the quartermaster for the faction and can be found inside the [Timbermaw Hold](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zone/1769) cave. Remember that the prices listed below are according to their respective reputation levels, but they change once you raise your reputation level. For example, the costs for Friendly items are reduced whenever you reach Honored, and reduced once more for every other reputation level, including Exalted.

Season of Discovery Changes – Timbermaw Hold
--------------------------------------------

Season of Discovery adds a few changes to the [Timbermaw Hold](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/576) faction, specifically, a new way of gaining reputation and some great overhauled rewards!

### New Reputation Farming Method

Phase 6 of the Season of Discovery allows players to increase their reputation with the [Timbermaw Hold](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/576) by using [Alliance Commendation Signet](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/21436)s/[Horde Commendation Signet](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/21438)s to buy special consumables that yield reputation during the [Ahn’Qiraj War Effort](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/ahnqiraj-war-effort-guide/) event!

The previous methods such as mob grinding and repeatable quests remain a valid option as well, but the new reputation farm speeds up the process massively.
