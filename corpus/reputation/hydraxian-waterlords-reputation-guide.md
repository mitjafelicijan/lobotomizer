The Hydraxian Waterlords are a faction of water elementals who are based off the coast of Azshara. They are led by Duke Hydraxis and are enemies of the Firelord, Ragnaros, and his followers. Reputation with this faction is required to access the final two bosses of the [Molten Core](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/mc/) raid. In Season of Discovery, this faction has also been expanded to offer some unique endgame rewards.

Players start at Friendly with the [Hydraxian Waterlords](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/749) faction. This guide will direct you how to gain reputation all the way to Exalted.

Who Needs Hydraxian Waterlords Rep?
-----------------------------------

Reputation with [Hydraxian Waterlords](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/749) is required to obtain either [Aqual Quintessence](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/17333) or [Eternal Quintessence](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/22754). These items are required to douse 7 different runes inside the [Molten Core](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/mc/) raid in order to access the final two bosses ([Majordomo Executus](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/molten-core/majordomo-executus) and [Ragnaros](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/molten-core/ragnaros)). Each raid group will therefore need 7 quintessence items available for this purpose, meaning 7 different raid members who each have one in their bags. It’s a good idea for every raider to carry one just in case.

[Aqual Quintessence](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/17333) can be obtained after reaching Honored and completing the quest [Hands of the Enemy](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6824). You can only carry one of these items and they can only be used one time, so you will have to keep returning to Azshara to pick them up. After reaching Revered, you’ll be able to get [Eternal Quintessence](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/22754), the permanent version of this same item.

In Season of Discovery, there are additional awards available through this faction, including the [Hydraxian Coronation](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/227926) cloak enchantment that gives 20 fire resistance as well as the epic trinket [Duke’s Domain](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/227915).

How to Get Hydraxian Waterlords Reputation
------------------------------------------

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Status** | **Additional Reputation**  **Required** |
| Friendly | 0 |
| Honored | 6000 |
| Revered | 12,000 |
| Exalted | 21,000 |

The best way to obtain reputation for [Hydraxian Waterlords](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/749) is by killing enemies. Beyond Revered, the only enemies that award reputation are inside the [Molten Core](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/mc/) raid.

The final quest in the chain offered by Duke Hydraxis, [A Hero’s Reward](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/7486), grants 200 reputation. The other quests in the chain do not award reputation, however, so questing is not a good method of farming rep.

In Season of Discovery, daily quests for the [Blackrock Eruption Event](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/blackrock-eruption-event-guide-for-season-of-discovery-sod/) award reputation with this faction and provide another way to farm reputation outside of the raid.

### Hydraxian Waterlord Reputation From Enemies

There are several enemies you can defeat to obtain Hydraxian Waterlord reputation. Most of them will only grant rep to a certain point, with only bosses in the [Molten Core](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/mc/) raid offering reputation past Revered.

#### Open World

There are a handful of level 55-58 elementals that you can kill in the open world to earn reputation. Most only offer **5 reputation each**, and they stop granting it at Honored. There is one rare elemental who grants 25 reputation up to Revered.

| Name | Zone | Reputation | Until |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Desert Rumbler](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11746) | Silithus | 5 | Honored |
| [Dust Stormer](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11744) | Silithus | 5 | Honored |
| [Greater Obsidian Elemental](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/7032) | Burning Steppes | 5 | Honored |
| [Huricanian](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/14478) | Silithus | 25 | Revered |

#### Dungeons

There are two dungeon enemies who award 15-20 reputation per kill up to Revered.

| Name | Dungeon | Reputation | Until |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Lord Incendius](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/blackrock-depths/lord-incendius) | [Blackrock Depths](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/blackrock-depths) | 15 | Revered |
| [Pyroguard Emberseer](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/upper-blackrock-spire/pyroguard-emberseer) | [Upper Blackrock Spire](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/upper-blackrock-spire) | 20 | Revered |

#### Molten Core Raid

Many trash mobs inside the Molten Core raid grant 20-40 reputation up to Revered, while bosses offer 100-200 reputation until Exalted. There is no reputation gained from defeating Majordomo Executus.

| Name | Reputation | Until |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ancient Core Hound | 20 | Revered |
| Firelord | 20 | Revered |
| Firewalker | 20 | Revered |
| Flameguard | 20 | Revered |
| Lava Elemental | 20 | Revered |
| Lava Reaver | 20 | Revered |
| Lava Surger | 20 | Revered |
| Molten Destroyer | 40 | Revered |
| Lucifron | 100 | Exalted |
| Magmadar | 100 | Exalted |
| Gehennas | 100 | Exalted |
| Garr | 100 | Exalted |
| Baron Geddon | 100 | Exalted |
| Shazzrah | 100 | Exalted |
| Sulfuron Harbinger | 100 | Exalted |
| Golemagg the Incinerator | 150 | Exalted |
| Ragnaros | 200 | Exalted |

### Hydraxian Waterlord Reputation From Blackrock Eruption Daily Quests

Season of Discovery has added several new daily quests for the [Blackrock Eruption Event](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/blackrock-eruption-event-guide-for-season-of-discovery-sod/), each of which offer 150-200 reputation with [Hydraxian Waterlords](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/749) when completed. All of these quests require a minimum level of 55 with the exception of **Work Smarter, Not Harder**, which requires level 57.

| Quest | Reputation |
| --- | --- |
| Firefighting | 150 |
| Grinding Them Down | 150 |
| Lava Diving | 150 |
| More Like Lame-bringers! | 200 |
| Priority Target: Duke Searbrand | 200 |
| Priority Target: Duke Tectonis | 200 |
| Sleepless Nights | 150 |
| Work Smarter, Not Harder | 150 |

### Hydraxian Waterlords Reputation From Quests

There are a few quests available from Duke Hydraxis, but most of them **do not award reputation** with the [Hydraxian Waterlords](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/749). Only the final quest, [A Hero’s Reward](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/7486)offers reputation as a reward. You will only be granted a humble 200 reputation with the faction for completing this quest, so completing these quests will not get you very far. There are other reasons to complete them, however – primarily to obtain [Aqual Quintessence](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/17333) and later [Eternal Quintessence](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/22754), which are needed in [Molten Core](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/mc/).

The quests can be started from **Duke Hydraxis** in Azshara. Here they are in order:

1. [Stormers and Rumblers](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6805) + [Poisoned Water](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6804)
   * These quests are completed in the Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands zones, respectively.
2. [Eye of the Emberseer](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6821)
   * This quest is completed in the [Upper Blackrock Spire](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/upper-blackrock-spire) dungeon.
3. [The Molten Core](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6822)
   * This quest is completed inside the [Molten Core](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/mc/) raid.
4. [Agent of Hydraxis](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6823)
   * This quest requires reaching Honored with [Hydraxian Waterlords](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/749).
5. [Hands of the Enemy](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6824)
   * This quest is completed inside the [Molten Core](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/mc/) raid.
6. [A Hero’s Reward](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/7486)
   * This quest requires completing all of the previous quests.

Duke Hydraxis Location
----------------------

Duke Hydraxis can be found on a remote island in the Bay of Storms in Azshara (79.2, 73.6). This location can be tricky to reach: it’s far from any flight masters or innkeepers, and it requires crossing the very uneven landscape of Azshara followed by open water to reach the island.

Hydraxian Waterlords Reputation Rewards

Earning reputation with the [Hydraxian Waterlords](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/749) is required to obtain the two Quintessence items that are needed to summon bosses in the Molten Core raid.
