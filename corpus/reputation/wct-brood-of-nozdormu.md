Brood of Nozdormu – Faction Encounter & Hub
-------------------------------------------

[Brood of Nozdormu](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/910) is directly tied to the [Scepter of the Shifting Sands questline](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/scepter-of-the-shifting-sands-questline/) and encountered during its progression! The main hub of the [Brood of Nozdormu](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/910) is the **Caverns of Time**, however, even if you physically visit it, you won’t officially add the faction to your Reputation Tab until you begin the questline and complete [What Tomorrow Brings](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8286). The quest can be picked up from [Baristolth of the Shifting Sands](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15180) from **Cenarion Hold** in **Silithus**.

Baristolth of the Shifting Sands – What Tomorrow Brings Questgiver

The [What Tomorrow Brings](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8286) quest directly sends you to discover the [Brood of Nozdorm](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/910) faction, adding it to your Reputation Tab after you encounter [Anachronos](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15192) and return the quest to [Baristolth of the Shifting Sands](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15180). Upon encountering [Anachronos](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15192) at the **Caverns of Time**, your reputation with the [Brood of Nozdormu](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/910) is set to Hated, marking the beginning of a long and complicated journey!

Brood of Nozdormu – Reputation Farming
--------------------------------------

Now that you met the [Brood of Nozdormu](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/910), you’ll most likely wonder how to increase your Reputation with them. The best way to improve your reputation with the faction is to follow the [Scepter of the Shifting Sands questline](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/scepter-of-the-shifting-sands-questline/) and farm the [Ruins of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/ruins-of-ahnqiraj-aq20/) and [Temple of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/temple-of-ahnqiraj-aq40/) raids. The [Temple of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/temple-of-ahnqiraj-aq40/) is the main way of farming reputation with the [Brood of Nozdormu](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/910), but bosses in the [Ruins of Ahn’Qira](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/ruins-of-ahnqiraj-aq20/)j also yield a small amount of reputation.

**Reputation System** – **Required Reputation Points per Reputation Status**

* Hated (0/36000)
* Hostile (0/3000)
* Unfriendly (0/3000)
* Neutral (0/3000)
* Friendly (0/6000)
* Honored (0/12000)
* Revered (0/21000)
* Exalted

The [Scepter of the Shifting Sands questline](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/scepter-of-the-shifting-sands-questline/) is long and comprises 32 quests, giving Reputation for the [Brood of Nozdormu](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/910). The first part of the questline is where most of the reputation is farmed! This part is infamous as it involves killing an insane number of insects in **Silithus** to acquire [Silithid Carapace Fragment](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/20384)s for the repeatable [The Hand of the Righteous](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8302) quest. If the gates of Ahn’Qiraj haven’t opened yet, repeatedly completing [The Hand of the Righteous](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8302) will be the only way to raise your reputation with the [Brood of Nozdormu](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/910) to Neutral. You will also be able to gain reputation beyond Neutral by continuing the questline with the [Anachronos](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8303) quest but you won’t be able to farm [The Hand of the Righteous](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8302) anymore.

Almost every quest of the [Scepter of the Shifting Sands questline](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/scepter-of-the-shifting-sands-questline/) will grant reputation with the [Brood of Nozdormu](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/910)! Ideally, you will want to remain at Neutral status and preserve the questline for when the gates are open and the [Temple of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/temple-of-ahnqiraj-aq40/) becomes available to reach the Exalted status as fast as possible without waiting for several raid resets.

Reputation with the [Brood of Nozdormu](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/910) can also be gained during the Opening of the Gates of Ahn’Qiraj Event by killing elite mobs that spawn only during the event! Those mobs are extremely hard to kill and generally require a group of players to take down. Each mob grants a different reputation value upon being slayed.

**Elite Mobs that yield Brood of Nozdormu reputation during the Gates of Ahn’Qiraj Event:** (Click on links to see the exact spawn locations)

Alternatively, if you don’t wish to pursue the questline and the gates have already been opened, players can simply farm reputation inside the [Temple of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/temple-of-ahnqiraj-aq40/) raid. Each mob increases grants 100 Reputation with the [Brood of Nozdormu](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/910) while each boss gives a different value. After gaining Friendly with the faction, players can only gain reputation by killing [Emperor Vek’nilash](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15275), [Emperor Vek’lor](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15276), and [C’thun](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15727).

**Ruins of Ahn’Qiraj & Temple of Ahn’Qiraj Brood of Nozdormu Reputation per kill**:

Besides the reputation gained by killing mobs and bosses in the [Temple of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/temple-of-ahnqiraj-aq40/) raid, players will also be able to increase their reputation with [Ancient Qiraji Artifact](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/21230)s and [Qiraji Lord’s Insignia](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/21229)s. All mobs in the [Temple of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/temple-of-ahnqiraj-aq40/) can drop [Ancient Qiraji Artifact](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/21230)s but the item has a very low drop chance, with the Qiraji Lasher having the highest drop chance at 33%. In contrast, only bosses can drop [Qiraji Lord’s Insignia](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/21229)s and almost every boss guarantees a drop. The only bosses that don’t have a 100% drop chance are [Ouro](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15517) and [Princess Huhuran](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15509).

[Ancient Qiraji Artifact](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/21230)s can be turned in through the [Secrets of the Qiraji](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8784) quest to [Andorgos](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15502) for 1000[Brood of Nozdormu](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/910) reputation while [Qiraji Lord’s Insignia](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/21229)s can be turned in through the [Mortal Champions](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8579) quest to [Kandrostrasz](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15503) for 500 [Brood of Nozdormu](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/910) reputation and 100 [Cenarion Circle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/faction/609) reputation.
