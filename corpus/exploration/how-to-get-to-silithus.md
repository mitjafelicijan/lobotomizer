Silithus is a max level zone to the West of Un’Goro Crater that is home to the insectoid elder race, the Silithid. Outside of Moonglade, it is the main outpost of the Cenarion Circle and the location where the world event The Ahn’Qiraj War Effort, that begins Phase 5. Once Phase 5 has started, the two dungeons; [Ruins of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-ruins-of-ahnqiraj-aq20-guide/) and [Temple of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-temple-of-ahnqiraj-aq40-guide/), will open as well, being available to players.

There are only a handful of ways to reach the zone, but, other than exploration, there are only two reasons why you’d want to. The first is for the obvious Phase 5 event to help the Cenarion Circle in their battle against C’Thun. The second and, more likely for Hunters, Paladins, Rogues and Warriors reading this before Phase 5 starts, is for the completion of the quest chain which culminates in the acquisition of Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker.

In either case, any of these travel options will work, though one might be slightly more difficult.

**Option 1: By Way of Marshal’s Refuge**
----------------------------------------

[![Classic How To Get To Silithus Guide Images Marshals Refuge](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-Marshals-Refuge-1024x575.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-Marshals-Refuge.jpg)

If you’re heading to Silithus, chances are you already have the flight path to Marshal’s Refuge. If you don’t, you might just want to skip down to Option 2 now. Then again, you might also want to get the flight path now, while you’re in the area. From the refuge head in a roughly Southwesterly direction favoring Westerly. The main river in Un’Goro ends in a little lake that makes the whole river look almost like a Cobra on the map. Go to the mouth of that Cobra and right where it’s tongue tip, and the river, end completely, head straight Northwest.

[![Classic How To Get To Silithus Guide Images Ungoro Map](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-UnGoro-Map-1024x691.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-UnGoro-Map.jpg)

If you look at the big circle that is Un’Goro Crater like a clock, with Marshal’s Refuge at 12 and the entrance to Un’Goro from Tanaris at 3, then you’re looking to head to almost exactly between 10 and 11 on the clock. When you get close you’ll see some oddly shaped natural pillars that mark the entrance to Silithus.

**Option 2: Coming from Tanaris**
---------------------------------

[![Classic How To Get To Silithus Guide Images Thistleshrub Valley](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-Thistleshrub-Valley.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-Thistleshrub-Valley.jpg)

Even if you don’t have the Marshal’s Refuge flight path, you’ll definitely have the one for Gadgetzan. If you don’t then start by doing that first, not just to make this easier, but also because having all of the Steamwheedle Cartel flight paths is like having all of the railroads in Monopoly – you kind of need them to succeed.

[![Classic How To Get To Silithus Guide Images Gadgetzan](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-Gadgetzan-1024x808.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-Gadgetzan.jpg)

From Gadgetzan, head Southwest, with a more Southerly than Westerly slant. You’re going to want to keep the Abyssal Sands to the East on your left as you go. You’ll also pass by a large creepy bug area with giant insect appendages sticking out of the ground to the West on your right. Those are the Silithid, whose home you are going to now, hopefully to set fire to. Keep going South until you see a couple of strange, alien looking pillars.

There will also be a line of little dots on your map that mark the path into Un’Goro.

[![Classic How To Get To Silithus Guide Images Tanaris Map](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-Tanaris-Map-1024x859.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-Tanaris-Map.jpg)

Take the path into Un’Goro and then head straight towards the river and follow it vaguely Northwest. Watch out for the Devilsaur!

[![Classic How To Get To Silithus Guide Images Devilsaur](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-Devilsaur.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-Devilsaur.jpg)

When you reach the end of the river, follow the directions from Option 1 and head straight Northwest from the Cobra’s Tongue to find the natural pillars. Once you find them, you’ll have found the entrance to Silithus!

**Option 3: Swimming from Feralas, also Suicide!**
--------------------------------------------------

[![Classic How To Get To Silithus Guide Images The Forgotten Coast](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-The-Forgotten-Coast.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-The-Forgotten-Coast.jpg)

This option is…probably not even necessary, but might be easier for lower level characters, though non-Druids will have a slow going. First, make sure to take off all of your gear and store it, because you are definitely going to die at least once, and you don’t want to incur the repair cost. Start anywhere in Feralas and head straight to the Forgotten Coast to the West. If you are an Alliance player and are starting at Feathermoon Stronghold, you will have to take the Feathermoon Ferry East to the coast. If you’re Horde, you’ll likely start in Camp Mojache’ and will want to head straight West on the main road until you hit the ocean.

[![Classic How To Get To Silithus Guide Images Feralas Map 2](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-Feralas-Map-2-1024x779.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-Feralas-Map-2.jpg)

Once at the shoreline, follow it straight south until you can’t then swim the rest of the way until you cross into the Silithus zone. To ensure that you definitely end up in Silithus, and to find a cool hidden area, continue to head South until you find a secret abandoned Tauren Village!

![Classic How To Get To Silithus Guide Images Hidden Tauren Village](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Classic-How-To-Get-To-Silithus-Guide-Images-Hidden-Tauren-Village-1024x523.jpg)

Cool, right? I call it Camp Qirache. Ok, now that you’ve reached this cool new place…go ahead out into the water and drown yourself. I know it sounds messed up, but when you release your spirit to the Spirit Healer, you’ll be AT Cenarion Hold and the flight path for Silithus. Congratulations, you made it!

Now you know how to get to Silithus. Whether you’re gearing up for Phase 5, trying to get that awesome sword, or just doing a little exploring – you now know what you need to get where you’re going. Once in Silithus, follow the rough road until you reach one Cenarion Hold. It’s a Night Elf style settlement and one of the only built structures in the zone, so you can’t miss it. Be sure to pick up the flight path there, because, like Un’goro and Tanaris before, it’s the only one in the entire zone.

Have fun, and remember, fire IS the cleanser! Seriously folks, those giant wasp mountain hives are terrifying. Burn them.
