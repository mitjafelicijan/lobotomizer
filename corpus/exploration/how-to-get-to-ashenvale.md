[Ashenvale](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/331) is a significant zone in WoW Classic, marking the front line of the conflict between the Alliance and the Horde. The zone is where night elf territory abuts the outskirts of Orgrimmar, and both factions have a significant number of quests in the zone. The [Blackfathom Deeps](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/blackfathom-deeps/) dungeon can also be found on the western coast.

How you get to the zone will depend upon which faction you’re playing. Ashenvale is a contested zone that borders both Alliance and Horde controlled territories as well as some higher-level zones.

Getting to Ashenvale as Alliance
--------------------------------

The Alliance route to Ashenvale is pretty convoluted compared to the Horde’s. The most complicated route is from Stormwind, which is pretty inconvenient since that’s the faction’s capital city.

*Alliance routes to Ashenvale*

If you’re starting from **Stormwind**, you’ll have to start by taking the Deeprun Tram to Ironforge. The tram can be found in the Dwarven District. Enter the station and wait for a train to arrive. Board it and you’ll have about a one-minute ride to the other station at Ironforge, where you can hop off and follow the route from there.

*The Deeprun Tram in Stormwind*

Starting from **Ironforge**, leave the city through the front gate and head down the hill, then east. You’ll pass through the gate into Loch Modan, and then head north into the Wetlands. Continue following the road as it loops around to the west and you’ll reach Menethil Harbor. Wait on the northernmost dock for a boat to arrive. Board it, and it will take you to Auberdine in Darkshore. From there you can follow the road south into Ashenvale.

If you’re starting in **Darnassus**, you’ll first have to use the portal on the western island of the Temple Gardens to go down to Rut’theran Village at the bottom of Teldrassil. From there you can head out to the dock and wait for the boat to take you across to Auberdine in Darkshore. Follow the road south from Auberdine to reach Ashenvale.

Getting to Ashenvale as Horde
-----------------------------

*Horde routes to Ashenvale*

Horde have a more straightforward route to Ashenvale than Alliance. Unless you’re coming from Undercity, you only need to follow the road. There’s also a shortcut from Orgrimmar if you exit the side entrance.

If you’re starting from **Undercity**, you’ll have to take a zeppelin to Orgrimmar before you can start the journey. The zeppelin tower is located to the north of the city in Tirisfal Glades, at the top of the hill where the road forks. Climb the tower and wait for the zeppelin to arrive at the dock. The dock you want is the slightly lower one – the top one goes to Stranglethorn Vale. Once the zeppelin arrives outside Orgrimmar, you can follow the path from there.

If you’re starting from **Orgrimmar**, you’ll leave through the side gate and head north along the river. Eventually you’ll be able to climb up the hill into Ashenvale.

Starting out from **Thunder Bluff**, head down elevator from the mesa and cross Mulgore into The Barrens. Turn north at Camp Taurajo and follow the path all the way up to Ashenvale.

Getting to Blackfathom Deeps or Zoram’gar Outpost will require skirting around Astranaar, the Alliance town in the center of Ashenvale. Just be careful not to follow the road through here.
