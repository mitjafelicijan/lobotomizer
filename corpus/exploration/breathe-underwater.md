There are a surprising number of reasons to be underwater in WoW Classic, whether you’re questing, farming, or fighting enemies in [Blackfathom Deeps](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/blackfathom-deeps). This guide will help you take advantage of all the best tools, consumables, and abilities at your disposal so you can stay underwater longer without fear of having to make a long run back from the nearest graveyard.

Abilities
---------

The easiest way to breathe underwater is with your character’s own abilities! Shamans will need to carry around a reagent for this while Druids have the added advantage of a faster swim speed.

#### Passion

I love MMOs of all shades, especially the nitty gritty numbers parts of them. You might recognize me from the Shadow Priest discord, otherwise I play a little bit of everything, especially games with support roles available.
