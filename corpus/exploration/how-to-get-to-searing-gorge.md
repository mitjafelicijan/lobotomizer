Searing Gorge is a medium to high level zone located almost at the center of the Eastern Kingdoms and nestled between the dwarven starting land of Dun Morogh and The Burning Steppes. As its name might suggest, the entire zone is a charred, burning hellscape, within a deep foreboding valley. Aside from the outcast Dark Iron settlement of Thorium Point, there are few other friendly settlements in the zone, to either faction.

Like the Burning Steppes, Searing Gorge is almost completely dominated by the Dark Iron Clan. The zone is populated by many Dark Iron Dwarf and Blackrock Orc NPCs and mobs, but also home to a variety of other creatures, including Fire Elementals, Spiders, Constructs, Fire Beetles, at least one demon and a dragonkin.

Many players will have many reasons for visiting Searing Gorge, but the most obvious reason most players do is that it contains one of the entrances to Blackrock Mountain. Within the mountain are the entrances to over four different dungeons, including some of Classic WoW’s premium endgame content.

Any players wishing to enter into Searing Gorge have but two possible approaches…

Method One: Just walk in from the Badlands
------------------------------------------

This is just about as simple as it can get. Find the entrance to Searing Gorge on the Western border of the Badlands. Horde players will have an easier time with this, needing only to head south from Kargath to about the middle of the map and then head West through a pass.

It also isn’t at all that hard for Alliance players to enter the Badlands from Loch Modan and follow the very rough road to the Southwest to find the same pass.

Method Two: Through Blackrock Mountain
--------------------------------------

This one is a little easier for Alliance players, as the entrance to the Burning Steppes from the south is through the Redridge Mountains. Just head north into the Burning Steppes from Redridge and then follow the road a little north and then more fully to the west. If you are under level 50, you’re going to want to MOVE, because everything here will kill you.

Once you can see Blackrock Mountain, you know where you’re headed. Keep going west until you find the turn off that leads to the mountain. Follow that road, straight North and through the mountain, until you reach the gate on the other side. Once there, you’re done. Just head to Thorium Point in the East to get the flight path.

Method Three: The Key to Searing Gorge (Alliance Only)
------------------------------------------------------

So this one is only kind of cool, because you have to have already done either mthod one or two to be able to get this option. To open the gate to Searing Gorge, you have to go there first and find a Stegadon named Margol the Rager, who patrols a wide area in the Southeast of the zone.

Margol will drop Margol’s Horn, which starts a level 48 quest called The Horn of the Beast, which is the beginning of a short chain that leads to the guard at the gate to Searing Gorge in Lock Modan, then to Ironforge and back again. Once you’ve completed the whole chain, Mountaineer Pebblebitty will reward you with the key to the gate to Searing Gorge. Boom – you’re done.

This method is largely unnecessary, as getting to Searing Gorge is required to complete it, though before the addition of Thorium Point having access to the gate made travel MUCH easier for Alliance players.

That’s it! You now know all of the ways to gain access to Searing Gorge. I hope that I’ve helped some folks out there find their way. Thanks for reading and have a wonderful day!
