Within World of Warcraft Classic, there are several different character types you can choose from. These are known as classes, and each class comes with unique abilities, attacks, and spells they can use on their adventures. Some classes can fulfill the same role within the game, but each class will offer a unique and different game play experience. Whether you want to cast fireballs from afar or silently dispatch your foes from the shadows, there’s a choice for you!

### Class Roles

Each class is designed with a specific purpose. Some classes are capable of fulfilling multiple roles, but generally tend to excel at only one of them.

The main roles a class can fulfill are:

* **Damage (DPS)** – Damage dealers are responsible for using abilities and attacks to eliminate an enemy’s health points. Depending on which class is played, they can either attack enemies up close in melee range, or from a distance with spells or ranged attacks.
* **Tank** – Tanks are beefy meat shields with large health pools and strong defense or avoidance. They protect their allies by forcing enemies to attack them and absorbing hits from enemies. Tanks are excellent at staying alive and are defensive experts.
* **Healer** – Healers are responsible for supporting a group and ensuring they stay alive. They use spells to restore the health of allies, but are often quite vulnerable themselves. Healers work best in a group setting, allowing others to deal damage while they keep them alive.

### Training and Spell Ranks

Each time you level up is a time for celebration, but it’s also an indicator that you can learn new spells and gain more power. In World of Warcraft Classic, you’ll gain the ability to train with a class trainer every 2 levels that you gain, beginning at level 2.

Many spells and abilities in the game have multiple ranks associated with them. As you increase in level, you can train in higher ranks of spells you already have, which will allow them to do more damage. This often comes with an increased mana cost, which means it may be more efficient overall to use a lower rank in certain scenarios.

Each class has a specific set of trainers that they must visit in order to learn new abilities. Druids can only train with druid trainers, mages can only train with mage trainers, and so on. Trainers are often found within major cities for each faction, and also offer the ability to reset a character’s talents for a fee.

### Talents

Once a character reaches level 10, they will unlock a set of abilities known as talents. Talents are special bonuses that offer either new spells, benefits to existing abilities, or straight stat increases.

Talents allow for a lot of flexibility and customization for your character. Depending upon which talents you choose, the role your character fulfills can change. Certain talent choices are definitely more beneficial for particular roles, so carefully read the options you have available! You can test these in advance using our [WoW Classic talent calculator](/talent-calculator/).

You’ll gain a new talent point for every level you earn, meaning you’ll finish with 51 at max level. Each talent tree requires 31 points to reach the final talent, which is often the most useful and powerful of them all. This allows for an additional 20 to dip into another tree or add even further talents in one specialization.

In the even you decide you want to try another setup, you can always reset your talents at your class trainer. It starts at just a 1g fee, but steeply increases as you continue to reset them.
