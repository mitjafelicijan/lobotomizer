As someone who came back to private servers after a long stint on retail, I had difficulty understanding what people were actually talking about in player chat. I tried to find explanations (or even translations) online but didnâ€™t have much luck. I asked on the forums here for some contributions and we ended up with a collection of explanations for common terms, acronyms and abbreviations expected to exist in Classic. We hope you find this useful ðŸ™‚

#### **Raiding terminology**

![WoW Classic Raid Icon](/images/tatticons/raid.png)

Hard Res â€“ An item that has been reserved before a raid / dungeon that no other player is aloud to reserve or roll on. When putting together a dungeon or raid PuG, you should declare all hard reserved items in your LFG posts.  
Soft Res â€“ Any item that has not been hard reserved can be soft reserved by any amount of players. Players typically can only have 1 soft res per raid / dungeon and it must be declared before or at the start of the dungeon. If a soft reserved item drops, all players who reserved it will roll for it. If only 1 person soft reserved an item, they will automatically get it.  
DKP â€“ Dragon Kill Points. An alternative system for loot distribution that varies from guild to guild.  
GDKP â€“ Gold DKP; a loot system employed mostly in PUGS, but sometimes in guild groups, in which the item recipient is determined by gold bidding., explained [here](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=1090&p=4889#p4889) and from [first-hand experience here](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&p=6005#p6005).  
+1 reset â€“ In this loot distribution system the +1 refers to having received an item before. Once a member receives a +1 they are ineligible to roll. Explained [here](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=1090&p=4889#p4889).  
  
Table â€“ a phrase often used to request water and food from a mage. Origin is in retail where mages gained the ability to prepare banquet tables.

#### **Points of contention and discussion**

a tourist (n) â€“ A player who will only participate in Classic during the â€˜initial hypeâ€™ and then leave shortly afterwards.  
blizzlike (adj) â€“ An unofficial emulation of the game in question that seeks to be as accurate to retail  
as possible.  
loot trading (v) â€“ The ability to trade soulbound items with another player from your group after rolls have been conducted. Only in raids.  
sharding (n) â€“ System by which players are â€˜instancedâ€™ into smaller, separate virtual worlds to split large populations of similar level and thus reduce competition for resources. Regarded as a controversial change to the original game.  
If you want to contribute to the glossary please leave a reply below. We have omitted obvious ones like â€˜LFGâ€™ etc. and want submissions that are specifically Classic or Vanilla related.
