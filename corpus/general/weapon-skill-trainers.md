One unique feature of Classic WoW that doesn’t appear in later versions of the game is weapon skills. Every type of weapon in the game has its own associated skill to be learned and leveled. The weapon skills you can learn are based on your class, with some being known by default when you create your character and others needing to be learned from a Weapon Master.

This guide will cover locations for all of the Weapon Masters in the game along with which weapon skills they teach. But first, a few notes about specific weapon skills:

* All weapon skills can be learned at level 1 for a cost of 10 silver except for [Polearms](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/200). Polearms require level 20 and can be learned for 1 gold.
* [Wands](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5009) are a default weapon skill for Mages, Priests, and Warlocks. They are not taught by any Weapon Masters and can’t be learned by any other classes.
* The [Defense](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/204) and [Unarmed](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/203) skills also appear under Weapon Skills in the character window. All characters have these skills by default and they do not have their own trainers.
