Welcome to our WoW Classic guide for the mystical Darkmoon Faire! The Darkmoon Faire lasts for just a week and pops up once a month starting on the *first Monday of the month*. The entry location alternates between Elwynn Forest near Goldshire and Mulgore near Thunder Bluff. The faire offers players some excellent rewards if you are willing to put in the effort. It is also home to some fun mini games, giving you a nice break from the usual grind.

Much of the faire revolves around the acquisition of tickets. These can be acquired by handing in various trade goods. With enough tickets, you can exchange them for prizes like a bag ([Darkmoon Storage Box](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/19291)) and greens via a [Greater Darkmoon Prize](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=19296#contains:0-13+1).

Another major component of the faire is the card decks. There are 8 cards that can be collected as drops from various mobs around Azeroth and an ace card dropped from a dungeon boss. When you collect a full set, it can be exchanged for a powerful trinket at the Darkmoon Faire.

You can only receive prizes and hand in card decks when the faire is active, so it’s good to be prepared beforehand and know the requirements before it pops up. This guide will cover what you can do at the Darkmoon Faire, what you need to earn tickets, and what rewards you can earn from them. Let’s get started so you can enjoy the faire to its fullest when it is finally released!

How to Reach the Darkmoon Faire
-------------------------------

The Darkmoon Faire will always be located at one of two areas. This is either near Goldshire in Elwynn Forest, or next to Thunder Bluff in Mulgore. While both locations are more convenient for a specific faction, there *are not* any guards in the area to prevent you from entering the faire. The only thing to keep in mind about this is that you will be flagged for PvP if you are on a PvP server and visiting the opposing zone.

The easiest way to reach the *Mulgore location as an alliance player* is by taking the boat from Booty Bay to Ratchet. You’ll then need to run west across The Barrens to enter Mulgore. The easiest way to reach the *Elwynn Forest location as a horde player* is by taking the zeppelin to Grom’Gol Base Camp. From there, you’ll need to run north through Stranglethorn Vale *and* Duskwood to reach Elwynn Forest.

How to Earn Tickets
-------------------

Earning [Darkmoon Faire Prize Tickets](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/19182) is fairly straightforward. You’ll need to acquire a set number of various items dropped by monsters and crafted through professions. There are multiple levels of hand-ins for tickets, with more tickets rewarded for better turn-in items. There are 5 of these various tier levels, but only the highest tier of item hand-ins (and hardest to obtain) can be endlessly repeated.

The other 4 lower tiers are limited as far as how many item sets you can actually turn in during that month. Each set of items you turn in will give you 250 reputation with the Darkmoon Faire regardless of what tier it is from. Here are the cut-offs for each tier of hand-ins and how many is rewarded from each:

* T1: **1 Ticket** per hand-in, *stops at 401 reputation*
* T2: **4 Tickets** per hand-in, *stops at 1100 reputation*
* T3: **8 Tickets** per hand-in, *stops at 1625 reputation*
* T4: **12 Tickets** per hand-in, *stops at 2500 reputation*
* T5: **20 Tickets** per hand-in, *unlimited*

As you can likely imagine, it is most efficient to save all your hand-ins for the highest tier possible so you receive the most amount of tickets. Each hand-in will give 250 reputation, so handing in 10 sets of tier 4 items will give you the most tickets possible (ignoring tier 5 hand-ins).

Now that you know how the system works, you’ll also want to know what items you can actually turn in. There are three profession-based item sets you can use that relate to blacksmithing, engineering, and leatherworking. In addition, there are five item sets you can turn in that are dropped from specific beasts in Azeroth.

These fortunes come with a powerful [World Buff](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/world-buffs/), the effects of which are dependent upon the answers you give to each question. You’ll also receive a written fortune, which serves no purpose other than to be amusing or interesting, and you have a chance of getting a quest, **Your Fortune Awaits You…**, that awards some treasure.

Here are the order of responses you should choose for each buff:

* [Sayge’s Dark Fortune of Damage](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/23768): 1, 1

Card Decks and Trinkets
-----------------------

The other reward system of the Darkmoon Faire includes card decks. There are 4 different deck types in the game, each of which contains 8 cards dropped from specific enemies and an ace that drops from a dungeon boss. You will need all 9 cards to fully form a deck, which can then be exchanged for a specific epic trinket.

The 4 decks include the beasts set, elementals set, portals set, and warlords set. *All of the cards* for each deck is tradeable, meaning that you technically can purchase these bind-on-pickup trinkets by purchasing the necessary cards. You can be sure that they will be expensive, though.

Here is information for the *beasts* set:

* **2-8 cards**: drop from humanoids and undead creatures between level 45 and 60.
* **Ace**: drops from The Beast in Upper Blackrock Spire.
* **Trinket Reward**: [Darkmoon Card: Blue Dragon](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/19288), gives a 2% chance on spell casts to grant 100% mana regeneration for 15 seconds.

* **2-8 cards**: drop from humanoids and undead creatures between level 45 and 60.
* **Ace**: drops from any of the following 4 elite elementals: Avalanchion (Azshara), Hydrospawn (Dire Maul), Lord Incendius (Blackrocks Depths), and The Windreaver (Silithus).
* **Trinket Reward**: [Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/19289), gives a chance to hit your target with 200-300 nature damage (melee attacks only).

Here is information for the *portals* set:

* **2-8 cards**: drop from humanoids and undead creatures between level 45 and 60.
* **Ace**: drops from Darkmaster Gandling in Scholomance.
* **Trinket Reward**: [Darkmoon Card: Twisting Nether](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/19290), gives a 10% chance to revive upon death with 20 health/mana.
