Hallow’s End is one of the most popular holiday events within the game of World of Warcraft – both in the retail version and in WoW Classic.  It’s patterned heavily after the real world celebration of All Hallow’s Eve, or Halloween as it is known by here on Earth.

The holiday of Hallow’s End is the celebration of the Forsaken’s escape from the slavery of the Lich King and is very important to that them.  It’s also a time of mischievous pranks for all of the other races of Azeroth, particularly Humans and Orcs, who never seem to miss the opportunity to cause each other a bit of grief.

The event takes place over the last weeks of October, to coincide with Halloween.  This is usually estimated to have it run between October 18th and November 1st.  The more modern version of the event has a few more tricks and treats, Classic Hallow’s End still has plenty of spooky fun to offer players of all ages.

Hallow’s End Festivities
------------------------

During Hallow’s End, there are a lot of really fun games, treats, tricks and goings on to take part in.  While most of the rewards are either cosmetic, or practical, like food, some of them are extremely useful, even to higher level characters.

**Trick or Treating**

[![Classic Wow Hallow's End Guide Images Trick Or Treat](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-WoW-Hallows-End-Guide-Images-Trick-or-Treat.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-WoW-Hallows-End-Guide-Images-Trick-or-Treat.jpg)

What’s a fall celebration without some spooking and scaring, right?  During Hallow’s End, if you go to any of the inns in Azeroth, and interact with an innkeeper, they’ll have an option to “trick or treat”.  If you select it, you’ll either be tricked, or treated.  You’ll also get the debuff of the [same name](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/24755) and won’t be able to trick or treat again for another hour.

If you get **tricked**, one of two things will happen:

* You’ll either get transformed into a critter of some kind, a frog, snake, kitten, human ghost, skeleton or Mini-Diablo, for a short time. The big trick here is that you can’t simply dismiss this effect with a click, and will have to remain transformed for its duration!

-OR-

* You’ll be donned with a random Hallowed Wand costume for one hour. The costume will be one of the following;  a bat, Wisp, Leper Gnome, Pirate, Assassin, or Skeleton. These costumes *can* be dismissed, and interfere with spellcasting.

[![Classic Wow Hallow's End Guide Images Skeleton Costume](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-WoW-Hallows-End-Guide-Images-Skeleton-Costume.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-WoW-Hallows-End-Guide-Images-Skeleton-Costume.jpg)

If you get a **treat**, you’ll receive a [Treat Bag](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20393) containing on of the following:

* Hallow’s End Candy – [Candy Bar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20390), [Candy Corn](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20389), or [Lollipop](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20388). These are useful at any level, as they do a percentage of your health and mana, rather than a fixed amount.
* Flimsy Hallow’s End Mask – Just a head slot item that covers your face and makes you look vaguely like one of the many playable races in the game. They offer no bonuses of any kind.
* A Hallowed Wand – These wands allow you to use the same costumes that the innkeepers tricks sometimes bestowed, only now *you’re* the one doing the tricking! You can use these wands to randomly put a Hallowed Wand Costume onto yourself, *or* your friends!

**Bobbing for Apples**

A time honored, if strange tradition, bobbing for apples is non-the-less a fun way to get a free treat.  If you bob for apples at one of the many [Apple Bob](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/300203)s scattered throughout Azeroth, you’ll receive 5 [Bobbing Apples](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20516).  These fun, Hallow’s End treats offer any level healing, along with a buff to Stamina and Spirit, which also scales with level.

**Pumpkin Bag**

Probably the most useful physical reward to higher level characters, the [Pumpkin Bag](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20400) is a 16 slot bag that is a world drop from any creature of level 50 or above during Hallows End.  Getting it involves simply killing level 50+ mobs until it drops.

**Candy Vendors**

Hey!  You’re an adult.  You don’t have to trick or treat to get candy.  You can just buy it.  If they have the money, Alliance players should look for [Katrina Shimmerstar](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15353), in Ironforge, and Horde players should seek out [Rachelle Gothena](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15354) in Orgrimmar to get their hands on some unique, limited time treats.

Rachelle





Both vendor’s sell:

* [Bellara’s Nutterbar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/18635)
* [Moonbrook Riot Taffy](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/18632)
* [Styleen’s Sour Suckerpop](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/18633)
* [Tigule and Foror’s Strawberry Ice Cream](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7228) (A favorite with orphans during Children’s Week as well, but this is about YOU.)

After you have completed the Hallow’s End Treats questline and given a bunch of candy away to orphans, these vendors will also sell [Hallow’s End Pumpkin Treat](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20557) to you.

Hallow’s End Quests
-------------------

Aside from all of the fun and festivites, there are a number of great quests to pick up and do and all of the quests during Hallow’s End offer both experience and reputation with your faction’s main cities.  There are two sets of quests for both factions; one for level 60 characters, which involve the Wickerman Festival and another for characters of any level.

**Treats for Jesper and Spoops**

Just like during [Children’s Week](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-childrens-week-guide/) the Orphan’s of Azeroth need a short change hero and you’ve got just enough copper and silver to fit the bill.  Two kiddos are sick and so can’t go out to trick or treat this year.  So head on over to the orphanages in Orgrimmar and Stormwind to meet them to see what you can do to help make their Hallow’s End special.

Important!  Before leaving either of these cities, make sure you get the Flight Path for them, especially Orgrimmar, or making this trek could be a slog.

**Alliance** players will find [Jesper](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15310) in the orphanage in Cathedral Square.  He’s interested in a trade of candies, but you’re fresh out.  Pick up the quest [Hallow’s End Treats for Jesper!](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8311) from him and head out to stock up on Hallow’s End treats from the innkeepers of the main cities.

[![Classic Wow Hallow's End Guide Images Jesper](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-WoW-Hallows-End-Guide-Images-Jesper.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-WoW-Hallows-End-Guide-Images-Jesper.jpg)

Jesper



* [Flexing for Nougat](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8356): Go to [Innkeeper Alison](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/6740) in Stormwind and flex your mighty biceps for her to get some [Stormwind Nougat](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20492).
* [Incoming Gumdrop](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8355): Hop on the Deeprun tram and head to Ironforge to meet up with [Talvash del Kissel](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/6826).  He wants you to do a train emote for him and if you do, he’ll give you a [Gnomeregan Gumdrop](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20494).
* [Chicken Clucking for a Mint](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8353): Leave Tinker town now, and circle around to The Commons to see [Innkeeper Firebrew](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/5111). He’d like to see a Chicken Dance.  So do one for him and he’ll treat you to an [Ironforge Mint](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20490).
* [Dancing for Marzipan](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8357): Now leave Ironforge and head over to Menethil Harbor to take a ship to Darnassus.  Use the tunnel that takes you to Loch Modan, then take the second tunnel north to Dune Algaz.  After that, just follow the road north to about the middle of the zone map, then west until you reach Menethil.  [Innkeeper Saelienne](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/6735) wants desperately to see you dance.  Dance for her!    Now she will give you a [Darnassus Marzipan](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20496).

From here, head back to Jesper in Stormwind and give him all of your well earned Hallow’s End treats.  In return he will give you 30 [Hallow’s End Pumpkin Treat](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20557)s!  It’s often a good idea to set Stormwind as your hearth before you set out, so you can easily return there once you have the Darnassus Marzipan.

**Horde** players can find the little orc girl, [Spoops](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15309), in the Orgrimmar orphanage within the Valley of Honor.  She’s also sick and would like to trade some of her [Hallow’s End Pumpkin Treat](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20557)s for some different candy.  Take her quest, [Hallow’s End Treats for Spoops!](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8312), so that you can make her Hallow’s End wishes come true!

[![Classic Wow Hallow's End Guide Images Spoops](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-WoW-Hallows-End-Guide-Images-Spoops.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-WoW-Hallows-End-Guide-Images-Spoops.jpg)

Spoops



* [Flexing for Nougat](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8359): First, head over to the Valley of Strength and visit with [Innkeeper Gryshka](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/6929).  If you show off your muscley arms and flex for her, she’ll give you an [Orgrimmar Nougat](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20493).
* [Incoming Gumdrop](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8358): Next, you’ll be heading to Sen’Jin Village at the far south end of Durotar to find [Kali Remik](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11814).  He wants to see you do a train emote, so Chugga, Chugga and get you some o’ dem delicious [Darkspear Gumdrop](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20495).
* [Dancing for Marzipan](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8360): From Sen’Jin, you can either head all the way back to Orgrimmar, OR you can swim south along the coast until you get to Ratchet.  If you don’t have the Thunder Bluff flight path already, then swimming is going to be the fastest route for you, and you’ll have to walk from there to The Crossroads and then far south until you reach the gates of Mulgore.  [Innkeeper Pala](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/6746) in the Lower Rise wishes that you dance for her.  If you do, she will give you some [Thunder Bluff Marzipan](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20497).
* [Chicken Clucking for a Mint](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8354): Now, go to the central staircase and elevator and take it up to the flight master.  Take a wyvern to Orgrimmar, then take another elevator up to the skyway, so that you can hop a zeppelin to the Tirisfal Glades.  When you arrive, head straight south from the zeppelin tower and enter the Undercity.  Look for [Innkeeper Norman](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/6741) in the central area, close to the elevators up to the surface and do a chicken dance for him.  He will reward you with an [Undercity Mint](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20491).

You can either hop a zeppelin, or hearth back to Orgrimmar now and return to Spoops to turn your candies in to her.  She will gratefully repay you for your kindness with 30 [Hallow’s End Pumpkin Treat](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20557)s.

Mages who can create portals to the main cities will find themselves at a distinct advantage with these quests, no matter what faction they are in.  So make friends with a mage if you can, or offer a tip for their services.

[![Classic Wow Hallow's End Guide Images Mage Portal](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-WoW-Hallows-End-Guide-Images-Mage-Portal.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-WoW-Hallows-End-Guide-Images-Mage-Portal.jpg)

**Pranking Quests**

What is Hallow’s End without a good prank?  Horde *and* Alliance players can have some mischievous fun *and* get their hands on some [Hallow’s End Pumpkin Treat](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20557)s during this spooky time of year if they wish.

**Horde** players should seek out [Darkcaller Yanka](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15197) in the Tirisfal Glades, nearby the Wickerman statue to pick up either of the following quests.

* [Stinking Up Southshore](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/1657): Stink up Southshore with stink bombs!
* [Rotten Eggs](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8322): Spoil the Southshore’s ale with rotten eggs!

[![Classic Wow Hallow's End Guide Images Yanka](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-WoW-Hallows-End-Guide-Images-Yanka.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-WoW-Hallows-End-Guide-Images-Yanka.jpg)

**Alliance** can seek out [Sergeant Hartman](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15199) in Southshore to accept both of these fun quests.

* [The Power of Pine](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8373): Counter the Forsaken’s foul stink bombs with the power of pine!
* [Crashing the Wickerman Festival (PvP)](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/1658): Check out the Wickerman Festival and see what those creepy Forsaken are up to!

[![Classic Wow Hallow's End Guide Images Hartman](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-WoW-Hallows-End-Guide-Images-Hartman.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-WoW-Hallows-End-Guide-Images-Hartman.jpg)

It should be noted that trying to complete any of these quests will likely flag the player as PvP.  So attempt them at your own risk.

Wickerman Ceremony and Buff
---------------------------

One of the major events of Hallow’s End is the ceremonial lighting of [The Wickerman](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/180433) following a speech from Lady Silvanus Windrunner, the leader of the Forsaken faction.  This takes place at the border of the Tirisfal Glades and the Silverpine Forest at 8PM server time.  Once Lady Sylvanus finishes her speech and  the burning of the Wickerman is complete, the Forsaken in attendance smear the ashes from the pyre onto their faces as a symbolic gesture.

The Wickerman itself offers an extremely potent buff called the [Invocation of the Wickerman](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/24705), which conveys a 25% increase in health, mana and stamina regeneration.

[![Classic Wow Hallow's End Guide Images Wickermanjpg](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-WoW-Hallows-End-Guide-Images-WickermanJPG.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-WoW-Hallows-End-Guide-Images-WickermanJPG.jpg)

To get the buff, Horde players need only loot the [Wickerman Ember](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/180437) from the Wickerman, which is just outside the Ruins of Lordaeron in the Tirisfal Glades, between the hours of 8PM and 6 am server time.

Alliance players will have a *much* more difficult time getting the [Invocation of the Wickerman](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/24705), as they will have to contend with [Wickerman Guardian](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/15195)s that surround the towering effigy.  These guardians drop the [Wickerman Guardian Ember](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/180574) on the ground when they perish, allowing you to loot them and acquire the buff.  They are level 60 Elites, so you will likely need a group to defeat them and likely have to pull them one at a time.  Be careful.  If you’re going after this buff anyway, go ahead and grab the above quest in Southshore and get credit for scouting the Wickerman at the same time.

That’s all the fun there is for this year, kiddies!  Have a wonderful and spooky Hallow’s End, and remember, have fun!
