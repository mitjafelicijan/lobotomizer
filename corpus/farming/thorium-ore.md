# Thorium Ore Farming Routes for Classic WoW

This Thorium Ore farming guide will show you the routes that I use for farming Thorium Ore in Classic WoW.

Some of the areas changed in Burning Crusade Classic because some mobs became non-elites, but the farming routes are still the same. Level 70 players will just have an easier time farming because you can avoid pulling most mobs.

**Mining skill requirement:**

*   Small Thorium Vein: 245
*   Rich Thorium Vein: 275

## Un'goro Crater

Low level players should skip the cave to the south.

## Eastern Plaguelands

The red line is filled with level 57-58 elites, so if you have bad gear, you should probably just skip that part entirely unless you have stealth. With some practice, you can usually get through only aggroing a few of them.

## Burning Steppes

The two caves marked with red circles are filled with level 50 mobs, so lower level players might want to skip them. (depends on gear and level)

## Winterspring

Level 70 players can ignore these notes below. You can farm the full map.

1.  The mobs in this cave are not that hard to kill, so it's worth clearing for most classes. (depends on gear)
2.  Most classes can enter at least the first part of the cave without pulling aggro. You can try going deeper depending on your gear.
3.  There are a lot of elites patroling inside this gorge, but you can usually pass most of them without pulling aggro. Sometimes you have to kill 1 or 2.
4.  This area is not recommended for most players because it's hard to farm here without dying. Really depends on your class and your experience in avoiding mobs.

## Silithus

**Burning Crusade Classic:** I would only recommend this route to level 70 players or classes with stealth.

**Classic Era:**Â Recommend mostly for Rogues because the hives are filled with elites. Rogues can skip most mobs with stealth, but they still have to fight a few of them.

Moving between the three hives in Silithus is a great way to get a lot of Thorium. Each hive is separated into 3 parts, so make sure to clear all 3 before you move to the next.

If you see that the mining nodes are not respawning when you get back to the hive where you started, you should try to mine a few small thorium veins around the edge of the map while moving between the hives. (only level 70 players will have this problem)
