Scattered all across the realms and nations of Azeroth is one thing that appeals to every player, no matter which faction, class, or race.  Treasure.  In every zone in the game you can find at least one container filled with random loot hidden away from prying eyes.  Sometimes they’re in caves, sometimes in fortresses and sometimes even on top of high peaks.  The point is – there’s treasure to be found, and if you want to be the one to find it, listen carefully.

The aim of this guide is to help you find the locations, and in some situations, methods of procuring, every loot chest in the game.  It also offers some helpful tips on how to acquire these treasured containers without dying, as it is often easy to do when searching for them.  The chests themselves are often the same object appearing in more than one zone and they respawn regularly.

Dwarves will be especially good at this since their [Find Treasure](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2481) racial ability allows them to see nearby chests on the minimap. Rogues and Druids will also have an easier time getting to chests thanks to [Stealth](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1784) and [Prowl](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5215).

Starting Zones
--------------

To get started, we’ll take a look at the starting zones and the chests that can be acquired within them.

* [Battered Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/2843) (Version A) only contains low-level food and poor (gray) quality equipment.
* [Battered Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/106318) (Version B) can contain 6-slot bags as well as some low-level crafting materials and recipes.

### [Dun Morogh](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/1)

In the Dwarven and Gnome starting zone of Dun Morogh, check in the southwestern part of the map, in the most southwestern part of the Coldridge Valley, for [Battered Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/2843) (Version A). Look for [Battered Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/106318) (Version B) scattered throughout the rest of the main part of the zone.

### [Elwynn Forest](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/12)

In the starting lands of the humans, look pretty much all over. [Battered Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/2843) (Version A) is predominantly found in the very early parts of the zone, near Northshire Abby, while [Battered Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/106318) (Version B) can be found throughout Elwynn.

### [Teldrassil](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/141)

Within the boughs of the great tree Teldrassil resides both the night elf capital of Darnassus, as well as the night elf starting village of Shadowglen. [Battered Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/2843) (Version A) can be found exclusively in Shadowglen, while [Battered Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/106318) (Version B) is encountered throughout the zone.

Teldrassil Chest Locations

### [Durotar](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/14)

Orc and Troll players can find many of these chests at Tiragarde Keep, as well as the canyon northeast of Razor Hill. Be wary in the canyon though, as the harpies there are numerous and can sometimes swarm and overwhelm unprepared players. Only [Battered Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/106318) (Version B) appears in this zone.

[![Classic Treasure Chest Hunting Guide Images Durotar](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-Treasure-Chest-Hunting-Guide-Images-Durotar.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-Treasure-Chest-Hunting-Guide-Images-Durotar.jpg)

Durotar Chest Locations

### [Mulgore](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/215)

The Battered Chests in Mulgore tend to be around the outskirts of the zones, often in caves, or other tucked away places.  There are quite a few of them, but they are scattered all around. Only [Battered Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/106318) (Version B) appears in this zone.

[![Classic Treasure Chest Hunting Guide Images Mulgore](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-Treasure-Chest-Hunting-Guide-Images-Mulgore.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-Treasure-Chest-Hunting-Guide-Images-Mulgore.jpg)

### [Tirisfal Glades](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/85)

Like Elwynn Forest and Teldrassil, the starting zone for the Forsaken has two types of Battered Chests to find. [Battered Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/2843) (Version A) is found exclusively in Deathknell. [Battered Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/106318) (Version B) is found more widespread throughout the zone. Be very careful when hunting for chests in Agamand Mills, as it is *very* easy to find oneself completely outnumbered by the Scourge here.

[![Classic Treasure Chest Hunting Guide Images Deathknell](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-Treasure-Chest-Hunting-Guide-Images-Deathknell.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Classic-Treasure-Chest-Hunting-Guide-Images-Deathknell.jpg)

* [Battered Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/2849) (Version D) contains similar loot to Version C.
* [Solid Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/2850) (Version A) contains similar loot to the Battered Chests, but with 10-slot bags and some slightly higher item level equipment possible.
* [Solid Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/2852) (Version B) contains similar loot to Version B.

### [Ashenvale](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/331)

In Ashenvale, look for [Battered Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/2849) (Version D) almost exclusively in the northeast section of the map. You’ll find [Solid Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/2850) (Version A) throughout the middle of the map and [Solid Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/2852) (Version B) mostly in the eastern parts of the zone, near Splintertree Post and Horde territory.

Always be wary in The Barrens at low levels, as the level of mobs can change swiftly and suddenly as you traverse the zone. You’ll also find some [Solid Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/2850) (Version A) in the most southwestern corner of the map.

The rest of the zone, especially the eastern most section, is filled with [Solid Chest](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/2850) (Version A). Be wary throughout Redridge, as the Gnolls and Blackrock Orcs here are abundant and like to stealth and wait for the unprepared traveler.
