Iridescent Pearls are one of the most sought-after items at low levels in WoW Classic. They serve as core crafting material for multiple recipes, being used by the [Blacksmithing](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/season-of-discovery-sod-blacksmithing-guide/), [Leatherworking](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/season-of-discovery-sod-leatherworking-guide/), [Tailoring](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/season-of-discovery-sod-tailoring-guide/), and [Enchanting](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/season-of-discovery-sod-enchanting-guide/) professions. This guide will show you where you can farm [Iridescent Pearl](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5500)s and how to acquire them as fast as possible.

Iridescent Pearls can be dropped by a large variety of mobs, however, their drop chance is extremely low, with most mobs having around 0.02%-00.6% chance to drop an [Iridescent Pearl](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5500). Just like in the real world, they can be often found hiding inside clams. There are two specific types of clams at this low-level bracket that consistently drop [Iridescent Pearl](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5500)s: the [Giant Clam](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/19018) and the [Thick-shelled Clam](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5524). The former type can be found throughout multiple regions of Azeroth, often at deep depths while the latter can be looted from Murlocs and Naga!

Giant Clam Farming Locations
----------------------------

The first method of farming [Iridescent Pearl](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5500)s is opening [Giant Clam](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/19018)s found throughout Azeroth. Each Giant Clam has a 4% chance to drop an [Iridescent Pearl](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5500). Since they are usually found at deep depths, [Underwater Breathing](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/how-to-breathe-underwater/) effects can be extremely helpful for farming them.

In terms of efficiency, Druids using the [Acquatic Form](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/1066) have the best performance since their swimming speed is greatly improved.

Thick-shelled Clam Farming Locations
------------------------------------

There are three main spots where you can acquire Thick-shelled Clams: the Bluegill Marsh in Wetlands, the Western Strand in Hillsbrad Foothills, and inside [Blackfathom Deeps](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/blackfathom-deeps/) in Ashenvale.

Each [Thick-shelled Clam](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5524) has a 3% chance to drop an [Iridescent Pearl](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5500).

#### Bluegill Marsh ~ Wetlands

Bluegill Murloc Village ~ Bluegill Marsh

By far the best spot to farm [Iridescent Pearl](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5500)s is the Bluegill Marsh in Wetlands. This place is packed with murlocs that have a high respawn rate, with each spot spawning groups of 4-5 mobs. The Bluegill Murloc Tribe features a variety of murlocs, with the majority of them having no special attacks. There is only a single pack of mobs that spawn healing totems that can be found near the Lost Fleet.

The main reason why this is the perfect area for farming the pearls is not the high respawn rate in itself, but rather the very high drop chance of [Thick-shelled Clam](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5524)s. This spot is best used by classes that can AoE mobs quickly such as Hunters and Mages, especially since the area is highly contested. Classes that manage to tag mobs instantly will have an easier time farming in this spot.

#### Western Strand ~ Hillsbrad Foothills

The Torn Fin Murloc Tribe on the Western Strand

This farming spot would have been perfect if the Torn Fin Murlocs wouldnâ€™t have liked magic so much. Besides the high level of the Torn Fin Murlocs, the main issue with those mobs is that the majority of them are casters. Not only do the [Torn Fin Tidehunters](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2377) spam you with [Frost Nova](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/865), but the [Torn Fin Oracles](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2376) spam with you [Lightning Bolt](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/9532) while also healing any injured Murloc in their vicinity.

#### Blackfathom Deeps ~ Ashenvale

[![blackfathom deeps map location ashenvale](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackfathom-Deeps-Map-Location-Ashenvale-1024x542.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blackfathom-Deeps-Map-Location-Ashenvale.jpg)

Blackfathom Deeps Naga

The elite Naga of Blackfathom Deeps will drop [Thick-shelled Clam](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5524)s from time to time which can drop [Iridescent Pearl](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5500)s. However, they are quite hard to farm solo since they are Elite Mobs. From an efficiency point of view, you are better off simply farming in the Bluegill Marsh. You may favor Blackfathom Deeps in case all the farming spots in Wetlands are already taken.
