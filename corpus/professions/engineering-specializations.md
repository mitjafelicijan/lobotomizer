Players with a high enough [Engineering](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12656) skill in WoW Classic are able to specialize in either [Gnomish Engineering](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20220) or [Goblin Engineering](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20221). These specializations allow you to craft some powerful schematics, but you can only have one specialization at a time.

In this guide we’ll go over the differences between the two specializations, how you can learn them, how to renew your membership card, and how to change specializations.

#### Engineering Specializations in Season of Discovery

Season of Discovery makes Engineering a lot more flexible by allowing players to learn most recipes from **both** specializations without having to go through the process of switching. To do so, you’ll need to complete a new chain of quests that was added to the game for this season. Note that the only recipes you’ll be able to learn are the ones that have “Gnomish” or “Goblin” in the name. So if you want both of the Engineering pets, or you want to change your portal trinket, you’ll have to change specializations the old-fashioned way.

Once you’ve learned your specialization, head to The Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles to start a new quest:

* **Gnomish Engineers:** [Gnomish Solutions](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/82008), offered by Fizzbizz Coppercoil (77.0, 77.2)
* **Goblin Engineers:** [Goblin Solutions](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/81987), offered by Maximillian “The Greaser” (79.8, 77.2)

Completing this quest chain will allow you to complete the quest [Hush Money](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/82004)/[Hush Money](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/82013) once per week, which awards an [Engineering Exchange Ticket](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/220775) that can be used to purchase one of the opposite specialization recipes from the same NPC who gave you the quests.

Gnomish vs. Goblin Engineering
------------------------------

Broadly speaking, you should take [Gnomish Engineering](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20220) if you are more interested in gadgets and [Goblin Engineering](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20221) if you want to blow things up. Some of the items that can be made with one specialization can be purchased and used by other Engineers without needing to have the specialization. Others are Bind-on-Pickup or require the associated specialization to use.

There are only three items that actually require a specialization in order to use them:

* [Dimensional Ripper – Everlook](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18984) (Goblin)
* [Ultrasafe Transporter: Gadgetzan](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18986) (Gnomish)
* [World Enlarger](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18660) (Gnomish)

Bind-on-Pickup items are marked (BoP) below so you can see what you will be able to get with your specialization.

There are a couple of schematics that sound like they should require a specialization, but don’t. [Goblin Jumper Cables](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7148)/[Goblin Jumper Cables XL](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18587) and [Gnomish Cloaking Device](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/4397) can be made by any Engineer.

How to Change Engineering Specializations
-----------------------------------------

In Vanilla WoW, there is only one way to change your Engineering specialization, and that’s by **dropping the profession and leveling it again from scratch**. This is obviously very expensive and time consuming to do, but it will allow you to craft and use almost all of the exclusive items for both specializations.

To drop Engineering, open the Skills tab in your character window and click on the crossed-out circle beside your Engineering skill. *You will lose ALL of your current skill and ALL of your recipes,* so be sure that you want to do this before you confirm!

Now you’ll have to level [Engineering](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/engineering-1-300/) again from scratch. When you reach 200 skill level and want to pick up the other specialization, head to Steamwheedle Port in Tanaris and look for a small house north of town (65.4, 18.6). Inside you’ll find a book called **Soothsaying for Dummies** on a table. Interact with this book to get your new specialization. You won’t have to complete either of the quests like you did the first time around.
