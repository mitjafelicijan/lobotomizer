Before you go to Hammerfall, it’s best to have at least **75 Mageweave cloth** and **70 Runecloth** as this will save you coming back to see the Doctor.

For this quest you have to save 15 patients before 6 of them die. You will be in a room with 6 cots, stand in the middle so you are close to all of them. You might need to change the camera angle and zoom out to see them all.

Use (“V”) to show all the patients status on screen. You will have special triage bandages (add them to your action bar/hot key) which should be applied to Critically injured, then Badly injured, and then injured. Once you started treating a patient do not interupt, just finish treating that patient before moving on to another patient. You should select your next patient before your are finished with the first one, then all you have to do is hit you hot key to start the next one.

You MUST use the special bandages you are given or you WILL FAIL.
