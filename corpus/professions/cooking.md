[SoD Cooking Guide](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/season-of-discovery-sod-cooking-guide/)

[Cooking](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/18260) is a secondary profession within WoW Classic. As the name might suggest, you’ll use raw materials found from monsters and fishing to create food that can heal you and even give combat bonuses! Because cooking can create valuable consumables at max level, it becomes an important skill with high demand. Check out the rest of this guide to level your cooking from 1-300, regardless of your faction and whether or not you want to fish!

Because the cooking skill is a secondary profession, it won’t take up one of your two main profession slots, meaning **any** character, race, or class can learn cooking. To level your cooking skill, you’ll need raw meat that you can find on the corpses of specific beasts.

Cooking is an excellent skill for casual or serious players. Questing, especially alone, is often difficult and requires the frequent use of food to continue fighting. Unless you’re a mage, this means you’ll need to buy food from a vendor to keep yourself sustained.

With cooking, you can make yourself free food with meat you’ll pick up just by leveling. At max skill level, cooking is excellent for providing food with combat bonuses. These recipes require materials that are harder to obtain and the resulting foods are generally much more expensive.

When it comes to leveling methods, there are two traditional routes. You can level your cooking using the standard method, which entails collecting meat from beasts all across Azeroth. Alternatively, you can also choose the pescatarian route by taking the fishing route. We’ll cover both strategies in this guide, as well as noting key differences for Alliance and Horde players.

Trainer Locations
-----------------

Training plays a huge role in leveling your cooking, as you’ll need new recipes learned from trainers and vendors both to reach even higher levels. For any specific recipes you’ll need to find, we’ll tell you where to find them in the section where you need them. For *general* cooking trainers that offer you level cap increases, you can find them at these locations:

* **Apprentice (1-75) –** Like most other professions, simply ask a guard in any major city where you can find the Cooking Trainer.
  + For ![Wow Alliance Crest](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Alliance-Crest.png) Alliance, that means Stormwind, Ironforge, or Darnassus.
  + For the ![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Horde-Crest.png) Horde, you can go to Orgrimmar, Thunder Bluff, or Undercity.
* **Journeyman (75-150) –** Return to the same city you originally learned Cooking in. This is the last time you’ll visit this trainer!
* **Expert (150-225) –** To learn Expert Cooking, you’ll actually need to learn it from a cookbook! How fitting.
  + For ![Wow Alliance Crest](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Alliance-Crest.png) Alliance players, you can purchase [Expert Cookbook](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/16072) from [Shandrina](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3955) in Mystral Lake, Ashenvale, or find it on the Auction House.
  + ![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Horde-Crest.png) Horde players can purchase [Expert Cookbook](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/16072) from [Wulan](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/12033) in Shadowprey Village, Desolace or from the Auction House.
* **Artisan (225-300) –** Things take a different twist for Artisan Cooking, which you’ll need to complete a quest to unlock.
  + You can acquire the quest [Clamlette Surprise](https://warcraftdb.com/live/quest/6610) from [Dirge Quikcleave](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/8125) in Gadgetzan, Tanaris. This quest simply requires you to collect the following: 20 [Alterac Swiss](https://warcraftdb.com/live/item/8932), 12 [Giant Egg](https://warcraftdb.com/live/item/12207), 10 [Zesty Clam Meat](https://warcraftdb.com/live/item/7974).

Important Notes
---------------

Before you start cooking, there are a few key things to keep in mind! Depending on what faction you play and how you want to tackle leveling, you’ll have a very different experience!

### Faction

Although both ![Wow Alliance Crest](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Alliance-Crest.png) Alliance and ![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Horde-Crest.png) Horde players have fairly similar leveling routes to reach 300 cooking, there are several instances where a different recipe is used. The first and last 75 levels are identical for both factions, but the middle levels are where the route differs.

The exception to this is Night Elves who do not have wolves or boars in their starting zone. Instead they learn to craft [Kaldorei Spider Kabob](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/5472) from a quest of the same name in their starting zone.

For those sections, each faction will have their own instructions.

### Fishing

One of the easier ways of leveling Cooking is by simultaneously leveling your [Fishing](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7732) skill. You can entirely source your way to 225 Cooking from Fishing alone, but this will require several hours of fishing in order to reach a high enough level to catch the fish you’ll need to cook.

If you already plan on leveling your Fishing skill, this is a perfect opportunity for you to freely level your Cooking skill at the same time. It is important to note that there is also a fishing quest required to learn Artisan Fishing, which you’ll need to catch the fish required to cap your cooking.

Because fishing drastically changes the recipes you’ll use, there is an entirely separate section in this guide for if you want to fish rather than kill beasts.

[![WoW Classic Cooking - Fishing Guide](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Cooking-Fishing-Guide-1024x485.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Cooking-Fishing-Guide.jpg)
### Quests

![WoW Classic Quest Icon](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/quest-x150.png)

Throughout the guide, you’ll notice there are a few quests that you’ll need to do. These quests are required to learn the recipe you’ll use, but fortunately most quests are as simple as collecting a set amount of ingredients and handing them in.

For anything more advanced, we’ll illustrate how to complete the quest. Additionally, we’ll mention when you need to purchase a specific recipe from a vendor!

Materials Needed
----------------

Depending upon your method and faction, your material needs will differ. Keep in mind totals will vary based upon your RNG, but these should serve as a good guideline of what to expect. Here are the totals for each leveling method:

Leveling Cooking **Without** Fishing
------------------------------------

### 1-75: Apprentice Cooking

Welcome to the wonderful world of cooking! Where flavor is king and quality is never an afterthought! Just kidding, you’ll use any old cut of meat you can find!

To get started, learn the Apprentice [Cooking](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2550) skill from any Cooking Trainer. While you’re there, train the first recipe below.

##### 1-40: [Charred Wolf Meat](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2679), [Roasted Boar Meat](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2681), or [Kaldorei Spider Kabob](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/5472) x 40

* **Source**: Trainer
* **Ingredients**:
  + 1x [Stringy Wolf Meat](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2672)/[Chunk of Boar Meat](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/769)/[Small Spider Leg](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/5465)

For your first cooking recipe, make any combination of the above to reach 40 Cooking. You can kill boars and wolves found around Elwynn Forest, Dun Morogh, Durotar, or Mulgore for their meat. If you are playing as a Night Elf, wolves and boars are not an option, so hunt spiders all over Teldrassil to get the legs you need for a Kaldorei favorite!

##### 40-75: [Smoked Bear Meat](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6890) x35

* **Source**: [Recipe: Smoked Bear Meat](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6892)
  + Sold by ![Wow Alliance Crest](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Alliance-Crest.png) [Drac Roughcut](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/1465) at Thelsamar in Loch Modan
  + Sold by ![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Horde-Crest.png) [Andrew Hilbert](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3556) at The Sepulcher in Silverpine Forest
* **Ingredients**:
  + 1x [Bear Meat](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/3173)

You’ll need to purchase the next recipe from a vendor. Then kill bears from the surrounding zones. Smoke enough bear meat to reach at least 75 Cooking. Then train and keep going to 90.

### 75-150: Journeyman Cooking

Head to any Cooking Trainer to learn Journeyman [Cooking](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/3102). For ![Wow Alliance Crest](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Alliance-Crest.png) Alliance, pick up the next recipe while you’re there. The next few recipes will vary based on your faction.

##### 75-85 (Wow Alliance Crest Alliance): [Crab Cake](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2683) x10

* **Source**: Trainer
* **Ingredients**:
  + 1x [Crawler Meat](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2674)
  + 1x [Mild Spices](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2678)

Now things start to get a little different! Learn Journeyman Cooking while also picking up this nifty little recipe for some delectable crab cake. Make just 10 of them, but don’t eat them all at once! Don’t forget to buy the [Mild Spices](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2678) from a cooking vendor near your trainer. You can find some pinchy crawlers over in Westfall near the coast.

##### 75-90 ( Horde): [Smoked Bear Meat](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6890) x20

* **Source**: [Recipe: Smoked Bear Meat](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6892)
  + Sold by [Andrew Hilbert](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3556) at The Sepulcher in Silverpine Forest
* **Ingredients**:
  + 1x [Bear Meat](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/3173)

Continue killing and cooking bears until you’ve reached 90 in Cooking. You can still get the bear meat easily enough in Silverpine Forest and you’ll already be there so it is convenient.  If you are looking for a higher drop rate and are high enough level (at least 28), the [Giant Ashenvale Bear](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3811) drops meat at a 71% rate, which is the highest.

##### 85-100 (Wow Alliance Crest Alliance): [Cooked Crab Claw](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2682) x15

* **Source**: [Recipe: Cooked Crab Claw](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2698)
  + Sold by [Kendor Kabonka](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/340) in Stormwind City
* **Ingredients**:
  + 1x [Crawler Claw](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2675)
  + 1x [Mild Spices](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2678)

Crabfest continues, but now you’re cooking whole crab claws. Pick up this recipe in Stormwind. Cook crab claws until you reach triple digits for your Cooking level! These also drop from crawlers, so keep farming them in Westfall.

##### 90-130 ( Horde): [Dig Rat Stew](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/5478) x40

* **Source**: [Recipe: Dig Rat Stew](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/5487)
  + [Dig Rat Stew](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/862) quest from [Grub](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3443) in The Barrens.
* **Ingredients**:
  + 1x [Dig Rat](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/5051)

While the Alliance gets to make some tasty crab dishes, the Horde gets the pleasure of the delicacy that is *dig rat stew*. This requires you to complete a quest of the same name from [Grub](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3443), who you’ll find in one of the towers that hug the mountain north of the road between Ratchet and The Crossroads. Once you have the quest, head south to the Bael’dun Excavation site in The Barrens and collect [Dig Rat](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3444)s in Bael Modan to fulfill the quest requirements and reach 125 in Cooking.

##### 100-130 (Wow Alliance Crest Alliance): [Seasoned Wolf Kabob](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/1017) x30

* **Source**: [Recipe: Seasoned Wolf Kabob](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2701)
  + [Seasoned Wolf Kabobs](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/90) quest from [Chef Grual](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/272) at Darkshire in Duskwood
* **Ingredients**:
  + 2x [Lean Wolf Flank](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/1015)
  + 1x [Stormwind Seasoning Herbs](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2665)

Yes, wolf is actually quite a versatile meat. You’re going to turn it into a kabob now, which requires you to complete a quest in Duskwood to learn the recipe. You’ll need to collect 10 [Lean Wolf Flank](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/1015)s from the wolves in the zone and then pick up the herbs from [Felicia Gump](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/1303) in a flower shop in the Canal District of Stormwind City.

##### 130-150: [Curiously Tasty Omelet](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/3665) x20

* **Source**: [Recipe: Curiously Tasty Omelet](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/3682)
  + Sold by ![Wow Alliance Crest](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Alliance-Crest.png) [Kendor Kabonka](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/340) in Stormwind City
  + Sold by ![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Horde-Crest.png) [Nerrist](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/1148) at Grom’gol Base Camp in Stranglethorn Vale
  + Sold by ![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Horde-Crest.png) [Keena](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2821) at Hammerfall in Arathi Highlands
* **Ingredients**:
  + 1x [Raptor Egg](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/3685)
  + 1x [Hot Spices](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2692)

For this next part, you’ll actually need to head to a few spots. First you’ll need to purchase another recipe if you haven’t already. The easiest way for Horde players to get the recipe for this one is to take the zeppelin from Orgrimmar to Grom’gol Base Camp in Stranglethorn Vale and purchase it from [Nerrist](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/1148). You can also get it from [Keena](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2821) at Hammerfall in Arathi Highlands and may want to, as hunting raptors for the eggs for this recipe can be done from the Arathi Highlands.

Alliance can pick up the recipe from [Kendor Kabonka](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/340) in Stormwind. To make these omelets, you’ll need (surprise!) eggs, but more specifically, raptor eggs! You can get them from raptors around Arathi Highlands, but might have more luck with the raptors in the Wetlands just north of Grim Batol. Don’t forget to buy [Hot Spices](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2692) from a cooking vendor!

### 150-225: Expert Cooking

Upon reaching 150 skill, you’ll need to purchase an [Expert Cookbook](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/16072) to unlock Expert [Cooking](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/3413). ![Wow Alliance Crest](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Alliance-Crest.png) Alliance can buy it at Mystral Lake in Ashenvale from a vendor named [Shandrina](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3955) (or on the Auction House). ![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Horde-Crest.png) Horde can make their way to Shadowprey Village in Desolace to purchase an [Expert Cookbook](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/16072) from [Wulan](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/12033) (or buy it from the Auction House).

##### 175-200 ( Horde): [Roast Raptor](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12210) x25

* **Ingredients**:
  + 1x [Raptor Flesh](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12184)

Head to Grom’gol Base Camp in Stranglethorn Vale to purchase this recipe if you haven’t already, and don’t forget some spices! Roast up some raptor from the surrounding jungle until you’ve reached 200 in Cooking.

##### 200-225: [Spider Sausage](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/17222) x25

* **Source**: Trainer
* **Ingredients**:
  + 2x [White Spider Meat](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12205)

Do spiders even have any meat to make a sausage? Don’t try to understand it, but make 25 of these. The spiders in Dustwallow Marsh are a great source for this.

### 225-300: Artisan Cooking

Upon reaching 225 skill, you’ll need to complete a quest to unlock Artisan [Cooking](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/18260).

#### Artisan Cooking Quest

If you’ve made it this far, great work! But you’ve also probably noticed there isn’t an obvious way of unlocking Artisan [Cooking](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/18260). This is because you need to complete a quest to do so! Both ![Wow Alliance Crest](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Alliance-Crest.png) Alliance and ![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Horde-Crest.png) Horde players will need to be at least level 35 and head to Gadgetzan, Tanaris and pick up [Clamlette Surprise](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/6610) from [Dirge Quikcleave](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/8125). As a side note, **don’t forget to purchase the recipe for Tender Wolf Steak** from him as well.

The quest itself is simple, but requires you to acquire ingredients that may consume your time. You’ll need to collect 20 [Alterac Swiss](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/8932), 12 [Giant Egg](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12207), and 10 [Zesty Clam Meat](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7974).

* [Giant Egg](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12207)s can be found from owlbeasts in The Hinterlands
* [Zesty Clam Meat](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7974) can be found in clams looted off turtles in Tanaris
* [Alterac Swiss](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/8932) can be purchased from [Ben Trias](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/4981) in Stormwind or [Innkeeper Pala](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/6746) in Thunder Bluff

Once you have all items, head back to Dirge to unlock Artisan [Cooking](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/18260)! If you didn’t do so earlier, purchase the Tender Wolf Steak recipe as well. The rest of your Cooking leveling journey is fairly straightforward, although will take a lot of time for you to grind out the materials.

Wolves drop the meat while owlbeasts drop the eggs.

For ![Wow Alliance Crest](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Alliance-Crest.png) Alliance, purchase your cookbook from [Shandrina](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3955) at Mystral Lake in Ashenvale. ![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Horde-Crest.png) Horde players can seek out [Wulan](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/12033) at Shadowprey Village in Desolace.

* ![Wow Alliance Crest](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Alliance-Crest.png) Alliance players can pick up the next recipe before leaving Hillsbrad Foothills, and head to Arathi Highlands to fish.
* ![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Horde-Crest.png) Horde players need to pick up this recipe at Shadowprey Village in Desolace, which is also a great spot to fish.

This step will take a while, so don’t be surprised if it takes upwards of 100 fish. When you’re done, you’ll be ready for the home stretch!

### 225-300: Artisan Cooking

Upon reaching 225 skill, you’ll need to complete a quest to unlock Artisan [Cooking](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/18260).

#### Artisan Cooking Quest

If you’ve made it this far, great work! But you’ve also probably noticed there isn’t an obvious way of unlocking Artisan [Cooking](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/18260). This is because you need to complete a quest to do so! Both ![Wow Alliance Crest](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Alliance-Crest.png) Alliance and ![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Horde-Crest.png) Horde players will need to be at least level 35 and head to Gadgetzan, Tanaris and pick up [Clamlette Surprise](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/6610) from [Dirge Quikcleave](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/8125). As a side note, **don’t forget to purchase the recipe for Tender Wolf Steak** from him as well.

The quest itself is simple, but requires you to acquire ingredients that may consume your time. You’ll need to collect 20 [Alterac Swiss](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/8932), 12 [Giant Egg](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12207), and 10 [Zesty Clam Meat](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7974).

* **Ingredients:**
  + 1x [Raw Spotted Yellowtail](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/4603)

Both factions converge once again, this time in the sunny desert of Tanaris. Make your way to Steamwheedle Port, and purchase the recipe for Spotted Yellowtail *and* Poached Sunscale Salmon from [Gikkix](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/8137). You can easily catch Spotted Yellowtail right off the dock. Continue cooking them until you reach 250 in Cooking!

![Wow Alliance Crest](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Alliance-Crest.png) Alliance and ![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Horde-Crest.png) Horde players will both now migrate to Bloodvenom Falls in Felwood. You should’ve already purchased the Poached Sunscale Salmon recipe from [Gikkix](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/8137) in Steamwheedle Port. Cook up some salmon until you’ve reached at least 275 in Cooking! One recipe to go!

##### 275-300: [Mightfish Steak](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/13934) x30

* **Source:** [Recipe: Mightfish Steak](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13948)
  + ![Wow Alliance Crest](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Alliance-Crest.png) Alliance: [Viviana](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/7947) at Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas
  + ![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Horde-Crest.png) Horde: [Sheendra Tallgrass](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/8145) at Camp Mojache in Feralas
* **Ingredients:**
  + 1x [Large Raw Mightfish](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13893)
  + 1x [Hot Spices](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2692)
  + 1x [Soothing Spices](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/3713)

This last one is a bit of a doozy, but it is absolutely worth it. ![Wow Alliance Crest](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Alliance-Crest.png) Alliance players will need to go to The Feathermoon Stronghold in Feralas to purchase the Mightfish Steak recipe from [Vivianna](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/7947). ![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Horde-Crest.png) Horde players must head to Camp Mojache in Feralas to buy it from [Sheendra Tallgrass](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/8145). This is also a great time to stock up on Hot and Soothing Spices!

Once you’ve got the recipe, you can catch Mightfish in Scalebeard’s Cave, Azshara. Because Azshara requires a minimum of 250 fishing, lures might be a good idea for faster farming. Either way, after about 30 Mightfish, you should reach max Cooking. Congratulations!
