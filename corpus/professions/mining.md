[SoD Mining Guide](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/season-of-discovery-sod-mining-guide/)

Welcome to Warcraft Tavern’s 1-300 Mining Guide! In this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know to max out Mining, from gathering routes to trainer locations.

**Why Mining?**

If your primary profession is either [Blacksmithing](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/blacksmithing-1-300/) or [Engineering](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/engineering-1-300/), Mining is practically a prerequisite. Both professions require materials that can only be acquired through Mining. You could choose to not take up Mining as your second profession, but consequently, you’ll have to spend an impractical amount of money on the materials you need to raise your Blacksmithing and Engineering.

Apart from being the natural prerequisite for Engineering and Blacksmithing, Mining will generate a huge amount of revenue due to the various bars required by the other professions for crafting recipes. You will generate gold early through selling materials such as [Copper Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2770)/[Copper Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2840), as they are materials required in bulk for blacksmithing and engineering early. Copper Ore will also offer a large amount of revenue due to other miners choosing to buy it off the auction house early rather than mine it themselves. [Steel Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3859) will overtake copper when you reach the middle of your miner journey. When you reach the end of your journey, [Mithril Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3858)/[Mithril Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3860)/[Thorium Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/10620)/[Thorium Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/12359) will be your main gold source apart from [Arcane Crystals](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/12363) and [Blood of the Mountain](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11382). Of course, we can’t forget the incredibly valuable [Azerothian Diamonds](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/12800)!

Leveling Mining 1-300
---------------------

Once you find the closest Mining Trainer and grab your trusted Mining Pick, turn on the Find Mineral ability from your skill book and get ready to embark on a long journey. **Make sure to empty your bags!** Mining can be entirely optimized by choosing **good farming hours** (depending on the server population) and **optimal farming spots**.

When it comes to mining, there are two ways to level up the profession. **Firstly, you level it up by gathering ore and gems from mining nodes throughout the whole world. The second way is to level up the profession through (Smelting)**, an ability gained only by Miners that allows them to turn Ore into Bars. Both ways are valid and entirely doable, but for the sake of performance and showcasing the best and most optimal route, you will need to combine both Mining and Smthing.

All you need to get started is a [Mining Pick](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2901) and to find the closest Mining Trainer. To smelt ore into bars, you simply need to be near a forge and have the requisite ores in your bags. Then, open your Spellbook, click the General tab, and click the Smelting skill.

**Keep in mind that every single vein can be mined several times until it is completely depleted**. Don’t forget this, as if you don’t deplete a vein, you might leave valuable goods behind for other players, while also preventing the respawn of a new mining node. However, even if every single vein can be mined several times, you will only gain 1 skill point from each individual vein, no matter how many times you may be able to mine it. Each vein will offer several materials, ranging from the very ore themselves to precious jewels and stones. Mines and caverns will almost always provide spawn nodes for ore veins, those are the best places to check.

### List of Mining Nodes available

Location and Purpose of Special Veins:

**Rethban Ore** **–** *Found in any Copper or Tin mine in Redridge Mountains, veins will drop these randomly*.  
Needed for a quest given by Foreman Oslow, in Redridge Mountains. He should be located on the southeast side of Lakeshire. This isn’t really related to mining, since mobs will drop it just as frequently, but I added it by request.

**Incendicite Ore** **–** *Found in the Wetlands, in the cave directly north of Dun Algaz on the map.*  
Incendicite is the objective of the alliance quest Search for Incendicite, which is given to you by Pilot Stonegear in Dun Morogh.

**Indurium Ore –** *Found inside Uldaman, in the various tunnels*.  
Indurium is the objective of the neutral quest Indurium Ore given by Pozzik at the race track in Thousand Needles.

**Lesser Bloodstone Ore –** *Found in Arathi Highlands, in the northeast corner of the map.*  
Lesser Bloodstone Ore is the objective of the alliance quest Favor for Krazek, given by Krazek in Booty Bay.

**Dark Iron Ore –** *Found in Blackrock Depths and Molten Core, deposits can be found in any of the numerous caverns.*Dark Iron serves two purposes. You can either smelt it to create bars for any of the Blackrock Depths exclusive recipes, or you can turn it into Lokhtos Darkbargainer in the bar in Blackrock Depths to increase your Thorium Brotherhood faction. When you get your Thorium Brotherhood faction to Honored and above, Lokhtos will sell you some really nice crafting recipes. Before you get too excited about that prospect, read the paragraph below about smelting Dark Iron Ore.

To create one Dark Iron Bar, you need 8 Dark Iron Ore, and you can only smelt Dark Iron at the Dark Forge, which is located near the portal to Molten Core. Before you can smelt it, you need to learn how to smelt Dark Iron Ore from Gloom’rel deep in Blackrock Depths in the 7 Ghosts room. He’ll teach you how to smelt it if you give him 20 Gold Bars, 10 Truesilver Bars, and 2 Star Rubies. You can only make items that require Dark Iron Bars at the Black Anvil, which is on the other side of the instance where Lord Incendius is located.


Mining Routes
-------------

Starting routes will be separate for both Alliance and Horde, each faction having specific starting zones with an abundance of available nodes to be mined. These zones will mainly consist of 1-150 zones, after which the zones will be shared.

### **Alliance Gathering Routes**

**Apprentice (1-75)**

**1-75**

1-75 will consist of gathering [Copper Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2770)/[Tin Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2771) and smelting [Copper Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2770) into [Copper Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2840).

**[Elwynn Forest](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/12)**

![elwynn forest wow classic](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Elwynn-Forest-Wow-classic.jpg)

1. Copper Ore (1 node)
2. Copper Ore (1 node)
3. Copper Ore (1-3 nodes)

**[Dun Morogh](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/1)**

![dun morogh wow classic](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Dun-Morogh-Wow-Classic.jpg)

1. Copper Ore (1-2 nodes)
2. Copper Ore (Mine, 3-4 nodes)

11. Copper Ore (1 node)
12. Copper Ore ( Mine, 4-5 nodes)
13. Copper Ore (2 nodes)
14. Copper Ore (1 node)

Teldrasill does not offer any ore veins, so we will have to look towards Darkshore to find ore.

**[Darkshore](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/148)**

![darkshore wow classic](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Darkshore-Wow-Classic.jpg)

1. Copper Ore (1 node)
2. Copper Ore (1-2 nodes)
3. Copper Ore (1 node)
4. Copper Ore/Silver Ore (1 node, possible spawn point for Silver Ore)
5. Copper Ore
6. Copper Ore/Silver Ore (1 node, possible spawn point for Silver Ore)
7. Copper Ore (1 node)
8. Tin Ore/Copper Ore (2 nodes)
9. Copper Ore (1 node)
10. Copper Ore/Tin Ore (3 nodes)
11. Copper Ore (1 node)
12. Copper Ore (1 node)

As mentioned at the beginning of the section, we will combine Mining from the ore veins and the process of Smelting to level up our Mining faster. You can smelt Copper Ore up until you reach 47 skill points before the ability turns green. After which you can choose to keep smelting Copper Ore until you consume everything that you have gathered so far from the routes or choose to sell the ore directly on the Auction House. Depending on the realm’s economy.

You can gain skill points even if the Copper Ore Smelting bar turned green, up until you reach 65 skill points. Choosing to mine up until you reach 30 skill points and then smelting everything will give you enough raw materials to start smelting Bronze Bars as they require both Copper Bars and Tin Bars.

Once we reach 65 points, we have the choice of mining Tin Ore to reach 75 skill points. Don’t forget to go to the closest mining trainer in order to learn Journeyman Mining once you reach 50 Skill Points!!

Alternatively, you can choose to buy copper ore from the auction house and smelt it until you reach 70 skill points and buy 10 to 15 Tin bars to smelt Bronze bars once you reach 65 skill points in order to reach 75 skill points. However, that choice can be better applied to high-level players that wish to level up mining only through Smelting and have the necessary gold to buy every material from the Auction House instead of mining it themselves.

Copper Ore can be found throughout all the starting areas, making it the most widespread ore that can be mined. You will stumble across Copper Ore in many regions, we chose to show you the most optimal routes which can be followed in starting zones that display low-level mobs. You will also be able to find plenty of Copper Ore in the following regions:

* The Barrens
* Loch Modan
* Westfall
* Redridge Mountains
* Silverpine Forest
* Stonetalon Mountains
* Duskwood
* Thousand Needles
* Ashenvale
* Hillsbrad Foothills
* Wetlands
* Desolace
* Alterac Mountains
* The Deadmines
* Wailing Caverns.

**Journeyman (75-150)**

**75-150**

75-150 will consist of mining [Tin Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2771), [Silver Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2775), Smelting [Tin Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3576), Smelting [Bronze Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2841), Smelting [Silver Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2842)  
Tin ore can be mined efficiently up until you reach 125 skill points! You can abuse this in order to level up your skill points fast. Remember all those Copper Bars we created? We will use them to create Bronze Bars once we acquire a stack or two of Tin Ore.

Keep in mind that Silver Ore Veins just like Gold Ore Veins have a random spawn location and you will often stumble across them randomly. They usually occupy a node that is generally used by a different type of ore such as Copper Ore in Darkshore or Iron Ore in Arathi Highlands and Hillsbrad Foothills.

Silver Ore spawn locations: Alterac Mountains, Arathi Highlands, Ashenvale, Badlands, Darkshore, Desolace, Duskwood, Dustwallow Marsh, Feralas, Hillsbrad Foothills, Loch Modan, Redridge Mountains, Searing Gorge, Silverpine Forest, Stonetalon Mountains, Stranglethorn Vale, Swamp of Sorrows, Tanaris, The Barrens, The Hinterlands, Thousand Needles, Westfall, and Wetlands

You can also choose to mine in The Barrens, however, you might find it quite difficult considering it is full-fledged Horde territory filled with both a lot of Horde players and NPCs.

**[The Barrens](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/17)**

![the barrens wow classic](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-barrens-wow-classic.jpg)

Just like Ashenvale, The Barrens has a large concentration of mining nodes, most of them being Tin Ore Veins. They are spread throughout the whole map, often replacing Copper Ore veins.

1. Tin Ore (4-5 nodes in the area)
2. Tin Ore (1-2 nodes)
3. Tin Ore (2-3 nodes)

13. Tin Ore (Several nodes spread in the area)
14. Tin Ore (1-2 nodes)
15. Tin Ore (1-2 nodes)
16. Tin Ore (1 node)

Now that we showed you the routes for Tin Ore, you have two choices. You can choose to mine as much Tin Ore and Silver Ore that you can find up until you level up your skill to 125 or you can choose to mine around 4 stacks of Tin Ore and turn them into Tin Bars. By choosing the second method you will be able to utilize the Copper Bars that you previously created and turn them and the Tin Bars into Bronze Bars.

By the time you reach 90 skill points, Smelting Bronze Bars will now be seen as green in the Smelting skill. You can keep continuing to smelt Bronze Bars until the bar turns grey but it will require a larger amount of Tin Bars. You should also smelt any Silver Ore that you find, as it will guarantee a skill point at this level.

Once you reach 100 Smelting Silver Bars will turn to yellow, at 115 Bronze Bars will be grayed out while Silver Bars will turn into green. At this point, you can safely return to mine more Tin Ore. Once you reach 125 skill points, you will be granted the ability to mine Iron Ore! Remember to go train Expert Mining at the nearest Mining Trainer once you reach 125. You can safely mine Iron Ore up until you reach 150 skill points

**Routes for Iron Ore**:

In Ashenvale we will present a bit of a different situation, the spawn nodes or Iron Ore are randomized to some extent. For example, you will be able to find several Iron Ore nodes all around Warsong Lumber Camp and the roads that lead to it. You will also find a lot of nodes spawned near the edges of the mountains that span around the Kanyewood Retreat. We will however attempt to offer you a precise location and a possible route just like in the other zones.

**Expert (150-225)**

**150-225**  
150-225 will consist of mining [Iron Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2772), Smelting [Gold Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3577), Mining [Gold Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2776), Mining [Mithril Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3858)  
You can mine Iron Ore up until you reach 175 skill points. Alternatively, you can buy Gold Ore from the Auction House and smelt it into Gold Bars up until 185 skill points once you reach 155 skill points.

Once you reach 175 you will be able to finally mine one of the most expensive materials in World of Warcraft, Mithril.  
Mithril can be found in a multitude of places, although, you will have to expect heavy competition for this Ore. Keep in mind, Mithril Veins have randomized spawning locations. We will display the maps as routes, however, we will not be able to pinpoint the exact number of possible spawn nodes but we will leave insights as to which areas of the zone have higher density nodes.

**Mithril Ore routes:**

**[Tanaris](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/440)**

![tanaris wow classic](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Tanaris-Wow-Classic.jpg)

In Tanaris, Mithril Ore has multiple possible spawn nodes, we will mention them in the list as “Clusters” due to the multitude of possible spawn locations.

1. High cluster of nodes at The Noxious Lair
2. High cluster of nodes at The Noxious Lair
3. Possible spawn node west of Gadgetzan
4. Mithril Ore spawn point near the ruins
5. Possible Mithril Ore spawn point south of Steamwheedle Port
6. High cluster east of The Caverns of Time
7. High cluster below of The Caverns of Time
8. Cluster next to the Hive
9. Cluster around the Hive
10. High cluster near the mountain side of Uldum
11. High cluster next to the entrance of Un’Goro Crater
12. High cluster next to the entrance of Un’Goro Crater

![swamp of sorrows wow classic](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Swamp-of-sorrows-Wow-classic.jpg)

Swamp of sorrows has a few nodes that span across the ridge of the mountains to the north side of the map.  
You can find two nodes in the lake next to the Temple.  
You will find a high quantity of Mithril deposits in the cave to the south side of the Temple of Atal’Hakkar.  
The only downside of the cave found to the south side of the Temple is that the Mithril veins can sometimes be replaced by Iron Ore veins and Gold Ore Veins.

1. Mithril Ore

![eastern plaguelands classic](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Eastern-Plaguelands-Classic.jpg)

Eastern Plaguelands displays a small circle in which you can find Mithril vein deposits. However, the spawn nodes can be replaced by other veins such as Truesilver or Iron Ores.

1. Mithril Ore/Truesilver Ore/Iron Ore
2. Mithril Ore/Truesilver Ore
3. Mithril Ore
4. Mithril Ore

![western plaguelands](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Western-Plaguelands.jpg)

You will find several spawn points of Mithril deposits all around the Ruins of Andorhal, however, same as with Eastern Plaguelands, many of the nodes will be replaced by another type of nodes.

1. Mithril Ore
2. Mithril Ore

![winterspring classic mithrill](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Winterspring-Classic-Mithrill.jpg)

You will find several spawn nodes to the east side of Winterspring, however, some of the nodes will be replaced by Thorium Veins, which in fact, is very good news for us! There are multiple spawn points for Mithril in the area, a rough estimate would be around 20 possible spawn nodes.

1. Mithril Ore/Thorium Ore
2. Mithril Ore
3. Mithril Ore /Thorium Ore
4. Mithril Ore

**[Feralas](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/357)** 

![feralas wow classic](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Feralas-wow-classic.jpg)

You can find several isolated spawn nodes throughout Feralas. But you will have 3 main caves that you will want to farm as much as possible. Those sites have a very large amount of possible spawn nodes and will lend you a lot of Mithril.

1. Mithril Ore
2. Mithril Ore
3. Mithril Ore

Besides those main spots, you can also find Mithril in Desolace, Azshara, Badlands, Searing Gorge, Alterac Mountains, Silithus, Dustwallow marsh, Blasted Lands, Un’Goro Crater, Stonetalon Mountains, Thousand Needles, Hillsbrad Foothills, Maraudon, Uldaman.

Sadly, you can not gain skill points by Smelting Mithril, you will have to level up Mining from 175 up until 230. Once you reach 225 you will have to train Artisan Mining at the nearest Mining Trainer.


**Artisan (225-300)**

Will consist of mining [Mithril Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3858), [Truesilver Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7911), [Dark Iron Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11370), [Thorium Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/10620). Sadly, you can not use Smelting to advance in skill points any longer. However, once you reach 230 you can start mining Truesilver Ore veins and Dark Iron Ore Veins. Truesilver Vein deposits have randomized spawning locations (much like Gold and Silver) and can be found throughout the same routes presented earlier for Mithril. They do share common spawn nodes.

Truesilver deposits can also be found in: Winterspring, Burning Steppes, Eastern Plaguelands, The Hinterlands, Un’Goro Crater, Azshara, Tanaris, Western Plaguelands, Badlands, Searing Gorge, Blasted Lands, Silithus, Feralas, Stranglethorn Vale, Arathi Highlands, Desolace, Alterac Mountains, Dustwallow Marsh, Hillsbrad Foothills, Swamp of Sorrows, Maraudon, and Stonetalon Mountains.

One type of ore you can abuse to level up Mining without having to travel far and wide is Dark Iron ore. You can effectively mine it up until 270. It is a faster option than farming Thorium, even if it is available to you after reaching 250 skill points.

**Dark Iron Ore Routes:**

**[Burning Steppes](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/46)**

![burning steppes 2](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Burning-Steppes-2.jpg)

Burning Steppes is one of the two main zones in which you can find Dark Iron Ore deposits. They are spread throughout the entirety of the map, but you can usually find clumps of them in Dreadmaul Rock, along with Mithril Ore.

**[Searing Gorge](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/51)**

![searing gorge dark iron](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Searing-Gorge-dark-iron.jpg)

Searing Gorge is the second zone in which you will find Dark Iron Ore deposits. They are spread through the whole map, you will find clumps of nodes in The Cauldron and East to the Thorium Point to the West Side of it. As we mentioned earlier, you can effectively farm Dark Iron Ore up until 270 skill points, after which you will be able to finally farm Thorium.

Thorium comes into two variants, there are Small Thorium Veins and Rich Thorium Veins. You can mine Rich Thorium Veins can only be mined when you reach 275 skill points. Thorium can be found only in a couple of places in Azeroth:  
The following places are: Winterspring, Eastern Plaguelands, Azshara, Burning Steppes, Un’Goro Crater, Western Plaguelands, Alterac Valley, and Dire Maul, Silithus, Blasted Lands, Searing Gorge, Tanaris, The Hinterlands, Feralas, and Blackrock Spire  
The only issue with Thorium is that it has a set respawn timer of 15 minutes and a very randomized spawn rate. Generally speaking, you will often find very few nodes of Thorium, as they do not spawn in large amounts. Not only this but you will face fierce competition for it.

**Routes for Rich Thorium:**

**[Winterspring](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/618)**

![winterspring classic thorium](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Winterspring-Classic-Thorium.jpg)

![ungoro rich thorium](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ungoro-Rich-Thorium.jpg)

1. Thorium Ore (4-5 possible spawn nodes in the middle of the map)
2. Thorium Ore (6 possible spawn nodes)
3. Thorium Ore (1 possible node)

**Routes for Small Thorium Veins:**

As Small Thorium Veins are far more spread and have a more randomized spawn mode than Rich Thorium Veins, we will display routes with an estimated density of spawned nodes.

**[Un’Goro Crater](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/490)**

![ungoro small thorium](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ungoro-small-thorium.jpg)

The highest density of thorium can be found in the cave to the east side of Marshal’s Refuge. A medium-density can be found to the south side of the center of the map.

**[Silithus](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/1377)**

![silithus](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Silithus.jpg)

Silithus displays small thorium veins all around the edges of the map with a slightly higher concentration of nodes at certain small locations marked by circles on the map.

**[Burning Steppes](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/46)**

![burning steppes small thorium](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Burning-Steppes-small-thorium.jpg)

Image

Small Thorium Veins share spawn nodes with Mithril and Dark Iron Ore, you can find them scattered throughout the whole map but with a higher density in Dreadmaul Rock.

**[Searing Gorge](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/51)**

![searing gorge](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Searing-Gorge.jpg)

Image

Searing Gorge offers 2 caves with a high density of possible spawn nodes for Small Thorium Veins. You can also find spawn nodes around Thorium Point.

**[Western Plaguelands](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/28)**

![western plaguelands small thorium](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Western-Plaguelands-small-thorium.jpg)

Western Plaguelands has the highest concentration of thorium around the road that leads to Hearthglen and the forest around it. There is also one small cave to the north side of the map which offers a high respawn rate of thorium ore veins.

**[Eastern Plaguelands](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/139)**

![eastern plaguelands classic small thorium](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Eastern-Plaguelands-Classic-small-thorium.jpg)

Unlike Rich Thorium Veins, Small Thorium Veins in Eastern Plaguelands have a very randomized spawn location. They are quite hard to catch but they will spawn around the two main spots presented on the map.

**[Blasted Lands](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/4)**

![blasted lands](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Blasted-lands.jpg)

Blasted Lands has two main zones with concentrated spawn locations of Small Thorium Ore Veins, both of those zones are caves. You can also find three nodes that spawn in the vicinity of The Dark Portal and some possible spawn locations near Dreadmaul Hold.


### **Horde Gathering Routes**

**Apprentice (1-75)**

13. Copper Ore (1 node)
14. Copper Ore (2-3 nodes, random spawn)

As mentioned at the beginning of the section, we will combine both Mining from the ore veins and the process of Smelting to level up our Mining faster. You can smelt Copper Ore up until you reach 47 skill points before the ability turns green. After which you can choose to keep smelting Copper Ore until you consume everything that you have gathered so far from the routes or choose to sell the ore directly on the Auction House. Depending on the realm’s economy.

You can gain skill points even if the Copper Ore Smelting bar turned green, up until you reach 65 skill points. Choosing to mine up until you reach 30 skill points and then smelting everything will give you enough raw materials to start smelting Bronze Bars as they require both Copper Bars and Tin Bars.

Once we reach 65 points, we have the choice of mining Tin Ore to reach 75 skill points. Don’t forget to go to the closest mining trainer in order to learn Journeyman Mining once you reach 50 Skill Points!!

Alternatively, you can choose to buy copper ore from the auction house and smelt it until you reach 70 skill points and buy 10 to 15 Tin bars to smelt Bronze bars once you reach 65 skill points in order to reach 75 skill points. However, this choice mostly applies to high-level players that wish to level up mining only through Smelting and have the necessary gold to buy every material from the Auction House instead of mining it themselves.

Copper Ore can be found throughout all the starting areas, making it the most widespread ore that can be mined. You will stumble across Copper Ore in many regions, we chose to show you the most optimal routes which can be followed in starting zones that display low-level mobs.

You will also be able to find plenty of Copper Ore in the following regions:  
The Barrens, Loch Modan, Westfall, Redridge Mountains, Silverpine Forest, Stonetalon Mountains, Duskwood, Thousand Needles, Ashenvale, Hillsbrad Foothills, Wetlands, Desolace, Alterac Mountains, The Deadmines, and Wailing Caverns


**Journeyman (75-150)**

**75-150**

75-150 will consist of mining [Tin Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2771), [Silver Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2775), Smelting [Tin Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3576), Smelting [Bronze Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2841), Smelting [Silver Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2842)  
Tin ore can be mined efficiently up until you reach 125 skill points! You can abuse this in order to level up your skill points fast. Remember all those Copper Bars we created? We will use them to create Bronze Bars once we acquire a stack or two of Tin Ore.  
Keep in mind that Silver Ore Veins just like Gold Ore Veins have a random spawn location and you will often stumble across them randomly. They usually occupy a node that is generally used by a different type of ore such as Copper Ore in Darkshore or Iron Ore in Arathi Highlands and Hillsbrad Foothills.

  
Silver Ore spawn locations: Alterac Mountains, Arathi Highlands, Ashenvale, Badlands, Darkshore, Desolace, Duskwood, Dustwallow Marsh, Feralas, Hillsbrad Foothills, Loch Modan, Redridge Mountains, Searing Gorge, Silverpine Forest, Stonetalon Mountains, Stranglethorn Vale, Swamp of Sorrows, Tanaris, The Barrens, The Hinterlands, Thousand Needles, Westfall, and Wetlands

You can also choose to mine in Ashenvale, however, you might find it quite difficult considering the level of the mobs and the fact that it is a major contested territory.

![ashenvale tin ore 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ashenvale-Tin-Ore-1.jpg)

Tin ore spawns in Ashenvale in a very spread manner, you will be able to find nodes several feet apart from each other.

1. Tin Ore (4 nodes)
2. Tin Ore (2 nodes)
3. Tin Ore (several nodes spawned around the ridge)
4. Tin Ore (3-4 nodes in the area)
5. Tin Ore (several spawn nodes in the area)
6. Tin Ore (3 nodes)
7. Tin Ore (6 possible nodes in the area of the lake)
8. Tin Ore (huge amount of possible spawn nodes, between 9-10, but around 5 to 6 active at one time)
9. Tin Ore (4-5 nodes around the lake)
10. Tin Ore (4-5 nodes around the lake)
11. Tin Ore (several spawn nodes around the area with a long distance between each other)
12. Tin Ore (several spawn nodes around the area with a long distance between each other )
13. Tin Ore (2 nodes)

Now that we showed you the routes for Tin Ore, you have two choices. You can choose to mine as much Tin Ore and Silver Ore that you can find up until you level up your skill to 125 or you can choose to mine around 4 stacks of Tin Ore and turn them into Tin Bars. By choosing the second method you will be able to utilize the Copper Bars that you previously created and turn them and the Tin Bars into Bronze Bars.

By the time you reach 90 skill points, Smelting Bronze Bars will now be seen as green in the Smelting skill. You can keep continuing to smelt Bronze Bars until the bar turns grey but it will require a larger amount of Tin Bars. You should also smelt any Silver Ore that you find, as it will guarantee a skill point at this level.

Once you reach 100 Smelting Silver Bars will turn to yellow, at 115 Bronze Bars will be grayed out while Silver Bars will turn into green. At this point, you can safely return to mine more Tin Ore. Once you reach 125 skill points, you will be granted the ability to mine Iron Ore! Remember to go train Expert Mining at the nearest Mining Trainer once you reach 125. You can safely start mining Iron Ore up until you reach 150 skill points

**Routes for Iron Ore:**

**[Stonetalon Mountains](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/406)**

For example, you will be able to find several Iron Ore nodes all around Warsong Lumber Camp and the roads that lead to it. You will also find a lot of nodes spawned near the edges of the mountains that span around the Kanyewood Retreat. We will however attempt to offer you a precise location and a possible route just like in the other zones.

We have shown you some of the optimal routes for Iron Ore, you can also find Iron ore in Desolace, Thousand Needles, Alterac Mountains, Badlands, Swamp of Sorrows, Dustwallow Marsh, Tanaris, Feralas, Uldaman, Razorfen Kraul, the Hinterlands, Searing Gorge.


**Expert (150-225)**

**150-225**  
150-225 will consist of mining [Iron Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2772), Smelting [Gold Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3577), Mining [Gold Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2776), Mining [Mithril Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3858)  
You can mine Iron Ore up until you reach 175 skill points. Alternatively, you can buy Gold Ore from the Auction House and smelt it into Gold Bars up until 185 skill points once you reach 155 skill points. Once you reach 175 you will be able to finally mine one of the most expensive materials in World of Warcraft, Mithril. Mithril can be found in a multitude of places, although, you will have to expect heavy competition for this Ore.

Keep in mind, Mithril Veins have randomized spawning locations, we will display the maps as routes, however, we will not be able to pinpoint the exact number of possible spawn nodes but we will leave insights as to which areas of the zone have higher density nodes.

**Mithril Ore routes:**

**[Tanaris](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/440)**

![tanaris wow classic 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Tanaris-Wow-Classic-1.jpg)

In Tanaris, Mithril Ore has multiple possible spawn nodes, we will mention them in the list as “Clusters” due to the multitude of possible spawn locations.

1. High cluster of nodes at The Noxious Lair
2. High cluster of nodes at The Noxious Lair
3. Possible spawn node west of Gadgetzan
4. Mithril Ore spawn point near the ruins
5. Possible Mithril Ore spawn point south of Steamwheedle Port
6. High cluster east of The Caverns of Time
7. High cluster below of The Caverns of Time
8. Cluster next to the Hive
9. Cluster around the Hive
10. High cluster near the mountain side of Uldum

![swamp of sorrows wow classic 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Swamp-of-sorrows-Wow-classic-1.jpg)

Swamp of sorrows has a few nodes that span across the ridge of the mountains to the north side of the map.  
You can find two nodes in the lake next to the Temple  
You will find a high quantity of Mithril deposits in the cave to the south side of the Temple of Atal’Hakkar.  
The only downside of the cave found to the south side of the Temple is that the Mithril veins can sometimes be replaced by Iron Ore veins and Gold Ore Veins.

1. Mithril Ore
2. Mithril Ore
3. Mithril Ore
4. Mithril Ore
5. Mithril Ore
6. Mithril Ore

**[Eastern Plaguelands](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/139)**

![eastern plaguelands classic 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Eastern-Plaguelands-Classic-1.jpg)

Eastern Plaguelands displays a small circle in which you can find Mithril vein deposits. However, the spawn nodes can be replaced by other veins such as Truesilver or Iron Ores.

1. Mithril Ore/Truesilver Ore/Iron Ore
2. Mithril Ore/Truesilver Ore
3. Mithril Ore
4. Mithril Ore
5. Mithril Ore

**[Western Plaguelands](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/28)**

![western plaguelands 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Western-Plaguelands-1.jpg)

You will find several spawn points of Mithril deposits all around the Ruins of Andorhal, however, same as with Eastern Plaguelands, many of the nodes will be replaced by another type of nodes.

1. Mithril Ore
2. Mithril Ore
3. Mithril Ore
4. Mithril Ore

7. Mithril Ore
8. Mithril Ore

**[Winterspring](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/618)**

![winterspring classic mithrill 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Winterspring-Classic-Mithrill-1.jpg)

You will find several spawn nodes to the east side of Winterspring, however, some of the nodes will be replaced by Thorium Veins, which in fact, is very good news for us!  
There are multiple spawn points for Mithril in the area, a rough estimate would be around 20 possible spawn nodes.

1. Mithril Ore/Thorium Ore
2. Mithril Ore
3. Mithril Ore /Thorium Ore
4. Mithril Ore

**[Feralas](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/357)** 

![feralas wow classic 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Feralas-wow-classic-1.jpg)

You can find several isolated spawn nodes throughout Feralas. But you will have 3 main caves that you will want to farm as much as possible. Those sites have a very large amount of possible spawn nodes and will lend you a lot of Mithril.

1. Mithril Ore
2. Mithril Ore
3. Mithril Ore

Besides those main spots, you can also find Mithril in Desolace, Azshara, Badlands, Searing Gorge, Alterac Mountains, Silithus, Dustwallow marsh, Blasted Lands, Un’Goro Crater, Stonetalon Mountains, Thousand Needles, Hillsbrad Foothills, Maraudon, Uldaman.

Sadly, you can not gain skill points by Smelting Mithril, you will have to level up Mining from 175 up until 230. Once you reach 225 you will have to train Artisan Mining at the nearest Mining Trainer.


**Artisan (225-300)**

**225-300**

225-300 will consist of Mining [Mithril Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3858), [Truesilver Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7911), [Dark Iron Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11370), [Thorium Ore](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/10620). Sadly, you can not use Smelting to advance in skill points any longer.  
Once you reach 230 you can start mining Truesilver Ore veins and Dark Iron Ore veins. Truesilver veins deposits, much like Gold Ore Veins or Silver Ore Veins have randomized spawning locations. They can be found throughout the same routes presented earlier for Mithril. They do share common spawn nodes.

Truesilver deposits can also be found in: Winterspring, Burning Steppes, Eastern Plaguelands, The Hinterlands, Un’Goro Crater, Azshara, Tanaris, Western Plaguelands, Badlands, Searing Gorge, Blasted Lands, Silithus, Feralas, Stranglethorn Vale, Arathi Highlands, Desolace, Alterac Mountains, Dustwallow Marsh, Hillsbrad Foothills, Swamp of Sorrows, Maraudon, and Stonetalon Mountains.

One type of ore you can abuse to level up Mining without having to travel far and wide is Dark Iron ore. You can effectively mine it up until 270. It is a faster route than farming Thorium, even if it is available to you after reaching 250 skill points.

**Dark Iron Ore Routes:**

**[Burning Steppes](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/46)**

![burning steppes small thorium 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Burning-Steppes-small-thorium-1.jpg)

Burning Steppes is one of the two main zones in which you can find Dark Iron Ore deposits. They are spread throughout the entirety of the map, but you can usually find clumps of them in Dreadmaul Rock, along with Mithril Ore.

**[Searing Gorge](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/51)**

![searing gorge dark iron 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Searing-Gorge-dark-iron-1.jpg)

Searing Gorge is the second zone in which you will find Dark Iron Ore deposits. They are spread through the whole map, you will find clumps of nodes in The Cauldron and East to the Thorium Point to the West Side of it. As we mentioned earlier, you can effectively farm Dark Iron Ore up until 270 skill points, after which you will be able to finally farm Thorium.

Thorium comes into two variants, there are Small Thorium Veins and Rich Thorium Veins. You can mine Rich Thorium Veins can only be mined when you reach 275 skill points. Thorium can be found only in a few places in Azeroth:  
Winterspring, Eastern Plaguelands, Azshara, Burning Steppes, Un’Goro Crater, Western Plaguelands, Alterac Valley, and Dire Maul, Silithus, Blasted Lands, Searing Gorge, Tanaris, The Hinterlands, Feralas, and Blackrock Spire

The only issue with Thorium is that it has a set respawn timer of 15 minutes and a very randomized spawn rate. Generally speaking, you will often find very few nodes of Thorium, as they do not spawn in large amounts. Not only this but you will face fierce competition for it.

**Routes for Rich Thorium:**

**[Winterspring](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/618)**

![winterspring classic thorium 2](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Winterspring-Classic-Thorium-2.jpg)

1. Thorium Ore (Possible 5 spawn nodes)
2. Thorium Ore (Possible 6 spawn nodes)
3. Thorium Ore (10 possible spawn nodes, only a few at a time)
4. Thorium Ore (6-8 possible spawn nodes, again, only a few at a time)
5. Thorium Ore (6 possible spawn nodes, a few at a time)
6. Thorium Ore (Large area that can spwan Thorium nodes, few spawns at a time, impossible number of estimated spawn nodes)

**[Western Plaguelands](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/28)**

![western plaguelands rich thorium](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Western-Plaguelands-Rich-Thorium.jpg)

1. Thorium Ore (Cave, multiple spawn nodes)
2. Thorium Ore (above Hearthglen, 4-5 possible spawn nodes)
3. Thorium Ore (1 node)
4. Thorium Ore (1 node)

**[Eastern Plaguelands](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/139)**

![eastern plaguelands classic rich thorium 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Eastern-Plaguelands-Classic-rich-thorium-1.jpg)

2. Thorium Ore (6 possible spawn nodes)
3. Thorium Ore (6 possible spawn nodes)
4. Thorium Ore (6 possible spawn nodes)
5. Thorium Ore (2 possible spawn nodes)
6. Thorium Ore (5 possible spawn nodes)
7. Thorium Ore (8 possible spawn nodes)
8. Thorium Ore (3 possible spawn nodes)

**[Un’Goro Crater](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/490)**

![ungoro rich thorium 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ungoro-Rich-Thorium-1.jpg)

1. Thorium Ore (4-5 possible spawn nodes in the middle of the map)
2. Thorium Ore (6 possible spawn nodes)
3. Thorium Ore (1 possible node)

**Routes for Small Thorium Veins:**

As Small Thorium Veins are far more spread and have a more randomized spawn mode than Rich Thorium Veins, we will display routes with an estimated density of spawned nodes.

**[Un’Goro Crater](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/490)**

![ungoro small thorium 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ungoro-small-thorium-1.jpg)

The highest density of thorium can be found in the cave to the east side of Marshal’s Refuge. A medium-density can be found to the south side of the center of the map.

**[Silithus](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/1377)**

![silithus 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Silithus-1.jpg)

Silithus displays small thorium veins all around the edges of the map with a slightly higher concentration of nodes at certain small locations marked by circles on the map.

**[Burning Steppes](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/46)**

![burning steppes small thorium 2](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Burning-Steppes-small-thorium-2.jpg)

Small Thorium Veins share spawn nodes with Mithril and Dark Iron Ore, you can find them scattered throughout the whole map but with a higher density in Dreadmaul Rock.

**[Searing Gorge](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/51)**

![searing gorge 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Searing-Gorge-1.jpg)

Searing Gorge offers two caves with a high density of possible spawn nodes for Small Thorium Veins. You can also find spawn nodes around Thorium Point.

**[Western Plaguelands](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/28)**

![western plaguelands small thorium 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Western-Plaguelands-small-thorium-1.jpg)

Western Plaguelands has the highest concentration of thorium around the road that leads to Hearthglen and the forest around it. There is also one small cave to the north side of the map which offers a high respawn rate of thorium ore veins.

**[Eastern Plaguelands](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/139)**

![eastern plaguelands classic small thorium 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Eastern-Plaguelands-Classic-small-thorium-1.jpg)

Unlike Rich Thorium Veins, Small Thorium Veins in Eastern Plaguelands have a very randomized spawn location. They are quite hard to catch but they will spawn around the two main spots presented on the map.

**[Blasted Lands](https://wowclassicdb.com/zone/4)**

![blasted lands 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Blasted-lands-1.jpg)

Blasted Lands has two main zones with concentrated spawn locations of Small Thorium Ore Veins, both of those zones are caves. You can also find three nodes that spawn in the vicinity of The Dark Portal and some possible spawn locations near Dreadmaul Hold.
