[SoD Enchanting Guide](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/season-of-discovery-sod-enchanting-guide/)

Enchanting is a wonderful skill, harnessing the powers of magic to make a player gain extra power. The profession has always been a staple of the game, with the added utility and damage bonuses offered through the enchantments. In WoW Classic, enchanting will also be crucial for those looking to min-max their character in preparation for raiding.

The enchanting skill is probably the most useful profession in the entire game. If any player is concerned about maximizing their damage and survivability potential, they’ll require the boons granted from enchanting their gear.

Enchanters can add additional stats to several armor pieces, but they can also enchant weapons to do additional damage. This also makes the weapon cosmetically glow, another reason players will seek out an enchanter. One important difference from Retail WoW is that you cannot enchant rings or necklaces in WoW Classic.

In addition to adding stats to gear, enchanters can disenchant magical items of green quality or higher. This will convert the gear into enchanting materials, which are required to cast new enchants. This makes enchanting a great skill to pair with another crafting-based profession, preferably tailoring as it is a crafting profession that doesn’t require an accompanying gathering profession. Tailoring uses cloth found from monster drops to craft cloth armor for squishies.

Trainer Locations
-----------------

As with most other professions, early skill levels of enchanting can be learned at any major city. Once you reach expert level, you’ll need to travel to other regions of Azeroth to learn expert and artisan techniques. Here’s where you can find enchanting trainers:

* **Apprentice (1-75) –** Any major city! Just ask a guard where the enchanting trainer is and you’ll receive a marker on your map. If you’re Alliance, head to Stormwind, Ironforge, or Darnassus. Horde players can go to Thunder Bluff, Undercity, or Stormwind.
* **Journeyman (75-150) –** You can learn journeyman enchanting from the same trainer that taught you apprentice enchanting. This will the the last time you can raise your skill level cap with them.
* **Expert (150-225) –** Now, you’ll have to leave the comfort of the city. Alliance players must visit [Kitta Firewind](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11072), located at the top of the Tower of Azora in eastern Elwynn Forest. Horde players must seek out [Hgarth](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11074) in the Stonetalon Mountains.

Hgarth Location





* **Artisan (225-300)** – Once you’re at least 200 skill level in enchanting, you can train to become an artisan. All players must head to the dungeon of Uldaman in the Badlands to speak with master enchanter, [Annora](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11073).

### Uldaman Enchanting Trainer Location

Uldaman is a five-man dungeon located within the Badlands. It is known as an ancient Titan vault, and rightfully is filled with troggs and titanic constructs. It is recommended for players in the mid-high 40s level-wise, although can be entered as early as level 30.

There isn’t a good reason to enter Uldaman until at least level 35, as that is the level requirement to learn artisan enchanting. You still might have a difficult time at that level, as the instance is certainly geared towards higher level players. If you have a few higher level friends, consider asking them to run you through the dungeon. You can also wait until you’re at least level 40 to find a group to clear the dungeon together.

Before you start your journey to find [Annora](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11073), make sure you are well-stocked with as many enchanting materials as possible. You must fight several monsters and trek deep into the dungeon to find the master enchanter. The last thing you’d want is to find out you need a few more mats to reach a level requirement for a new enchantment being so far from a bank or auction house.

Annora is located in a fairly obscure location within Uldaman. There are actually two entrances to Uldaman. Many don’t know there is a back entrance located southeast of the main entrance. You’ll know you’re at the right place when you encounter a pack of elite troggs guarding a small cave. The back entrance is actually quite close to Annora’s location.

Once you’ve made your way inside Uldaman, you’ll want to locate a cavern found northwest of the Map Chamber. You’ll know you’re in the right spot when you find a tent and a room full of scorpions. Once you kill all the scorpions in the room, Annora will spawn in a corner and allow you to train in artisan enchanting.

Key Advice
----------

Pick up enchanting as soon as possible! You’ll pick up countless green items from monsters and quest rewards, which you can disenchant immediately into materials (as long as you have the proper enchanting level). This will also save you bag space in case you decided to hoard your green items for later.

If you’re starting enchanting from scratch without another profession, consider picking up tailoring so you can craft free magic equipment to disenchant. You can also offer to enchant the armor of other players as you skill up, who will often either pay or tip you for your services. This can help recover the cost of acquiring materials. You can also enchant your own armor and reapply the same enchant multiple times.

Be careful about what you disenchant! You can absolutely disenchant a strong item by accident. If you took off some armor or a weapon for cosmetic purposes, you might accidentally disenchant a piece. Make sure you’re always aware of what you’re disenchanting, and that you don’t lose something you need!

### 1-2

**[Runed Copper Rod](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/6218) x1 (1x Copper Rod + 1x Strange Dust + 1x Lesser Magic Essence)**

Enchanters require the use of a special tool to cast their enchantments. Every so often, you’ll be required to craft a new and more powerful one to cast new enchantments. This is the first one you’ll need and is very basic! You can find all of these materials from a enchanting supplies vendor found next to a trainer.

### 2-75

**[Enchant Bracer – Minor Health](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/7418) x74 (1x Strange Dust)**

The next step in your enchanting journey is extremely simple. Simply cast enchant bracer – minor health until you reach 75 enchanting. It will become yellow at 70, but shouldn’t require much extra to reach 75. Don’t forget to learn journeyman enchanting afterwards.

75-150 (Journeyman)
-------------------

Mats Required:

* 10x [Lesser Magic Essence](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/10938)

### 75-85

**[Enchant Bracer – Minor Deflection](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/7428) x10 (1x Lesser Magic Essence + 1x Strange Dust)**

You’ll keep on with the bracer enchants in this next step. You’ll want to reach 85 enchanting, which will take 10 casts of enchant bracer – minor deflection.

### 85-100

**[Enchant Bracer – Minor Stamina](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/7457) x15 (3x Strange Dust)**

Yet another bracer enchant! This one will give your wrist piece a whopping one extra stamina! Can you say jackpot? Cast enchant bracer – minor stamina 15 times until you reach the century mark for your enchanting level.

### 100-101

**[Runed Silver Rod](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/7795) x1 (1x Silver Rod + 6x Strange Dust + 3x Greater Magic Essence + 1x Shadowgem)**

For your hard work reaching 100 enchanting, you’re rewarded with the requirement of making another runed rod. This one is silver, and will require you to find a silver rod made by a blacksmith and a shadowgem looted from monster drops or purchased on the auction house.

### 101-105

**[Enchanter Bracer – Minor Stamina](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/7457) x4 (3x Strange Dust)**

Does this recipe look familiar? At this point, it will have turned yellow, so you may need to cast it an extra time or two. Enchant your bracers at least 4 times to reach 105 enchanting for the next recipe.

### 105-120

**[Enchant Bracer – Minor Agility](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/7779) x15 (2x Strange Dust + 1x Greater Magic Essence)**

Once again you have a new bracer enchantment, but this one offers an offensive bonus. It will give you a whopping one extra agility point, but serves as your first time boosting melee offense rather than defensive stats. Cast it 15 times to reach 120 enchanting.

### 120-130

**[Enchant Shield – Minor Stamina](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/13378) x10 (1x Lesser Astral Essence + 2x Strange Dust)**

You’re probably glad to see an enchant that doesn’t go on your bracers. This one is for a shield though, which might be problematic if you don’t wear one. Cast enchant shield – minor stamina 10 times on another player’s shield, or buy a cheap one from a vendor.

### 130-150

**[Enchant Bracer – Lesser Stamina](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/13501) x20 (2x Soul Dust)**

If you missed the wonderful experience of enchanting your bracers, fear no more as it makes a return for this recipe. This time, you’ll receive a stamina boost of +3, which actually starts to become meaningful. You’ll use soul dust for the first time with this recipe as well. Cast it 20 times to reach the halfway mark for your enchanting journey.

150-225 (Expert)
----------------

Mats Required:

* 1x [Golden Rod](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11128)
* 1x [Iridescent Pearl](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5500)
* 2x [Greater Astral Essence](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11082)
* 25x [Soul Dust](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11083)
* 20x [Lesser Mystic Essence](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11134)
* 86x [Vision Dust](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11137)

* 1x [Black Pearl](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7971)
* 2x [Greater Mystic Essence](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11135)

### 150-151

**[Runed Golden Rod](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/13628) x1 (1x Golden Rod + 1x Iridescent Pearl + 2x Greater Astral Essence + 2x Soul Dust)**

Once you reach 150 enchanting, you’ll want to learn expert enchanting to raise your skill level cap to 225. Horde players can find Hgarth in Stonetalon Mountains, while Alliance players can head to the Tower of Azora in Elwynn Forest to train with Kitta Firewind. The first recipe you’ll make after that will be your third runed rod, this time made of gold. A blacksmith can make you one, but you’ll also need to locate an iridescent pearl found within a clam.

### 151-160

**[Enchant Bracer – Lesser Stamina](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/13501) x9 (2x Soul Dust)**

You’ve already casted this enchant 20 times to reach 150, but you’ll need to do it at least 9 times to reach 160 enchanting. It will become yellow at 155, so you might need a few extra soul dust to get all the way.

### 160-165

**[Enchant Shield – Lesser Stamina](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/13631) x5 (1x Lesser Mystic Essence + 1x Soul Dust)**

Here’s another shield enchant for you! This one will add 3 stamina, but you’ll only need to cast it about 5 times. Do so until you reach 165 enchanting for your next recipe.

### 165-180

**[Enchant Bracer – Spirit](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/13642) x15 (1x Lesser Mystic Essence)**

Your bracer enchantments are starting to pick up power, with this recipe giving you +5 to your spirit. You can cast this 15 times to reach 180 enchanting, at which point you’ll cast yet another bracer enchant.

### 180-200

**[Enchant Bracer – Strength](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/13661) x20 (1x Vision Dust)**

If you’re a warrior or retribution paladin, you’ll benefit from the beefy +5 strength this next enchant will give you. +5 is no joke for a damage-boosting stat, so you’ll easily find other players that would be interested in receiving this. Cast it 20 times to reach 200 enchanting level.

### 200-201

**[Runed Truesilver Rod](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11145) x1 (1x Truesilver Rod + 1x Black Pearl + 2x Greater Mystic Essence + 2x Vision Dust)**

This will the the second-to-last runed rod you’ll need to make. The price takes another step up, as you’ll require a truesilver rod and a black pearl to make this wicked stick. Put it together and get ready for more bracer enchants!

### 201-205

**[Enchant Bracer – Strength](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/13661) x4 (1x Vision Dust)**

You’ve casted this enchant to reach 200 enchanting, but you’ll want to keep at it until you reach 205. It does turn yellow at 200, so you may need a few more vision dust to top yourself off.

### 205-225

**[Enchant Cloak – Greater Defense](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/13746) x20 (3x Vision Dust)**

Now you’ll be casting your first cloak enchant! Woohoo, it’s finally not a bracer or shield enchant! This one will certainly boost your melee defenses, granting an additional 50 points of armor. Just cast it 20 times until you reach 225, at which point you should head to Annora in Uldaman for the final leg of your training.

225-300 (Artisan)
-----------------

Make sure that you review the notes for the [Enchanting trainer in Uldaman](#plink-uldaman-enchanting-trainer-location) as you’ll want to take as many mats as you can.

Mats Required:

* 10x [Lesser Nether Essence](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11174)
* 70x [Vision Dust](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11137)
* 350x [Dream Dust](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11176)
* 20x [Greater Nether Essence](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11175)
* 40x [Purple Lotus](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/8831)
* 20x [Crystal Vial](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/8925)
* 1x [Arcanite Rod](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/16206)
* 1x [Golden Pearl](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/13926)

* 4x [Small Brilliant Shard](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/14343)
* 2x [Large Brilliant Shard](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/14344)

### 225-235

**[Enchant Gloves – Agility](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/13815) x10 (1x Lesser Nether Essence + 1x Vision Dust)**

You’ll take another break from bracers as you’ll be enchanting gloves this time around. This enchant gives +5 agility, and turns yellow at 230, so you may need a few extra essence and dust to cast the next enchant at 235.

### 235-245

**[Enchant Chest – Superior Health](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/13858) x10 (6x Vision Dust)**

Your next enchant will add 50 health to your chestpiece. It will also turn yellow halfway, so having a surplus of vision dust isn’t a bad idea. You’ll cast this until you finally reach 245 enchanting.

**Important note!  From this point on, all of the enchanting formulas can only be acquired from either a specific vendor, or trainer, or from mobs and the Auction House.  Below each entry will be a short description of where and how to acquire the formula.**

### 245-265

**[Enchant Bracer – Greater Strength](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/13939) x20 (2x Dream Dust + 1x Greater Nether Essence)**

If you felt lost without your bracer enchants, have no fear as they make a final return on this step of the process. You’ll want to cast enchant bracer – greater strength 5 times to reach 250. The +7 boon to strength is no joke, and you’re sure to find eager buyers.

**Location:**  This formula can **only** be acquired from the Master Enchanter **[Annora](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11073).**The other two faction trainers **cannot** train you in this formula.

**Note**

Once AQ launches in Phase 5 a new enchanting trainer will become available. At that time you’ll be able to use [Lesser Mana Oil](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20747) for levels 250-270.  For now though, continue on to the section for 265 – 290.

***[Lesser Mana Oil](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/20747) x20 (3x Dream Dust + 2x Purple Lotus + 1x Crystal Vial)***

*This is your first odd recipe, and will have you create lesser mana oil. This tincture will restore 8 mana every 5 seconds, making it useful for healers. You can purchase this recipe in Silithus from Kania in Cenarion Hold. It will turn yellow at 260, so you’ll likely need extra dust and lotuses. Crystal vials can be found at any alchemy supplies vendor.*

### 265-290

**[Enchant Shield – Greater Stamina](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20017) OR [Enchant Boots – Greater Stamina](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20020) x25 (10x Dream Dust)**

This is the first time you really get an option of which enchant you choose, as both recipes come with the same cost. The key difference is the boots enchant turn yellow at 280, while the shield enchant becomes yellow at 285. Either way, get yourself up to 290 enchanting so you can make your final runed rod!

**Location:**  [Formula: Enchant Shield – Greater Stamina](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/16217) can be purchased from either [Daniel Bartlett](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/4561) in Undercity, or [Mythrin’dir](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/4229) in Teldrassil.  [Formula: Enchant Boots – Greater Stamina](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/16215) is a world drop which can be most easily, if costly, be acquired at the Auction House.  If you wish to farm the formula though, there are an abundance of creatures in the Western Plaguelands from which it drops.

### 290-291

**[Runed Arcanite Rod](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20051) x1 (1x Arcanite Rod + 1x Golden Pearl + 10x Illusion Dust + 4x Greater Eternal Essence + 4x Small Brilliant Shard + 2x Large Brilliant Shard)**

This is your master enchanting rod, and rightfully has an expensive material cost. You’ll need several shards, an arcanite rod, and a golden pearl to make this rod. Put it together and get ready to max your enchanting level!

**Location:** [Formula: Runed Arcanite Rod](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/16243) can **only** be purchased from [Lorelae Wintersong](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/12022) in Nighthaven Village in Moonglade.

### 291-300

**[Enchant Cloak – Superior Defense](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20015) x9 (8x Illusion Dust)**

This is your final enchant and it’s an easy one! Just cast this powerful enchantment providing 70 armor to your cloak 9 times to cap your enchanting level. Congratulations on reaching level 300 enchanting! Keep reading to learn where you can find materials and rare enchantments!

**Location:**  As with the previous formula, [Formula: Enchant Cloak – Superior Defense](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/16224) can **only** be acquired from [Lorelae Wintersong](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/12022) in Nighthaven Village in Moonglade.

If I'm not working or spending time with the family I'm probably gaming. Some of my favorite recent games I've played are Far Cry 5, World of Warcraft Classic, and 7 Days to Die.
