[SoD Blacksmithing Guide](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/season-of-discovery-sod-blacksmithing-guide/)

Blacksmithing is a core crafting profession that is used to create weapons and mail/plate armor. This makes it a popular choice for any melee attackers and more specifically plate armor users like warriors and paladins. You’ll need a lot of materials to get all the way to 300, but the recipes you’ll unlock access to once you get there are well worth it!

To level up your blacksmithing, you’ll primarily need metal bars and stones. Both of these come from [mining](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-mining-guide-1-300/). Whenever you mine a mineral vein, you’ll often receive ore and stone. The ore needs to be smelted into bars before it can be used in blacksmithing recipes.

Blacksmithing is primarily sought after for the strong weapons and armor that you can craft at higher levels. While it does allow you to make some of the strongest weapons in the game (like the [Sulfuron Hammer](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/17193) which is needed to make the legendary [Hand of Ragnaros](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/17182)), it also allows for a few other things that players can benefit from.

Through blacksmithing, a player can create boot spurs, which increase mounted speed. A blacksmith can also create sharpening stones, which will enhance the weapon of a melee attacker. These help to make the profession a staple in the landscape of WoW Classic.

Trainer Locations
-----------------

Finding a trainer for blacksmithing is fairly simple and you’ll only need to leave a major city once you need higher level training. As with any other profession, you can ask any guard in a major city where a specific profession trainer is, and they’ll mark your map with where that trainer is located. For your convenience, Alliance players should train in Ironforge, while Horde players should train in Orgrimmar. Here’s where you can find each level of blacksmithing trainer:

* **Apprentice (1-75) –** Any blacksmithing trainer. For Alliance: Stormwind, Ironforge, or Darnassus. For Horde: Orgrimmar, Undercity, or Thunder Bluff.
* **Journeyman (75-150) –** Keep training where you went previously. That includes any major city again.
* **Expert (150-225) –** At this point, you’ll be required to go to a specific city for expert blacksmithing training. Alliance players will need to train with [Bengus Deepforge](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/4258) in Ironforge, while Horde players need to train with [Saru Steelfury](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3355) in Orgrimmar.
* **Artisan (225-300) –** Both factions will need to leave the comforts of home for the last leg of your training. Fortunately, your trainer isn’t *too* far away. You’ll need to go to Booty Bay and speak with [Brikk Keencraft](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2836) for all of your artisan blacksmithing needs.

Tips and Tricks
---------------

The skill of blacksmithing is fairly straightforward, but there are still a few things you’ll need to keep in mind. These tips aren’t at all requirements, but they will certainly help you reach 300 faster if you take them into consideration.

### Anvil and Hammer

In order to make any blacksmithing recipe, you’ll need a blacksmithing hammer. You can easily purchase this from any blacksmithing vendor. In addition, you’ll need to also by physically located at a blacksmithing anvil. You can find these in several places around Azeroth, but you’ll undoubtedly find them near your blacksmithing trainer.

### Paired Profession

While you can pair any profession with blacksmithing, your best bet is to choose [mining](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-mining-guide-1-300/). Blacksmithing requires the use of smelted bars. Only those with the mining skill have the ability to smelt bars. Furthermore, only miners have the ability to actually collect metal ores for mineral veins throughout the world.This gives you the best opportunity to provide yourself with crafting materials without having to purchase them.

### Armorsmith or Weaponsmith

At higher levels of blacksmithing, you can choose between armorsmithing or weaponsmithing. As their names suggest, armorsmithing focuses on armor while weaponsmithing prioritizes weapons. Both of them do require completion of a quest, but doing so will allow you to make *potentially* less expensive recipes later on.

### Power Crystals

Once you start reaching 260 blacksmithing and above, you’ll notice that many recipes call for the use of some color of power crystal. These power crystals are located in the dinosaur-infested region of Un’Goro Crater. The colors you’ll primarily need are blue and yellow. Fortunately, you **don’t** need to have mining in order to loot these power crystals. You’ll just need to fend off the vicious creatures in the surrounding area!

### Mithril Spurs

Once you reach 235 blacksmithing, the quickest and easiest way to continue leveling is via the [Mithril Spurs recipe](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7989). This is a tradeable recipe, but it is an *extremely* rare world drop. This means that it is often quite expensive, upwards of hundreds of gold on the auction house. If you are fortunate enough to loot one, you’ll be thrilled with the cheap material cost of just 4x [Mithril Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3860) and 3x [Solid Grinding Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7966), which can take you all the way to 275 blacksmithing!

Total Materials You’ll Need
---------------------------

This is a rough idea of the total materials needed to go from 1-300 in blacksmithing. You may need more or less depending upon your skill-up luck, but this should give you a good idea. You’ll swap out some thorium bars for mithril ones if you follow the armorsmith or weaponsmith path, but other than that, you shouldn’t need anything else. Here’s what you’ll need to get to 300 blacksmithing:

* [Silver Bar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2842) – x5
* [Gold Bar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3577) – x5
* [Bronze Bar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2841) – x180
* [Iron Bar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3575) – x200
* [Steel Bar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3859) – x380
* [Mithril Bar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3860)\* – x150
* [Thorium Bar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/12359)\* – x720
* [Rough Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2835) – x170
* [Coarse Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2836) – x160
* [Heavy Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2838) – x180
* [Solid Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7912) – x80
* [Dense Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/12365) – x20
* [Star Ruby](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7910) – x25
* [Green Dye](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2605) – x30
* [Mageweave Cloth](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/4338) – x90
* [Blue Power Crystal](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11184)\* – x60
* [Yellow Power Crystal](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11188) – x20

\* = *If you follow the armorsmith or weaponsmith path, you’ll need 120x less [Thorium Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/12359) and 40x less [Blue Power Crystals](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11184). However, armorsmiths will need 160x more [Mithril Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3860) and 20x [Core of Earth](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7075). Weaponsmiths will need 120x more [Mithril Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3860) and 40x of any combination of [Core of Earth](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7075), [Heart of Fire](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7077), or [Breath of Wind](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7081).*

1-75 (Apprentice)
-----------------

Mats Required:

* [Rough Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2835) – x170
* [Coarse Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2836) – x20

### 1-25

**[Rough Sharpening Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2862) x50 (1x Rough Stone)**

Welcome to your first blacksmithing recipe! This one uses stone. You’ll need to make enough to reach 25 blacksmithing, although it probably won’t take you a full 50 crafts.

### 25-65

**[Rough Grinding Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3470) x60 (2x Rough Stone)**

Once you’ve reached 25 blacksmithing, you get to make… more stone! This time you’ll make rough grinding stones until you hit 65 blacksmithing, which should take less than 60 grinding stones.

### 65-75

**[Coarse Sharpening Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2863) x20 (1x Coarse Stone)**

To cap off the end of your apprentice blacksmithing journey, you’ll make yet another stone recipe, but this time you need coarse stone. Craft coarse sharpening stone until 75, and then pick up journeyman blacksmithing from your trainer.

75-150 (Journeyman)
-------------------

Mats Required:

* [Coarse Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2836) – x80
* [Silver Bar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2842) – x5
* [Rough Grinding Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3470)\* – x10
* [Bronze Bar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2841) – x180
* [Heavy Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2838) – x180

\* = will be crafted during this guide.

### 75-100

**[Coarse Grinding Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3478) x80 (2x Coarse Stone)**

Now you’ll want to make coarse grinding stones. A lot of them to be exact. Your goal is 100 blacksmithing, so it certainly might not take a full 80 stones to get there.

### 100-105

**[Silver Rod](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/6338) x5 (1x Silver Bar + 2x Rough Grinding Stone)**

For the next recipe, you’ll actually make something other than stone! This time you’ll make silver rods, which does require the use of Silver Bars. Consider selling these on the auction house later, as enchanters need these to make special rods.

### 105-125

**[Rough Bronze Leggings](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2865) x30 (6x Bronze Bar)**

Now you get to actually make your first piece of equipment! You’ll want to make a bunch of rough bronze leggings, 30 or so should do the trick. After doing so, feel free to pick up expert blacksmithing.

### 125-150

**[Heavy Grinding Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3486) x60 (3x Heavy Stone)**

If you were missing the stone recipes, don’t fret because you’ll be making one again! At this point you’ve graduated to heavy stone, so make heavy grinding stones until you reach the halfway mark to 300!

150-225 (Expert)
----------------

Mats Required:

* [Gold Bar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3577) – x5
* [Coarse Grinding Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3478)\* – 10x
* [Iron Bar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3575) – x200
* [Heavy Grinding Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3486)\* – x50
* [Green Dye](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2605) – x30
* [Steel Bar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3859) – x240
* [Solid Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7912) – x80
* [Solid Grinding Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7966)\* – x10

\* = will be crafted during this guide.

### 150-155

**[Golden Rod](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11128) x5 (1x Gold Bar + 2x Coarse Grinding Stone)**

Remember the silver rods you made earlier? You’re going to do that again, but this time with gold! Make 5 of these golden bad boys and definitely consider selling these too.

### 155-165

**[Green Iron Leggings](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3842) x10 (8x Iron Bar + 1x Heavy Grinding Stone + 1x Green Dye)**

Who said blacksmithing couldn’t be fashionable? They obviously haven’t seen these green iron leggings! Now you too can make your own pair, or ten! You can find green dye at a tailoring vendor!

### 165-185

**[Green Iron Bracers](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3835) x20 (6x Iron Bar + 1x Green Dye)**

Yes, this fabulous green armor also comes in bracers! Make 20 of them so you can get to 185 blacksmithing, good enough to make your next recipe!

### 185-200

**[Golden Scale Bracers](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/6040) x15 (5x Steel Bar + 2x Heavy Grinding Stone)**

If you thought green looked good, just wait till you see these bracers in gold! You’ll make quite a few of these, but make just enough to get to 200 so you can benefit from the cheaper skill ups coming from solid stone.

### 200-210

**[Solid Grinding Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7966) x20 (4x Solid Stone)**

Now that you’ve reached 200 blacksmithing, you’ll want to switch to solid grinding stone because it is much cheaper. It will go grey at 210, so take full advantage of it until then.

### 210-215

**[Golden Scale Bracers](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/6040) x5 (5x Steel Bar + 2x Heavy Grinding Stone)**

Now you’ll want to go back to to the golden scale bracers so you’re high enough level for the next recipe. 5 of them should be enough to get you there.

### 215-225

**[Steel Plate Helm](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7922) x10 (14x Steel Bar +1x Solid Grinding Stone)**

At this point, you’ll be making steel plate helms! These are actually a popular helm piece, being one of the first plate helm pieces available to classes that wear plate. You’ll make a good number of these, so consider selling them to recoup any losses!

225-300 (Artisan)
-----------------

Mats Required: *These assume you follow the standard path that doesn’t require you to be an armorsmith or weaponsmith.*

* [Steel Bar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3859) – x140
* [Solid Grinding Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7966)\* – x10
* [Mithril Bar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3860) – x150
* [Mageweave Cloth](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/4338) – x90
* [Dense Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/12365) – x20
* [Thorium Bar](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/12359) + 20 for Quest – x700
* [Blue Power Crystal](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11184) – x60
* [Star Ruby](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7910) – x25
* [Yellow Power Crystal](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11188) – x20

*– Armorsmiths and weaponsmiths require 120x less Thorium Bars and 40x less Blue Power Crystals.* 

*– Armorsmiths additionally require 160x more Mithril Bars and 20x Core of Earth.*

*– Weaponsmiths additionally require 120x more Mithril Bars and 40x Core of Earth, Heart of Fire, OR Breath of Wind.*

\* = will be crafted during this guide.

### 225-235

**[Steel Plate Helm](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7922) x10 (14x Steel Bar +1x Solid Grinding Stone)**

Keep making steel plate helms! If it is made of plate, it must do a better job of protecting you right? Nobody really knows, but don’t let that stop you from crafting these plate helms.

### 235-250

**[Mithril Coif](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7931) x15 (10x Mithril Bar + 6x Mageweave Cloth**

*If you have the recipe:* ***[Mithril Spurs](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7989) (4x Mithril Bar + 3x Solid Grinding Stone)\****

If you’re one of the luckier (or richer) players in the game, you can take advantage of the cheap Mithril Spurs recipe. It is a rare world drop that creates [Mithril Spurs](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7969), boot spurs that increase mounted speed. You probably don’t have access to that recipe though, so you can also make mithril coifs. These have a significantly larger material cost, but there isn’t a better alternative if you can’t make the spurs.

### 250-260

**[Dense Sharpening Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/12404) x20 (1x Dense Stone)**

Once you’ve hit 250, you get to make your final stone recipe! Make about 20 dense sharpening stones to make your way to 260 blacksmithing!

### 260-275

**[Thorium Bracers](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/12408) / [Belt](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/12406) x15 (12x Thorium Bar + 4x Blue Power Crystal)**

At this point you’ll start to hit the really expensive part of leveling your blacksmithing. You’ll begin crafting thorium equipment, which requires several thorium bars and power crystals from Un’Goro Crater. You should only need to make 15, after which your skill level should be high enough for the penultimate recipe in this guide!

### 275-295

[**Imperial Plate Bracers**](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/12425) **x20 (20x Thorium Bar + 1x Star Ruby)**

Once you’ve hit 275 blacksmithing, you’ve arrived at a giant wall. You’ll need a whopping 400 Thorium Bars to reach 295, which will take you quite a while to farm. Silithus and Winterspring are great places to farm thorium. Either way, once you have your mountain of thorium, head to Gadgetzan in Tanaris.

Once there, you’ll need to speak with the Thorium Brotherhood representative, [Derotain Mudsipper](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/14567). He’ll give you a simple hand-in entry quest, after which you can obtain quests to unlock Imperial plate armor pieces. The quests themselves are extremely simple, requiring you to hand in thorium bars in exchange for each recipe. The recipe for Imperial Plate Bracers cost 20 Thorium Bars. Don’t forget you’ll also need 20x Star Ruby to make these bracers.

### 295-300

**[Thorium Boots](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/12409) / [Helm](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/12410) x5 (24x Thorium Bar + 1x Star Ruby + 4x Yellow Power Crystal)**

For your final recipe, you’ll make another piece of thorium! This time it’ll cost you an insane 24x Thorium Bars per piece, but fortunately you only need to make 5. Once you’ve collected all your materials, make your boots or helm to reach 300 blacksmithing. Congratulations on your brand new level 300 blacksmithing skill!

Blacksmithing Specialization Quests
-----------------------------------

Once you’ve reached at least 200 in blacksmithing, you now have the option to specialize. Blacksmiths can specialize in either armorsmithing or weaponsmithing. Both specializations do require completion of a quest, so both will be separated into their own section below.

### Armorsmithing Quest Guide

The quest for armorsmithing is very similar to weaponsmithing, but you’ll need to complete a lengthy questline if you wish to craft the needed armor pieces yourself. That questline is the Mithril Order questline, which will be covered below. It should be noted, that while you can technically choose to specialize once you’ve reached a blacksmithing of 200, you must be at at *least* 215 to start the Mithril Order questline.  Unlike weaponsmithing, there are no sub-specialties within armorsmithing.

Here’s what you need to know for the Mithril Order questline and armorsmithing quest:

1. The only main difference between the two factions is the initial quest during the [Mithril Order](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/2760) questline. Everything else is fairly similar, so only that portion will have different instructions depending on faction.
2. If you’re Alliance: Talk to [Hank the Hammer](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/7798) in Stormwind to pick up the quest: [*The Origins of Smithing*](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/2758). The quest isn’t difficult, but you’ll need to come up with 8 [Golden Scale Bracers](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/6040). If you plan on crafting them, this will set you back just 30 [Steel Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3859) and 12 [Solid Grinding Stones](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7966) (yeah, the Alliance have it easier here). After turning them in, you can then pick up the next quest: [*In Search of Galvan*](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/2759). This will send you to [McGavan](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/7794) in Booty Bay.
3. If you’re Horde: Speak to [Aturk the Anvil](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/7792) in Orgrimmar to accept the quest: [*The Old Ways*](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/2756). This quest is very easy, but you’ll need to collect 4 [Steel Breastplates](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7963) and 4 [Steel Plate Helms](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7922) to turn it in. This will cost you 120 [Steel Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3859) and 16 [Solid Grinding Stones](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7966) if you craft them yourself. After handing in the armor, you can pick up the next quest: [*Booty Bay or Bust!*](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/2757) from [Ox](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/7793) nearby. This is very straightforward, requiring you to speak with [McGavan](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/7794) in Booty Bay.
4. At this point, both factions will have spoken to McGavan in Booty Bay. Instructions are identical for both factions now. After turning in the initial quest sending you there, pick up the following quest: [*The Mithril Order*](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/2760). Now you’ll actually need to find [Galvan the Ancient](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/7802), who can be located up north by Zul’Gurub.
5. Upon turning that quest in, you’ll unlock three quests, which all must be completed. Much like the previous quests, these are very simple as well. Instead of handing in armor though, you’ll be handing in metal bars directly. To complete all three quests, you’ll need 120 [Mithril Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3860), 40 [Iron Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3575), 5 [Truesilver Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/6037), and 4 [Citrine](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3864).
6. To complete: [*Smelt On, Smelt Off*](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/2761), you’ll need 40 [Iron Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3575) and 40 [Mithril Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3860).
7. To complete: [*The Art of the Imbue*](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/2763), you’ll need 40 [Mithril Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3860) and 4 [Citrine](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3864).
8. To complete: [*The Great Silver Deceiver*](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/2762), you’ll need 40 [Mithril Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3860) and 5 [Truesilver Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/6037).
9. Once you’ve completed *Smelt On, Smelt Off, The Art of the Imbue, and The Great Silver Deceiver*, you can pick up the next quest: [*Galvan’s Finest Pupil*](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/2764). This will send you to [Trenton Lighthammer](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/7804) in Gadgetzan, Tanaris.
10. After speaking with Trenton, you’ll now unlock another three quests. You’ll need to complete them all, but this is the last set you’ll need to craft all items for the armorsmithing quest!

### Weaponsmithing Quest Guide

One thing that also separates weaponsmithing from armorsmithing is that it is actually made of three subspecialties. These include axesmithing, hammersmithing, and swordsmithing, one for each type of weapon variety. Despite being a unique specialty, picking a specific weapon to specialize in **does not** require completion of a quest (ie, if you want to be an axesmith, you only need to complete the initial weaponsmithing quest).

Here’s the actual requirements for the weaponsmithing quest:

1. The quest is actually very simple, requiring you to hand in 12 weapons to the blacksmithing trainer in your faction’s main city. Unlike the armorsmithing quest, the recipes to make these weapons are easily obtainable without completing a questline.
2. Alliance players will pick their quest up from [Ironus Coldsteel](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11146) in Ironforge, while Horde players get theirs from [Borgosh Corebender](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11178) in Orgrimmar. You’ll need 4 [Moonsteel Broadswords](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3853), 4 [Massive Iron Axes](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3855), 2 [Heavy Mithril Axes](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7941), and 2 [Big Black Maces](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7945).
3. The recipes for Heavy Mithril Axes and Big Black Maces are learned from your blacksmithing trainer, but the other two must be purchased from vendors in Stranglethorn Vale.
   * The recipe for Moonsteel Broadsword is sold by [Zarena Cromwind](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2482) in Booty Bay.
   * The recipe for Massive Iron Axe is sold by [Jaquilina Dramet](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2483) at Nesingwary’s Camp in Stranglethorn Vale.
4. If you plan on crafting all weapons yourself (you can buy them and hand them in instead), you’ll need: 56 [Mithril Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3860), 32 [Steel Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3859), 56 [Iron Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3575), 16 [Gold Bars](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3577), 16 [Heavy Grinding Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3486), 4 [Solid Grinding Stone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7966), 12 [Lesser Moonstone](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/1705), 4 [Citrine](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3864), 2 [Black Pearls](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/7971), 8 [Shadowgems](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/1210), 28 [Heavy Leather](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/4234), 4 [Thick Leather](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/4304), and 16 [Strong Flux](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3466).
5. Whether you craft or purchase them, turn in all 12 weapons to complete your weaponsmithing quest! Congratulations!
