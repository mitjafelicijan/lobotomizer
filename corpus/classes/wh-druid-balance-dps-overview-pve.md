Viability of DPS Balance Druids in WoW Classic PvE Content
----------------------------------------------------------

Balance Druids are viable, but it will not be an easy time. Raids will only accept 1 Balance Druid at most, usually not taking any. While it is not a meta spec, Balance offers a ranged DPS that brings all of the strengths that Druids offer with their toolkit, such as their unique, strong utility. With heavy consumable usage and the willingness to help the raid however it needs it, you can absolutely find a spot in a raid if you are willing to prove yourself and overcome the negative perception.  
  
Balance Druids do provide the strong caster buff while in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_forceofnature.gif) Moonkin Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24858/moonkin-form), but they are very mana and debuff intensive they are in order to deal effective damage, which even then only barely keeps up with the low end.

---

Strengths of Classic Balance Druids
-----------------------------------

#### * Combat Resurrection

Druids can resurrect in combat. They are the only class with the ability to bring a player to back to life during a fight, making them essential to any raid. Warlocks are similar but have to cast their Soulstone preemptively

#### * Strong Off-Healing

Balance druids use many of the same stats that Resto Druids use, while also taking some useful talents for healing such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sentinal.gif) Moonglow](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16845/moonglow) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_naturesblessing.gif) Nature's Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16880/natures-grace). This means that your ability to off-heal is among the strongest of the hybrid classes.

#### * Strong Survivability

With strong defensive tools like [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_stoneclawtotem.gif) Barkskin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22812/barkskin) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_bearform.gif) Dire Bear Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9634/dire-bear-form) combined with the ability to heal, Druids should be among the last to die to most mechanics.

#### * Strong Utility

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_lightning.gif) Innervate](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=29166/innervate) is an incredibly powerful cooldown that is usually reserved for a healer, which can give them a significant boost in mana. Druids also have [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_reincarnation.gif) Rebirth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20748/rebirth), which is one of the only Resurrection abilities that can be used in combat.

---

Weaknesses of Classic Balance Druids
------------------------------------

#### * Low Damage

Simply put, your damage will be low. With perfectly play and optimal consumables/gear you will still end up mid-tier at best.

#### * Mana Problems

You will blow through mana faster than almost any other class and spec, and will struggle heavily during longer fights. Without heavy consumable usage you will usually have major mana problems during raids.

#### * Poor Community Perception

Many hybrid specializations have a poor reputation, but Balance Druids are among the most poorly received for raiding. The spec is perceived by many to be totally nonviable, and that stigma can make it extremely hard to find a guild or raid that will accept you.

Best Races for PvE WoW Classic DPS Balance Druids
-------------------------------------------------

Only two races in WoW Classic can be Druids: [![Night Elf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_nightelf_male.gif) Night Elf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=4/night-elf) for the Alliance and [![Tauren](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_tauren_male.gif) Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren) for the Horde. Therefore you do not have any options when choosing what Druid race is best for PvE or PvP, once you have picked a faction to play.

### Alliance Druid

Druid is one of the lesser-played classes in WoW Classic, and only has one available race per faction. For Alliance, Druids can be [![Night Elf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_nightelf_male.gif) Night Elf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=4/night-elf). Alliance Druids have the benefit of being able to play with [![Paladin](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_paladin.gif) Paladin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=2/paladin), which means access to powerful raid buffs such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofwisdom.gif) Blessing of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25290/blessing-of-wisdom).

#### [Night Elf Night Elf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=4/night-elf) Druid

Night Elfs do not offer any DPS increases as a Druid, but do offer [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Shadowmeld](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20580/shadowmeld), which is incredibly strong in PvP and in the open world. Druids do have access to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Prowl](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9913/prowl) though, which makes Shadowmeld less valuable for Druids since they already have a stealth. Shadowmeld can be useful while leveling though since you can macro it to combine it with eating and drinking to never need to worry about accidentally pulling an unwanted enemy while leveling, and for making it harder for enemy players to catch you while you are vulnerable.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritarmor.gif) Nature Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20583/nature-resistance): Nature Resistance increased by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Wisp Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20585/wisp-spirit): Transform into a wisp upon death, increasing movement speed by 50%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_shadowmeld.gif) Quickness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20582/quickness): Dodge chance increased by 1%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Shadowmeld](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20580/shadowmeld): Activate to slip into the shadows, reducing the chance for enemies to detect your presence. Lasts until cancelled or upon moving. Night Elf Rogues and Druids with Shadowmeld are more difficult to detect while stealthed or prowling.

### Horde Druids

Druid is one of the lesser-played classes in WoW Classic, and only has one available race per faction. For Horde, Druids can be [![Tauren](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_tauren_male.gif) Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren). As a Horde Druid, you will be able to play with [![Shaman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_shaman.gif) Shaman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=7/shaman), which means access to various totems such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_manaregentotem.gif) Mana Spring Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10497/mana-spring-totem), but only if the Shaman is in your party.

#### [Tauren Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren) Druid

While [![Tauren](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_tauren_male.gif) Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren) does not provide any PvE benefits for Balance Druids, they do offer [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warstomp.gif) War Stomp](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20549/war-stomp) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Endurance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20550/endurance). Both of these are great to have for PvP, with War Stomp being especially useful for an emergency stun while melee are on top of you, or for setting up another cast like [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_stranglevines.gif) Entangling Roots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9853/entangling-roots).

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_flower_01.gif) Cultivation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20552/cultivation): Herbalism skill increased by 15.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Endurance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20550/endurance): Total Health increased by 5%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritarmor.gif) Nature Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20551/nature-resistance): Nature Resistance increased by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warstomp.gif) War Stomp](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20549/war-stomp): Stuns up to 5 enemies within 8 yds for 2 sec.

WoW Classic DPS Balance Druid Specializations
---------------------------------------------

There are three specialization talent trees for Classic Druids: Balance (ranged spell DPS), Feral Combat (melee tank and DPS), and Restoration (healing).   
  
Classes in Classic WoW will earn a total of 51 talent points, allowing them to take talents from multiple trees, though most builds typically invest the majority of their points in one tree, while taking only select bonuses in the others. Druid talents are versatile, providing several benefits for other trees, encouraging cross-specializing, and there are several viable talent combinations, depending on whether the player is interested in PvE or PvP.   
  
 **Balance:** Druids can take on the form of a wild moonkin to blast enemies from afar.

* [Moonglow builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/healer-talent-builds-pve#moonglow) hybridize Balance and Restoration in order to provide mana efficiency, but can also deal moderate damage from range as well, however Balance Druids are not seen as overly competitive in Classic, as they are both mana intensive and utilize limited debuff slots.

 **Feral:** Druids can take on the form of a durable bear or savage cat in order to claw and bite their enemies up close.

* [Feral Combat builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/feral/dps-talent-builds-pve#standard-feral-cat-dps) specialize in utilizing Cat Form for dealing damage, while also lowering the armor of their targets and increasing the critical strike chance of their group members. It is typically the go-to leveling spec, due to the increased damage and movement speed, as well as many of the talents benefitting tanking.

 **Bear:** Feral Druids specializing in tanking

* [Feral Tank builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/feral/tank-talent-builds-pve#dedicated-bear-tank) trade damage potential for increased mitigation, while still providing the same utility in reducing their targets armor and increasing their group members critical strike chance. A slightly tweaked [hybridized damage oriented build](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/feral/tank-talent-builds-pve#bear-tank-with-cat-hybrid-talents) also exists for dedicated off-tanks who spend more time in Cat Form.

 **Restoration:** By calling upon the powers of nature, druids are able to swiftly restore health to their injured allies.

* [Swiftmend builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/healer-talent-builds-pve#swiftmend) are often dedicated tank healers, specializing in consuming healing over time effects for a large burst of healing. [Moonglow builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/healer-talent-builds-pve#moonglow) are more mana efficient, making them stronger for early raiding.

### Best Builds for Classic Balance Druids

DPS Balance Druids will spend most of their points in the Balance tree, with some support talents in the Restoration tree.   
  
Viable end-game PvE builds are covered in our [Classic DPS Balance Druid Talents & Builds Guide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/balance/dps-talent-builds-pve).

Best Professions for Classic Balance Druids
-------------------------------------------

Unlike in other versions of WoW, professions in Classic do not offer any direct combat benefits, with the exception of Engineering. For the most part, you should choose professions that you enjoy, or perhaps even more importantly, will make you gold. Gold is an incredibly important part of Classic due to the many important and expensive purchases that you will need to make, such as epic riding, gear, and consumables such as potions for raiding and PvP. Most professions can help you make gold in some way, but gathering professions such as Mining, Herbalism, and Skinning are always great choices. Alchemy can also be an excellent choice early since potions and elixirs will be highly desirable for early raids, and you can transmute [![Arcanite Bar](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_stonetablet_05.gif) Arcanite Bar](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12360/arcanite-bar) on cooldown for an easy revenue source.

### [Herbalism](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/herbalism-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

[![Herbalism](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Herbalism](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=182/herbalism) is a lucrative profession and needed to provide materials for alchemists in order to supply a raid team with consumables. Since other classes are forced into professions to optimize their gear, Druids tend to pick up [![Herbalism](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Herbalism](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=182/herbalism) simply to help out the guild. As an added perk, Druids can pick herbs while in shapeshift forms such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_travelform.gif) Travel Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=783/travel-form).

### [Alchemy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/alchemy-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

[![Alchemy](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Alchemy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=171/alchemy) pairs well with [![Herbalism](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Herbalism](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=182/herbalism) and since Druids aren’t tied to a specific profession like other classes, they can easily pick up [![Alchemy](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Alchemy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=171/alchemy) to help out with crafting consumables for the raid.

### [Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

[Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic) is most commonly picked as a profession in Classic due to its wide variety of powerful items such as [![Iron Grenade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_08.gif) Iron Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4390/iron-grenade), [![Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_49.gif) Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10588/goblin-rocket-helmet), [![Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_polymorphchicken.gif) Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10725/gnomish-battle-chicken), and [![Goblin Sapper Charge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Sapper Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge). If you're trying to min/max your performance in both PvP and PvE, you'll likely need to pick up this profession.
