*The priest is a spellcaster with a diverse portfolio of spells. This class has the most potent healing spells, as well as excellent buffs. It also has good defensive spells that can ward allies from physical dangers and spells, as well as purely offensive shadow spells. However, as a primary spellcaster, the priest is extremely fragile, with poor health and weak melee power.* - World of Warcraft Game Manual, 2004

|  | Shadow Priest are built around two primary Spells,  [Shadowform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15473/shadowform) and  [Shadow Weaving](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15334/shadow-weaving). While in Shadowform, all Shadow Spells cast by the Priest will have increase damage dealt, powerful Spells such as  [Shadow Word: Pain](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10894/shadow-word-pain),  [Mind Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10947/mind-blast), and  [Mind Flay](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18807/mind-flay). While in Shadowform, the Priest can not cast Holy Spells. While most Classes just look at Racial Abilities to decide their preferred Race, Priests have to also take into consideration special *Class specific* Racial Spells. Apparently, each of the Races in Azeroth practice their own Religions, and each Religion has their own Priests that wield unique Spells (Although the [Human Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) and [Dwarf Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) Religions seem to be pretty similar). |

Viability of Shadow Priests in WoW Classic PvE Content
------------------------------------------------------

Shadow [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) will always be asked to respec into Holy, by their Guilds, by their friends, or even by random strangers in Azeroth, and there isn't necessarily anything wrong with that. But there are two types of Shadow Priest out there. One will refuse, that Priest is committed to the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_twilight.gif) Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15259/darkness), not willing to turn their back on it. Others will oblige, telling themselves that they will one day go back down that path, feeling a sense of relief when they slip back into [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_shadowform.gif) Shadowform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15473/shadowform). But the truth is, many won't go back. Many Priests who had dreams of melting faces as Shadow will stay Holy, forever. And there is nothing sadder than that.  
  
At the end of the day, only one lucky [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) will get to raid as Shadow in their Guild, providing [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_blackplague.gif) Shadow Weaving](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15334/shadow-weaving) which boosts Warlock damage by a significant amount. While it is not much of an honor to be that Priest, (You will have the least amount of responsibility in the raid, after all), it can still be a rewarding experience. This guide's goal is to help Shadow Priests understand every intricate detail of their role, gearing up, and what to look out for, to best prepare them to do even more than what is expected.

Strengths of Classic DPS Shadow Priests
---------------------------------------

#### * Extremely powerful Solo PvP Class, known for "melting faces"

With incredibly strong Spells such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_psychicscream.gif) Psychic Scream](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10890/psychic-scream), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_dispelmagic.gif) Dispel Magic](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=988/dispel-magic) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_impphaseshift.gif) Silence](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15487/silence), Shadow [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) are very formidable in World PvP or even controlled Duel situations. Shadow Priests are also one of the most difficult Classes to kill, with so much self-healing taking place from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unsummonbuilding.gif) Vampiric Embrace](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15286/vampiric-embrace), which triggers off of every Tick of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_shadowwordpain.gif) Shadow Word: Pain](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10894/shadow-word-pain), as well as a flat damage reduction built in to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_shadowform.gif) Shadowform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15473/shadowform), and who can forget the astonishing [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_powerwordshield.gif) Power Word: Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10901/power-word-shield), the absolute bane of a [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior)'s existence (*Warriors do not gain any Rage when hitting into a Power Word: Shield*).

#### * Guaranteed PvE Raiding Spot, only one is brought to Raids

As previously mentioned, a Shadow [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) always has a single slot in a 40-man Raid, because of the powerful Debuff [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_blackplague.gif) Shadow Weaving](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15334/shadow-weaving). Since only a single Shadow Priest is brought to a Raid, thankfully the Shadow Priest won't have to compete with other Shadow Priests for gear, but it is important to understand there isn't any Shadow Priest specific gear. A general recommendation is for a Shadow Priest to explain to their Guild when specific items drop in Phase 1, 2 or 3, that these items are Best in Slot for the rest of Classic. Items such as [![Choker of the Fire Lord](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_amulet_05.gif) Choker of the Fire Lord](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18814/choker-of-the-fire-lord), [![Snowblind Shoes](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_cloth_14.gif) Snowblind Shoes](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19131/snowblind-shoes), [![Fel Infused Leggings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_06.gif) Fel Infused Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19133/fel-infused-leggings), [![Firemaw's Clutch](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_10.gif) Firemaw's Clutch](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19400/firemaws-clutch), or [![Neltharion's Tear](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_stone_15.gif) Neltharion's Tear](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19379/neltharions-tear). These items will last all the way through the end of Naxxramas, never being replaced for a Shadow Priest. Just don't expect to be the first one in the Guild to get these items.

#### * Does not need much gear to fulfill their role in a PvE Raid

As you can imagine, if Shadow [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) are only brought to Raids for their Debuff [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_blackplague.gif) Shadow Weaving](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15334/shadow-weaving), it doesn't require much gear to fulfill your role. Thankfully no one should be expecting a Shadow Priest to pull crazy damage meter logs and they won't be complaining when you are bottom of the DPS Chart (*They will, however, make fun of any Raid member below the Shadow Priest*). Because Damage is not a priority, a Shadow Priest can instead focus on what really matters, MP5! But that will, of course, change later into the Phases, when much more powerful gear is dropping, and Bosses are getting more challenging to kill.

---

Weaknesses of Classic DPS Shadow Priests
----------------------------------------

#### * Very Mana intensive Class, heavily relies on Consumables

Because Shadow [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) run out of Mana so quickly and so often, Consumables such as [![Major Mana Potion](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_76.gif) Major Mana Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13444/major-mana-potion), [![Dark Rune](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_sealofkings.gif) Dark Rune](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20520/dark-rune), [![Demonic Rune](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_rune_04.gif) Demonic Rune](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12662/demonic-rune), and [![Night Dragon's Breath](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_food_45.gif) Night Dragon's Breath](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11952/night-dragons-breath) are must have consumables brought to every Raid. For the Shadow Priest looking for an extra edge, they could focus on getting other Consumables such as [![Mageblood Potion](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_45.gif) Mageblood Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20007/mageblood-potion), which is very inexpensive, [![Lesser Mana Oil](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_99.gif) Lesser Mana Oil](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20747/lesser-mana-oil), or even [![Nightfin Soup](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_drink_17.gif) Nightfin Soup](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13931/nightfin-soup). With plenty of Consumables, a watchful eye from the Shadow Priest, or even a friendly [![Druid](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_druid.gif) Druid](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=11/druid) to toss an [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_lightning.gif) Innervate](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=29166/innervate) in a pinch, the Shadow Priest's biggest weakness can be overcome!

#### * Competes for gear with many other Classes and has lowest priority in a PvE Raid

Even though there is only one [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) in the Raid, almost every Damage related piece of gear that Shadow Priest will be rolling on are likely to be rolled on by multiple [![Warlock](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warlock.gif) Warlock](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=9/warlock) or [![Mage](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_mage.gif) Mage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=8/mage), and nearly every MP5 piece of gear will be rolled on by multiple Holy [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest), Restoration [![Shaman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_shaman.gif) Shaman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=7/shaman), or Holy [![Paladin](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_paladin.gif) Paladin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=2/paladin). Furthermore, because a Shadow Priest's role is not gear dependent (apply [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_blackplague.gif) Shadow Weaving](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15334/shadow-weaving)), Shadow Priests are typically the last one to get specific items, making it one of the least rewarding Raiding classes.

#### * Your Guild will likely not want you to play Shadow, preferring you to Heal instead

Because only a single Shadow [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) is brought to Raids, it is an often occurrence that a Guild will ask if their Priests are wanting to play Shadow to re-spec into Holy, and be a Healer in Raids. While it is unfortunate that this happens to many aspiring Shadow [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest), this is actually the best outcome for a Guild and for that individual Priest. Holy Priests will likely find many more Raid opportunities, and there is nothing wrong with choosing that path. You can undoubtedly find a Shadow Priest set of gear, even while Raiding as Holy! And in some ways, this can be reasonably satisfying for Roleplaying purposes, like a good Priest wanting to be a Righteous and Holy contributing member of a Raid, while secretly stashing a passion for evil and Shadowy powers, in his backpack, slowly being corrupted to the dark side!

Best Races for PvE WoW DPS Shadow Priests
-----------------------------------------

In total, there are *five* playable Priest races in WoW Classic — three Alliance and two Horde. Each race has two innate racial abilities which, depending on how you plan to play your character, can be an important part of character creation. Some races have more beneficial abilities in PvE encounters like dungeons and raids, while others are better suited to PvP environments.

### Priest Exclusive Racials

In addition to their other utility, Priests have access to two extra spells depending on their race, which can greatly impact the decision as to which race to play. Both priest racials are learned from your race's capital city, one at level 10, and another at level 20, in addition to the race's normal racials.   
  
A walkthrough of the racial quests is provided in the [Priest Class Quest Guide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/priest-class-quests-classic-wow).

### Best Race for Alliance DPS Shadow Priests

Alliance Shadow [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) have the benefit of Raiding with a [![Paladin](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_paladin.gif) Paladin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=2/paladin), which can Buff the Priest with the insanely beneficial [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofwisdom.gif) Blessing of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25290/blessing-of-wisdom)! With the debuff limit removed, Paladins are also very likely to maintain high uptime on [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousnessaura.gif) Judgement of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20355/judgement-of-wisdom), providing a very large Mana boost for everyone. As previously mentioned, Shadow Priests have severe issues with Mana, and these two spells can go a long way for helping with that. A Paladin also uses various Auras, giving a buff to all party members, such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_mindsooth.gif) Concentration Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19746/concentration-aura), which can help a Shadow Priest when dealing with Trash pulls gone wrong, or Adds that spawn during a Boss fight.  
  
[![Dwarf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_dwarf_male.gif) Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) are the best WoW Classic Alliance race for DPS Shadow Priests.

#### [Human Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) Priest

Humans are a fairly uncommon choice for Shadow [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest). [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_ritualofsacrifice.gif) Feedback](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19275/feedback) is such a strange Racial, because Priest already has access to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_manaburn.gif) Mana Burn](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10876/mana-burn). Human is much better as Holy Priests, taking advantage of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_shardbrilliantsmall.gif) The Human Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20598/the-human-spirit), because Holy Gear will often have much more Spirit on it, furthering the benefit of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Meditation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=14777/meditation). Even then, Humans are always going to be outshined by the [![Dwarf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_dwarf_male.gif) Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf), which have access to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_excorcism.gif) Fear Ward](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=6346/fear-ward), the best Alliance Priest Racial.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_note_02.gif) Diplomacy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20599/diplomacy): Reputation gains increased by 10%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_05.gif) Mace Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20864/mace-specialization): Skill with Maces and Two-Handed Maces increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20600/perception): Dramatically increases stealth detection for 20 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_meleedamage.gif) Sword Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20597/sword-specialization): Skill with Swords and Two-Handed Swords increased by 5.

Human [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) Spells: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_restoration.gif) Desperate Prayer](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19243/desperate-prayer) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_ritualofsacrifice.gif) Feedback](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19275/feedback)

#### [Dwarf Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) Priest

Dwarves are the best [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) Race for  Alliance, period. Regarding PvE or PvP, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_excorcism.gif) Fear Ward](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=6346/fear-ward) is just too insanely powerful. When it comes to Shadow Priest, however, it can be a bit tricky, because Fear Ward is a Holy Spell, which means you can not cast it while in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_shadowform.gif) Shadowform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15473/shadowform). But even after taking this into consideration, it is still too good to pass up. The Dwarf Priest will put Fear Ward on themselves, and in the event of a big Fear in a Raid or Battleground, the Fear will be Resisted, and then the Priest can use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_dispelmagic.gif) Dispel Magic](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=988/dispel-magic) on their allies, removing their Fears. With only a 30 second cooldown, it's up pretty much all the time!

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_dwarf_findtreasure.gif) Find Treasure](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2481/find-treasure): Allows the dwarf to sense nearby treasure, making it appear on the minimap
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_wizardmark.gif) Frost Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20596/frost-resistance): Increases Frost Resistance by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_musket_03.gif) Gun Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20595/gun-specialization): Guns skill increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform): While active, grants immunity to Bleed, Poison, and Disease effects. In addition, Armor increased by 10%. Lasts 8 sec.

Dwarf [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) Spells: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_restoration.gif) Desperate Prayer](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19243/desperate-prayer) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_excorcism.gif) Fear Ward](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=6346/fear-ward)

#### [Night Elf Night Elf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=4/night-elf) Priest

Night Elf is a pretty good PvP Shadow [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) Race, definitely better than Humans. Because of how often a Shadow Priest will run out of Mana, having a strong Racial such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Shadowmeld](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20580/shadowmeld) will enable a Priest to drop down and drink Mana, without the enemy Players even seeing it. Unfortunately, the Class Racials are kind of useless, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_elunesgrace.gif) Elune's Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19293/elunes-grace) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_arcane_starfire.gif) Starshards](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19305/starshards) don't do much for the Shadow Priest. With the standard 5% base chance of Dodging, Elune's Grace only increases it to 15%, meaning you won't Dodge much!

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritarmor.gif) Nature Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20583/nature-resistance): Nature Resistance increased by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Wisp Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20585/wisp-spirit): Transform into a wisp upon death, increasing movement speed by 50%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_shadowmeld.gif) Quickness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20582/quickness): Dodge chance increased by 1%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Shadowmeld](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20580/shadowmeld): Activate to slip into the shadows, reducing the chance for enemies to detect your presence. Lasts until cancelled or upon moving. Night Elf Rogues and Druids with Shadowmeld are more difficult to detect while stealthed or prowling.

### Best Race for Horde DPS Shadow Priests

Horde Shadow [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) will be Raiding with Restoration [![Shaman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_shaman.gif) Shaman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=7/shaman), which have [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_summonwaterelemental.gif) Mana Tide Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17359/mana-tide-totem), an extremely beneficial Totem for Shadow Priests, who have serious Mana issues. When Mana Tide is on cooldown, the Shaman can also use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_manaregentotem.gif) Mana Spring Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10497/mana-spring-totem), which is a much weaker version, yet still beneficial to the Shadow Priest. After the Shaman takes [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_manaregentotem.gif) Restorative Totems](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16208/restorative-totems), Mana Spring will generate 750 Mana over one minute, which isn't that bad.  
  
[![Undead](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_scourge_male.gif) Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) are the best WoW Classic Horde race for DPS Shadow Priests.

#### [Undead Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) Priest

Undead are the best [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) for Horde, hands down. They essentially have a longer cooldown [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_excorcism.gif) Fear Ward](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=6346/fear-ward) built into their base Racials, with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_raisedead.gif) Will of the Forsaken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=7744/will-of-the-forsaken). After the Undead Priest uses Will of the Forsaken, they can then [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_dispelmagic.gif) Dispel Magic](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=988/dispel-magic) on their allies, removing their Fear Debuffs. Don't forget [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_blackplague.gif) Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19280/devouring-plague), an insane Damage over time ability. Unfortunately, Undead Priests will struggle to find good use for this in PvE, because of the massive Mana cost and absurd Threat that comes from it. In PvP however, Devouring Plague is unbelievably powerful, even though it costs nearly 1,000 Mana on its own! But don't worry, the Undead Priest will probably just [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_windwalkon.gif) Inner Focus](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=14751/inner-focus) first!

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_cannibalize.gif) Cannibalize](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20577/cannibalize): When activated, regenerates 7% of total health every 2 sec for 10 sec. Only works on Humanoid or Undead corpses within 5 yds. Any movement, action, or damage taken while Cannibalizing will cancel the effect.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_detectinvisibility.gif) Shadow Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20579/shadow-resistance): Shadow Resistance increased by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_demonbreath.gif) Underwater Breathing](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=5227/underwater-breathing): Underwater breath lasts 300% longer than normal.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_raisedead.gif) Will of the Forsaken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=7744/will-of-the-forsaken): Provides immunity to Charm, Fear and Sleep while active. May also be used while already afflicted by Charm, Fear or Sleep. Lasts 5 sec.

Undead [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) Spells: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_deadofnight.gif) Touch of Weakness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19266/touch-of-weakness) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_blackplague.gif) Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19280/devouring-plague)

#### [Troll Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) Priest

Trolls are just unfairly treated when it comes to [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) Racials. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_fingerofdeath.gif) Hex of Weakness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25816/hex-of-weakness) is one hundred percent worse than the Undead's [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_deadofnight.gif) Touch of Weakness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19266/touch-of-weakness). Hex costs more Mana and does not do damage when it triggers. Even though [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_lightningshield.gif) Shadowguard](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19312/shadowguard) does do damage when the Troll is attacked, it only does 50 more damage than Touch of Weakness! It is important to remember, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_lightningshield.gif) Shadowguard](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19312/shadowguard) can trigger [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_gathershadows.gif) Blackout](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15326/blackout), which is pretty handy in PvP situations. To make matters worse, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_troll_berserk.gif) Berserking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20554/berserking) doesn't really do anything for a Shadow Priest, since the only Casted Spell is [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholyfrenzy.gif) Mind Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10947/mind-blast), which has a cooldown!

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pelt_bear_ruin_02.gif) Beast Slaying](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20557/beast-slaying): Damage dealt versus Beasts increased by 5%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_troll_berserk.gif) Berserking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20554/berserking): Increases your casting and attack speed by 10% to 30%. At full health, the speed increase is 10% with a greater effect up to 30% if you are badly hurt when you activate Berserking. Lasts 10 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_bow_12.gif) Bow Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=26290/bow-specialization): Skill with Bow Weapons increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_regenerate.gif) Regeneration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20555/regeneration): Health regeneration rate increased by 10%. 10% of total Health regeneration may continue during combat.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_throwingaxe_03.gif) Throwing Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20558/throwing-specialization): Skill with Throwing Weapons increased by 5.

WoW Classic DPS Shadow Priest Specializations
---------------------------------------------

Priests are one of the most versatile and sought after casters, widely regarded as the premier healer, and one of the most formidable PvP classes.   
  
There are three specialization talent trees for Classic Priests: Discipline and Holy are healing-focused, while Shadow is DPS-focused.  
  
 **Discipline:** Uses magic to shield allies from taking damage as well as heal their wounds.

* [Power Infusion builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/priest/healer-talent-builds-pve#power-infusion-31-20-0) focus more on boosting raid performance at the expense of the Priest's own healing, placing Power Infusion on their highest DPS ally.

 **Holy:** A versatile healer who can reverse damage on individuals or groups and even heal from beyond the grave.

* [Spiritual Healing builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/priest/healer-talent-builds-pve#classic-holy-21-30-0) are the most common all-purpose healing specializations, which eschew the difficult to use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_summonlightwell.gif) Lightwell](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=724/lightwell) in order to free up talent points for increased flexibility. The build can choose between investing more points in Holy for greater healing output, or keeping points in Discipline to greatly increase mana efficiency.

 **Shadow:** Uses sinister Shadow magic, especially damage-over-time spells, to eradicate enemies.

* [Shadowform builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/priest/shadow/dps-talent-builds-pve#shadow-pve-raiding) enable the Priests true DPS playstyle, which can be very strong, but is also extremely mana and threat intensive, which can be severely limiting in PvE encounters. Despite this, there is always at least one Shadow Priest in any raid in order to debuff the target with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_blackplague.gif) Shadow Weaving](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15334/shadow-weaving). In PvP, Shadow Priests are extremely formidable, largely due to the wide array of offensive and defensive utility.

### Best Builds for Shadow Priests

A Classic Shadow Priest in raids will usually spec 16/0/35 to pick up [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_shadowform.gif) Shadowform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15473/shadowform) as well as 4/5 [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholyfrenzy.gif) Improved Mind Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15314/improved-mind-blast).  
  
Viable end-game PvE builds are covered in our [Classic DPS Shadow Priest Talents & Builds Guide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/priest/shadow/dps-talent-builds-pve).

Best Professions for Classic DPS Shadow Priests
-----------------------------------------------

### [Tailoring](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/tailoring-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Tailoring can be incredibly helpful while leveling, as well as providing you with some fantastic gear for Shadow, that will likely last you through Phase 1 and then some. The true benefit of Tailoring comes in Phase 4, with the release of [Zul'Gurub](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=1977/zulgurub), which adds [Bloodvine Garb](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=421/bloodvine-garb) to Tailoring. This set provides 4% hit total across its 3 pieces, but there is also a set bonus, that while fairly small for Shadow Priests, is still a damage increase on gear that you will likely be wearing anyway. Wearing the gear does not require Tailoring, but the set bonus does.

### [Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Engineering is almost a mandatory profession for every Class in Classic, providing incredible utility items such as [![Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_04.gif) Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18638/hyper-radiant-flame-reflector) and [![Dimensional Ripper - Everlook](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_07.gif) Dimensional Ripper - Everlook](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18984/dimensional-ripper-everlook), as well as various explosives such as [![Thorium Grenade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_08.gif) Thorium Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=15993/thorium-grenade), which can be a life saver in plenty of situations, especially PvP, but also can provide a quick AoE option that doesn't cost mana. [![Goblin Sapper Charge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Sapper Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge) is also one of the most important tools for an Engineer, giving an instant AoE explosion, dealing significant damage as well as some self damage. An entire raid using [![Goblin Sapper Charge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Sapper Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge) at once can completely wipe an enemy raid, or clear an entire AoE pack.

### [Alchemy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/alchemy-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

As already mentioned, Mana is a serious problem for Shadow [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest)s. Early on, when a Priest starts doing Raids, they can use Alchemy to craft powerful Flasks such as [![Flask of Distilled Wisdom](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_97.gif) Flask of Distilled Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13511/flask-of-distilled-wisdom) and [![Flask of Supreme Power](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_41.gif) Flask of Supreme Power](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13512/flask-of-supreme-power). It is generally recommended a Priest uses Distilled Wisdom until they can manage Raids without running out of Mana too early on bosses. Alchemy also gives the Priest access to create their own [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_45.gif) Mageblood Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24365/mageblood-potion), giving them 12 MP5 for an entire Hour. As for Elixirs, it would be a good idea for a Shadow Priest to use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_46.gif) Elixir of Shadow Power](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11476/elixir-of-shadow-power), boosting their Shadow Damage 40.  
  
While it is not mandatory, Alchemy is a great way to make gold and empower a Shadow Priest to farm their Potions, especially when Alchemy is paired with [![Herbalism](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Herbalism](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=182/herbalism). As for a second Profession, it is entirely optional, as is [![Alchemy](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Alchemy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=171/alchemy). For PvP Shadow Priests, it is always recommended you take [Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic), which will open up access to powerful tools such as [![Thorium Grenade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_08.gif) Thorium Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=15993/thorium-grenade) and [![Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_49.gif) Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10588/goblin-rocket-helmet)!

Shadow Priest Class Mechanics
-----------------------------

### Mana

*Mana is what you pay to cast your spells if your class has any spellcasting capability. These classes are mages, priests, warlocks, druids, shaman, paladins, and hunters. The spells of these classes have mana costs that must be paid in order to be cast. The amount of mana you have is set by your class, with primary spellcasters, like priests and mages, getting more than hybrid spellcasters, such as druids and shaman. Classes that are even less reliant on spells, such as hunters and paladins, have even less mana. In addition, your character’s intellect gives you a bonus to mana. Each class gets a different amount of bonus mana, with primary spellcasters getting more for each point of intellect than other spellcasters. Your mana is displayed as a blue bar next to your character portrait.* - World of Warcraft Game Manual, 2004

Mana is the primary resource for a [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest). As a Shadow Priest, you will be gobbling up all of your Mana, all the time. Many Spells that do Damage, as well as Spells that are useful tools for survival, have very high Mana costs. The Mana issue for Shadow Priests is especially dire when compared to other Spellcasters such as [![Mage](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_mage.gif) Mage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=8/mage) and [![Warlock](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warlock.gif) Warlock](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=9/warlock), who both have their own Spells for acquiring more Mana, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_purge.gif) Evocation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12051/evocation) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_burningspirit.gif) Life Tap](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11689/life-tap). Priests, however, have a single Talent, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_windwalkon.gif) Inner Focus](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=14751/inner-focus), which only applies to a single Spell. For this reason, Shadow Priests are one of the most consumable heavy classes, relying on Mana Potions and the like to stay in a fight!  
  
But there is an added benefit to this issue. Gearing a Shadow Priest can be relatively simple, Equip Bonuses such as "Equip: Restores 11 mana per 5 sec.", from [![Mindtap Talisman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_battery_02.gif) Mindtap Talisman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18371/mindtap-talisman), is an Equip Bonus also known as "MP5". MP5 is the only way a Shadow [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) can gain Mana while in combat, meaning while casting Spells, during combat. This is one of the primary Stat Bonuses a Shadow [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) should look out for on Gear.  
  
The 5-second rule applies after a Player has not cast a Spell for 5 seconds, then that player will begin to accrue Mana, from Spirit. One thing to understand is that Spirit does not have any in-combat benefits for a Shadow [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) unless that Priest picks up the Talent [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Meditation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=14777/meditation), which allows the Priest to harness 15% of their Mana Regeneration from Spirit, while casting [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_siphonmana.gif) Mind Flay](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18807/mind-flay) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholyfrenzy.gif) Mind Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10947/mind-blast). It can be really easy to mix up how MP5, Spirit, and Meditation works, but a general rule of thumb is this; MP5 is most essential and should be stacked up as much as possible!

### Spell Coefficient

On many items, Players will see an Equip Bonus such as, "Equip: Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 30." This Equip Bonus is from [![Crimson Felt Hat](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_51.gif) Crimson Felt Hat](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18727/crimson-felt-hat). Players have often misunderstood the wording, specifically "up to," thinking there is a chance the benefit changes from Spell to Spell. What this minor wording is referring to, is the *Spell Coefficient*.  
  
Mainly, not all Spells are created equal. Some Spells will gain the full bonus from [![Crimson Felt Hat](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_51.gif) Crimson Felt Hat](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18727/crimson-felt-hat), whereas other Spells might only gain half of it. The way it is calculated is based on Cast times, Duration, as well as added effects to the Spells. Below are a list of formulas, as well as the Spell Coefficient for various Shadow Priest Spells.

#### Cast Spells

```
[Cast Time] / 3.5 = [Coefficient]  
- Up to a maximum of 200%  
- Instant cast spells are considered 1.5 second cast times
```

#### Damage Over Time Spells

```
[Duration] / 15 = [Coefficient]  
- Damage Over Time Spells that last longer than 15 Seconds are reduced to 15  
- Spell Damage Gains is divided equally among Ticks  
- If there is a Healing effect, multiply Coefficient by 0.5
```

#### Channeled Spells

```
[Channel Time] / 3.5 = [Coefficient]  
- If there is a Snare effect, multiply Coefficient by 0.95
```

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| * [Mind Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10947/mind-blast) | * ```   (1.5) / 3.5 = 0.4285   ``` | * 42.85% Spell Coefficient |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| * [Shadow Word: Pain](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10894/shadow-word-pain) \* | * ```   (15) / 15 = 1 1 / 6 = 16.6667   ``` | * 100% Spell Coefficient 16.66% Spell Coefficient per Tick |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| * [Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19280/devouring-plague) | * ```   ((15) / 15) * 0.5 = 0.5 0.5 / 8 = 0.0625   ``` | * 50% Spell Coefficient 6.25% Spell Coefficient per Tick |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| * [Mind Flay](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18807/mind-flay) | * ```   ((3) / 3.5) * 0.95 = 0.81 0.81 / 3 = 0.27   ``` | * 81% Spell Coefficient 27% Spell Coefficient per Tick |

*\* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_shadowwordpain.gif) Improved Shadow Word: Pain](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15317/improved-shadow-word-pain) does not reduce the Spell Coefficient per Tick. With [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_shadowwordpain.gif) Improved Shadow Word: Pain](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15317/improved-shadow-word-pain), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_shadowwordpain.gif) Shadow Word: Pain](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10894/shadow-word-pain) will last 24 seconds and Tick 8 times. Each Tick will gain the same base Spell Coefficient of 16.66%.*  
  
If a [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) were to have 500 Bonus Spell Damage from Equipped Gear, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholyfrenzy.gif) Mind Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10947/mind-blast) would only benefit from 214 Spell Damage, Each Tick of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_shadowwordpain.gif) Shadow Word: Pain](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10894/shadow-word-pain) would only benefit from 83 Spell Damage, and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_siphonmana.gif) Mind Flay](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18807/mind-flay) would only benefit from 95 Spell Damage per Tick. This is important to understand how damage is calculated and how Spell Damage can directly impact a Shadow Priest's output. But of course, an easy thing to remember from all of this: More Spell Damage is **always** better!
