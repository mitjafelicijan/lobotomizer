# Protection Paladin Tanking Guide - WoW Classic

**Welcome to Askalon's Protection Paladin Tanking guide for WoW Classic (v 1.13)!**

Show Table of Contents

Introduction
------------

The goal of this guide is to provide aspiring paladin tanks a comprehensive introduction towards become a successful tank for the majority of end-game content, including 40-man raids. What I define by success is being able to consistently tank the majority of end-game content such as dungeons and raids at approximately the same level as warrior tanks.  
For those who don't want to read the entire guide, skip to the TL;DR Summary sub-section.**Strengths**

* Massive multi-target threat generation.
* Excellent at tanking large groups of mobs,
* Can tank dungeons more effectively than warrior tanks.
* Extremely high single-target threat generation in raid settings.
* Large set of utility spells for aiding allies (e.g. Auras, Blessings)

**Weaknesses**

* No taunt.
* Limited access to raid-tier tanking gear.
* Almost no abilities available for single-target crowd control,
* No emergency damage mitigation abilities (e.g. Last Stand, Shield Wall)
* Limited mana resource pool for spells and abilities.

**A Brief History of Paladin Tanks:**Historically, the only viable (in terms of all raids and dungeons) tanks in Vanilla were Protection Warriors, with Feral Druids able to serve a similar, but still limited role. For Protection Paladins, their tanking abilities were even more limited, particularly due to the lack of a taunt ability. With the advent of TBC, Protection Paladins gained more tools and abilities that allowed to excel in heroic dungeons and as off-tanks in many raid encounters requiring vast amounts of AoE threat generation, but not yet able to fully replace warrior tanks in MT roles. For WotLK and subsequent expansions, Protection Paladins finally had the tools necessary to be able to compete at the same level and even excel as main tanks compared to other classes.**Topics**This guide will cover the following :

* Talents, Spells, and Abilities
* Spell rotations.
* Recommended Items. equipment, and consumables.
* Strategies for general main tank and off-tank roles.
* Strategies for tanking specific dungeons and raids.

**Disclaimers**Before we get started, some disclaimers to consider before you jump into paladin tanking:

1. Vanilla Prot paladins will generally never be able to fully replace warrior tanks as raid tanks. The paladin tanking toolkit is very limited in scope, particularly for damage mitigation as they lack abilities similar to Shield Wall, Defensive Stance, and other powerful tanking abilities. There are also a few encounters in which taunt rotations are all but necessary.
2. There are extremely few items in Vanilla WoW specifically made for paladin tanking, so paladin tanks will generally have a harder time upgrading their gear compared to warrior tanks, who have raid-tier sets dedicated to tanking.

### TL;DR Summary

For those that don't want to read the entire guide, I have provided a simple and concise outline of the essentials.

**Primary abilities:**

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealoffury.gif) Righteous Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25780/righteous-fury) - Provides a significant bonus to your threat that enables you to maintain aggro. ALWAYS have it active.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_innerfire.gif) Consecration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20924/consecration) - Your main AoE threat ability. Use Rank 5 on pull, then downrank to Rank 1 to save on mana.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_spell_holy_blessingofprotection.gif) Holy Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20928/holy-shield) - Your main damage mitigation ability, also a good source of threat. Use Rank 1 to save on mana.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousnessaura.gif) Seal of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20357/seal-of-wisdom)/[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousnessaura.gif) Judgement of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20355/judgement-of-wisdom) - Your most powerful mana regeneration abilities. With a weapon under 2.00 Speed, you easily maintain approximately 100-175 MP5 during combat while both of these abilities are active.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_thunderbolt.gif) Seal of Righteousness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20293/seal-of-righteousness) - Your primary single-target threat ability for dungeons. Use its [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousfury.gif) Judgement](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20271/judgement) to get a boost in threat.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_greaterblessingofkings.gif) Greater Blessing of Kings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25898/greater-blessing-of-kings) - Your primary single-target threat generation ability for raids. Scales with Righteous Fury and number of players buffed.

**Gearing:**

* Primary stats to go for are Stamina, Armor, Defense, Spell Damage, and MP5.
* A good start would be to go for the [Deathbone Guardian](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=124/deathbone-guardian) set which drops in Scholomance, which provides substantial amounts of Defense and MP5.
* Check the Gearing section for a more comprehensive list of recommended equipment.

**Tips**

* Take advantage of Line of Sight and Positioning to ensure all mobs move to you and land on your Consecrations.
* Try to conserve your mana by downranking your Holy Shield and Consecration once you have aggro on mobs.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofprotection.gif) Blessing of Protection](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10278/blessing-of-protection) (on ally) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofmight.gif) Hammer of Justice](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10308/hammer-of-justice) (on mob) are useful for single-target crowd control if you lose aggro on mobs.

Spells & Abilities
------------------

These are the most useful spells and abilities for paladin tanking.

**Offensive**

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_innerfire.gif) Consecration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20924/consecration) - One of the primary prot paladin abilities. This ability is the primary source of damage and threat generation. This ability excels at generating enough threat to maintain aggro on large groups of enemies.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_holysmite.gif) Seal of the Crusader](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20308/seal-of-the-crusader) - Apply directly to infidels. Using this ability by itself isn't that useful, but the debuff that you apply on enemy using Judgement makes this a great tool in your arsenal for generating large amounts of threat on single targets. Use in sync with other holy abilities such as Seal of Righteousness, Consecrate, and Holy Shield to boost their spellpower bonus.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_thunderbolt.gif) Seal of Righteousness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20293/seal-of-righteousness) - This is great as a buff to keep active to increase threat on targets, especially those with Judgement of the Crusader debuff,. This is also useful to use with Judgement as it can give a nice burst of threat on single targets, acting sort of like a taunt if you lose aggro on a mob.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealoffury.gif) Righteous Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25780/righteous-fury) - One of the primary prot paladin abilities because of the threat bonus it provides for your abilities. Improved Righteous Fury is an absolutely necessary talent to have to improve threat generation.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousfury.gif) Judgement](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20271/judgement)
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterblessingofwisdom.gif) Greater Blessing of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25918/greater-blessing-of-wisdom) - This is a useful buff to use to keep up your mana regeneration to maintain consistent threat generation.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_auraoflight.gif) Retribution Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10301/retribution-aura) - This aura is primarily useful for dealing additional damage and threat to large groups of mobs when tanking trash mobs in dungeons or raids.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_excorcism.gif) Holy Wrath](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10318/holy-wrath) - Skeletons in your closet? Get back at them with this powerful skill that damages all undead around you! Can be potentially useful in Stratholme and Scholomance, however, you are unable to dodge, block or parry whlie casting the spell. Synergizes well with Divine Shield for pala-bombing.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_excorcism_02.gif) Exorcism](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10314/exorcism) - A single target ability effective against the undead that can help you generate large amounts of threat. Useful in Scholomance and Stratholme.

**Defensive**

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_spell_holy_blessingofprotection.gif) Holy Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20928/holy-shield) - One of the primary prot paladin abilities. The +30% Block Chance from the spell gives a significant boost to your damage mitigation, while generating significants amount of threat when enemies are hurt by your blocks.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_devotionaura.gif) Devotion Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10293/devotion-aura) - Provides passive damage mitigation from physical attacks.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterblessingofsanctuary.gif) Greater Blessing of Sanctuary](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25899/greater-blessing-of-sanctuary) - Excellent supplement to Holy Shield. as it further increases your damage mitigation and damage dealt by blocks.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_divineintervention.gif) Divine Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1020/divine-shield) - Bubble boy time! This ability can be useful when you're pulling mobs or bosses that deal lots of damage that may require positioning. It is not recommended to use this during combat as any aggro'd mobs will aggro on the player with the next highest amount of threat.

**Utility/Other**

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofprotection.gif) Blessing of Protection](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10278/blessing-of-protection) - An extremely useful ability for crowd control. Applying Blessing of Protection on a friendly player with aggro of an enemy mob will make them temporarily reaggro on the person with the next highest amount of threat, which should be the tank.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofmight.gif) Hammer of Justice](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10308/hammer-of-justice) - This is a very useful ability to have for crowd control, in case a mob breaks loose and starts attacking your healer or damage dealer. During the stun duration, you can begin building more threat on the mob to try to regain aggro before the stun expires.

Mechanics and Analysis
----------------------

This section provides an in-depth analysis of several protection paladin abilities and mechanics that can be used to optimize your tanking.[**Greater Blessing Spam**](javascript:)

It is well established that damage from Holy spells and abilities are a paladin tank's main source of threat, however, there are additional non-damaging spells available that can also be used for generating additional threat. Examples of such spells that can generate threat are Seals, Blessings, Cleanses, etc.   
  
**As of Phase 5, with the implementation of the Threat API, threat meter addons can now accurately track all threat sources.**   
  
Some of these spells have the potential to become powerful threat generators that can far exceed the threat generation of any other tanking classes, as shown in the following videos:  
  
A notable benefit of utilizing blessing spam is that it can generate threat at long ranges without having to directly attack enemies. In the Onyxia video below, blessing spam is used during Phase 2 of the fight in order to remain high up on the threat table despite being fireballed, thus improving the likelihood of gaining aggro at the start of Phase 3.  
  
**Why does this work?**  
  
The tooltip for **[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealoffury.gif) Righteous Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25780/righteous-fury)** states the following:

*Increases the threat generated by your Holy attacks by 60%. Lasts 30 min.*

In practice, however, Righteous Fury increases the threat of ALL spells in the Holy school, such that it affects the threat generated by blessings, heals, etc. As a result, this vastly improves the threat potential of Protection Paladins, as shown in the two videos linked below.  
  
**On October 28, 2019, Blizzard updated its "Not a Bug" list to include that [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealoffury.gif) Righteous Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25780/righteous-fury) is working as intended.**

*Righteous Fury grants additional threat on all holy abilities, not just attacks.*  
Source: <https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list-updated-10-28-2019/175887/139?u=askalon-pagle>

**Greater Blessing Threat Generation**The rule of thumb for Holy spells such as seals and blessings is that their base threat is equal to the level that the spell can be learnt at. E.g. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_fistofjustice.gif) Blessing of Might](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19838/blessing-of-might) is learnt at Level 52, therfore it generates 52 threat. There may be some spells that are exceptions to this rule, which still have to be tested. Additionally, any threat genereated by Holy spells can be further amplified by [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealoffury.gif) Righteous Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25780/righteous-fury). With the rules out of the way, this is where the threat potential of these spells comes into play.   
  
A unique property of Greater Blessing spells is that the total threat generated by a single cast linearly scales with the number of players who have the buff applied or refreshed. The more players that get buffed by a single cast, the higher the threat will be.  
  
The following table shows threat values associated with different Greater Blessing spells:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Spell** | **Base Threat** | **Mana Cost** | **Total Threat Per Player\*** |
| [Greater Blessing of Kings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25898/greater-blessing-of-kings) | 60 | 150 | 114 |
| [Greater Blessing of Might](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25782/greater-blessing-of-might) (Rank 1) | 52 | 220 | 98.8 |
| [Greater Blessing of Sanctuary](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25899/greater-blessing-of-sanctuary) | 60 | 270 | 114 |
| [Greater Blessing of Light](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25890/greater-blessing-of-light) | 60 | 260 | 114 |
| [Greater Blessing of Salvation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25895/greater-blessing-of-salvation) | 60 | 16% of base mana | 114 |
| [Greater Blessing of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25894/greater-blessing-of-wisdom) (Rank 1) **$** | 0 | 230 | 0 |

*\* Using Improved Righteous Fury, which increases threat generated by all Holy spells by 90%.*  
*$ All Blessing of Wisdom spells generate 0 when cast. Mana regen from BoW does not generate threat either.***Formula for calculating total threat from a single Greater Blessing cast:**  

```
Threat = base_threat * 1.90 * players_buffed  
  
Variables:  
-players_buffed: Number of players for a specific class.  
-base_threat: Base Threat generated of a Greater Blessing spell.  
  
Assumptions:  
-Improved Righteous Fury has been unlocked for 1.90x threat multiplier.
```

![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/19187.png)As shown by the chart, spells such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_greaterblessingofkings.gif) Greater Blessing of Kings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25898/greater-blessing-of-kings) have huge threat potential in scenarios where there are many players of the same class, such as in raids. These spells can be cast repeatedly to generate large quantities of threat within short periods of time. Greater Blessing spam also has many other advantages over the threat generation abilities of other classes:

1. Not subject to partial or binary spell resistances.
2. Cannot be physically avoided.
3. Generates global threat that is split up evenly between any mobs being fought.
4. Can generate threat at long-range.

When using Greater Blessing spam in raids, the recommended blessing to use is [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_greaterblessingofkings.gif) Greater Blessing of Kings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25898/greater-blessing-of-kings) due to it having the lowest mana cost out of all the Greater Blessing spells.

[**Seal of Wisdom - Mana Regeneration & Threat**](javascript:) 

Without mana, Protection Paladins cannot cast abilities necessary to generate threat.  
Paladins have several mana regenaration abilities available to them that can minimize the mana consumption rate of their rotations during dungeon and raid encounters.  
  
[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousnessaura.gif) Seal of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20357/seal-of-wisdom) is the most powerful mana regeneration ability available to paladins, and is comprised of its Seal and Judgement effects.  
  
The Seal portion has the following properties:

* Static PPM. Fixed proc rate of 15 Procs per Minute (PPM) regardless of weapon speed.
* Restores 90 mana when proc is activated.

The Judgement portion has the following properties:

* Dynamic PPM. Flat proc chance of 50% per hit regardless of weapon speed.
* Restores 59 mana when proc is activated.

While the Seal portion is expected to restore a fixed amount of mana per minute, the Judgement portion will vary based on the weapon speed. For the following calculations and charts it is assumed that all your swings will land on a mob and that the mob has no avoidance.  
  
**Formula for Judgement of Wisdom PPM:**  

```
JoW PPM = (1 / weapon_speed) * 0.50 * 60
```

Using the static Seal PPM and the dynamic Judgement PPM, the expected mana regeneration of both effects can be calculated. In the following chart, the approximate MP5 for the separate and combined portions of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousnessaura.gif) Seal of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20357/seal-of-wisdom) for varying weapon speeds are shown:![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/19188.png)  
  
As demonstrated in the chart, the mana regeneration contributions of the Judgment portion of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousnessaura.gif) Seal of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20357/seal-of-wisdom) increases when using faster weapons (lower weapon speed). Although the mana consumption rate of your rotation will very likely exceed the mana regeneration provided by [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousnessaura.gif) Seal of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20357/seal-of-wisdom), at the very least you have a stable source of mana regeneration that will significantly reduce the delay between being out of mana to being able to cast another spell, inreasing your combat effectiveness.  
  
Another added benefit of using [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousnessaura.gif) Seal of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20357/seal-of-wisdom) is that mana restored by the Seal and Judgment effects generate threat. Mana restored by these effects have a threat multiplier of 0.50 which be multiplied further by Righteous Fury's multiplier of 1.90. What this means is that while improved [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealoffury.gif) Righteous Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25780/righteous-fury) is active, any procs from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousnessaura.gif) Seal of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20357/seal-of-wisdom) will generate threat equivalent to 95% of mana restored. You can multiply the MP5 values shown on the chart by 0.95 to get an idea of how much threat will be generated.

[**Holy Shield - Damage Mitigation and Threat Generation**](javascript:)

**[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_spell_holy_blessingofprotection.gif) Holy Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20928/holy-shield) - Damage Mitigation and Threat Generation**  
  
Formula for calculating theoretical maximum damage mitigation from Holy Shield:  

```
Damage Mitigated = (duration * 0.4 )* [ shield_block_value + (Strength / 20) ] * 1.30  
-Variables:   
duration: time length of encounter in seconds.   
shield_block_value: block value contributed by your shield.   
Strength: total strength stat from all sources.  
  
-Assumptions:   
Holy Shield uptime is 100% and all 4 charges consumed per charge cycle.   
Dodge, Miss, Parry, and Block (from equipment) not accounted for.   
Armor damage mitigation not accounted for.   
Shield Specialization talent is maxed out (3/3) for +30% block value.   
  
-Derivation: 1 Holy Shield cycle <=> 10 seconds <=> 4 charges -> 1 block / 2.5 seconds == 0.4 blocks / second
```

Formula for calculating theoretical maximum threat generation from Holy Shield:  

```
Threat per Second = 0.4 * [base_damage + (0.05 * spell_damage)] * 2.10  
-Variables:   
spell_damage: spell damage contributions from equipment and/or buffs. +0.05 coefficient.  
base_damage: base damage dealt by Holy Shield (65, 94, and 129 for Ranks 1, 2, 3, respectively).  
-Assumptions:   
Holy Shield uptime is 100% and all 4 charges consumed per charge cycle.   
Rank 1 Holy Shield being used ( Dodge, Miss, Parry, and Block (from equipment) not accounted for.   
Improved Righteous Fury talent has been maxed out (3/3).   
Righteous Fury is active (+90% threat from Holy spells).   
Righteous Fury and Holy Shield threat bonuses stack ADDITIVELY (90% + 20% = 110%) .
```

Empirical damage mitigation and threat generation contributed by Holy Shield will likely be lower than the theoretical maximums due to the following factors:

* Number of mobs attacking you
* Damage dealt by mobs.

A decent method for estimating more realistic threat generation and damage mitigation is to multiply the theoretical values by the following coefficient:

```
coefficient = 0.33 * number of mobs  
Assuming that when fighting 3 or more mobs, all Holy Shield charges will be consumed per cycle.
```

[**Seal of Righteousness - Mechanics & Damage/Threat Generation**](javascript:)

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_thunderbolt.gif) Seal of Righteousness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20293/seal-of-righteousness) - Mechanics & Damage/Threat Generation**Yellow Hit and Procs:**As indicated by the description of Seal of Righteousness, yellow damage is applied alongside each of your white damage melee auto-attacks while this ability is active. This additional yellow damage has a hidden mechanic such that it acts as an additional hit with regards to being able to activate procs for weapons with permanent 'Chance on Hit' enchantments. The proc rate for 'Chance on Hit' enchantments is dependent upon the weapon speed and a fixed coefficient (varies by enchantment), generally set up such that regardless of weapon speed, the observed procs per minute will be the same. The implication of this additional yellow hit from SoR is that the expected procs per minute is almost doubled.Every time you swing your weapon while SoR is active, there are four possible outcomes with regards to procs:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **White Hit** | **Yellow Hit** |
| **Yes** | **No** |
| **No** | **Yes** |
| **Yes** | **Yes** |
| **No** | **No** |

The probability for a single swing to proc once or twice while SoR is active is the following:  

```
Proc Chance = 1 - ( (1 - P) ^ 2)  
Variables: P = Base Proc Chance (ex: 5% = 0.05)
```

The table below contains examples of items/enchantments that may be affected by this mechanic:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Affected** | **Not Affected** |
| [Flurry Axe Flurry Axe](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=871/flurry-axe) (5.02% Proc Chance w/out SoR) (9.78% Proc Chance w/ SoR)  [Thrash Blade Thrash Blade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17705/thrash-blade) (4.4% Proc Chance w/out SoR) (8.61% Proc Chance w/ SoR)  [Masterwork Stormhammer Masterwork Stormhammer](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12794/masterwork-stormhammer)   [Enchant Weapon - Crusader](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20034/enchant-weapon-crusader)   [Enchant Weapon - Lifestealing](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20032/enchant-weapon-lifestealing)   [Enchant Weapon - Fiery Weapon](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=13898/enchant-weapon-fiery-weapon) | [Shadow Oil Shadow Oil](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=3824/shadow-oil)  [Frost Oil Frost Oil](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=3829/frost-oil) |

**Damage and Threat Generation**Note that for Rank 3 Seal of Righteoussness, the Spellpower coefficient is 0.18, but for subsequent ranks (4 and up), the Spellpower coefficient decreases to 0.10.The formula for calculating the theoretical maximum damage from Seal of Righteousness:  

```
Damage = ( 22.075 * weapon_type_coeff * attack_speed * sor_talent_bonus * one_handed_talent_bonus) + (0.10 * spellpower)  
  
-Variables:  
weapon_type_coeff: 0.85 for 1-Handed weapons; 1.20 for 2-Handed weapons.  
attack_speed: attack speed of your weapon.   
sor_talent_bonus: Improved Seal of Righteousness bonus. Set to 1.15 if maxed out at 5 points; 1.00 if 0 points.  
one_handed_talent_bonus: Applies only if using 1-Handed weapon. Set to 1.10 if maxed out at 5 points; 1.00 if 0 points.   
spellpower: Spell Damage bonus from gear, consumables, buffs, etc..  
  
-Assumptions:   
Player is level 60.   
Max Rank Seal of Righteousness is being used (Rank 8).
```

The table below shows expected damage per hit, DPS, and TPS for SoR at different attack speeds and spellpower.The data assumes the following:

* One Handed Weapon being used.
* 5/5 Improved Seal of Righteousness
* 5/5 One-Handed Weapon Specialization
* 3/3 Improved Righteous Fury
* Global Cooldowns and Parry Haste are not accounted for.

![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/18612.png)The most notable trend in the table is that as spellpower increases, faster weapons are capable of dealing more threat and damage per second compared to slower weapons, despite fast weapons dealing lower damage per hit. This is because the spellpower damage bonus for SoR is calculated independently of the base damage; it is not affected by any variables related to the weapon's attack speed.

Talent Builds
-------------

There is no objective best talent build for protection paladins, but there are several talents to consider putting into your build that will best suit your playstyle.There are different ways to play as a protection paladin tank, with different talent builds better suited to different roles, and their effectiveness may vary depending on your gear. Examples of such roles are dedicated main/off tanking, hybrid healing/tanking in raids, and AoE farming.The four talent builds below are some examples of different talent builds custom-tailored for different scenarios and are there to serve as a stepping stones into helping you decide how you want to customize your own protection paladin talent build.

The intent of this build is to maximize damage mitigation for those who want to exclusively focus on tanking in most situations. Note that 5/5 Improved Devotion Aura provides an increase of approximately 184 armor to Devotion Aura Rank 7 which has a base value of 735 armor. This small armor bonus has diminishing returns as better tanking gear is obtained, making it less useful, so these 5 points can be wild cards for any talent(s) of your choice in the Protection talent tree, such as One-Handed Weapon Specialization.

Essentially a 'Jack of All Trades' builds, the intent of this build is to allow flexibility in switching between healing and off-tanking roles during raids, without sacrificing too many of your healing or tanking capabilities other than deflection. Blessing of Kings is included in this build to provide additional utility to the raid.

Modifiation of the 'Max Mitigation' build with some mitigation talents removed. This build is recommended when you have fairly good tanking gear to compensate for the lack of the bonus defense from Anticipation and bonus armor from Devotion Aura. Note that the more defense you have, the less often you will get Redoubt or Reckoning procs from being critically hit.

The intent of this build is to maximize solo endurance when doing AoE farming on large quantities of mobs, whether it be in the open world or in dungeons. At the very minimum Spiritual Focus is mandatory so that you can heal yourself in combat without interruption while Concentration Aura is active. Blessing of Sanctuary helps mitigation a portion of incoming, and Improved Ret Aura reduces the time it takes to take down mobs. Another option with this build is to reallocate some points from the Retribution tree into Holy talents to improve your self-healing capabilities.

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Divine Intellect](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20261/divine-intellect) - More intellect will increase your total mana pool, allowing you to cast more spells before going OOM.[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_thunderbolt.gif) Improved Seal of Righteousness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20332/improved-seal-of-righteousness) - This is an excellent talent for improving your threat generation when on single targets when using the Seal of Righteousness buff, along with the Judgement of the Crusader.[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_golemthunderclap.gif) Divine Strength](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20266/divine-strength) - Not as recommended over Seal of Righteousness, but the increase in strength would improve your block value by up to 10%.[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_innerfire.gif) Consecration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=26573/consecration) - Unlocks the Consecration ability, one of the primary paladin tank spells.

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_defend.gif) Redoubt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20137/redoubt) - 5/5 points required to unlock Shield Specialization talent. Questionably useful for tanking bosses since tanks ideally want to be defense capped. Much more useful when tanking trash mobs due to the damage mitigation it can provide, given that defense cap is not reached.[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shield_06.gif) Shield Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20150/shield-specialization) - Because either Redoubt or Holy Shield are going to be active much of the time that you're tanking, the block value gained from this talent will significantly improve the damage mitigation of blocks.[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_ambush.gif) Precision](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20193/precision) - Very useful talent to invest points into to hit high level enemies more often, improving threat generation.[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_devotion.gif) Toughness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20147/toughness) - Improves your physical damage mitigation.[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_lightningshield.gif) Blessing of Sanctuary](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20911/blessing-of-sanctuary) - Unlocks the Blessing of Sanctuary spell. Putting a point into this talent is also a prerequisite for unlocking the Holy Shield spell.[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealoffury.gif) Improved Righteous Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20470/improved-righteous-fury) - This is a mandatory talent to invest points into. This will significantly improve the threat generated of your holy spells when Righteous Fury is active.[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_lesserinvisibilty.gif) Anticipation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20100/anticipation) - At 5/5 points, this increases your Defense skill by 10, reducing the amount of Defense needed to Defense cap from 140 to 130, making it slightly easier to become uncrittable.[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_devotionaura.gif) Improved Devotion Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20142/improved-devotion-aura) - The increased armor from Devotion Aura will improve your physical damage mitigation. Devotion Aura is the most commonly used aura for tanking, so it's worth investing points into.[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_spell_holy_blessingofprotection.gif) Holy Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20925/holy-shield) - Unlocks the Holy Shield spell, which is one of the primary tools for paladin tanks.

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_windwalkon.gif) Benediction](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20105/benediction) - Reduces the mana consumption on your seal spells, allowing you to cast more Holy Shields and Consecrations.*4 Points will be leftover after Benediction, so it is up to you to decide how to split up the 4 points among the following three talents.*[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_parry.gif) Deflection](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20064/deflection) - Optional. Highly recommended to invest as many points into this talent as possible. Improves damage mitigation and survivability in the long-term.[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_holysmite.gif) Improved Seal of the Crusader](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20337/improved-seal-of-the-crusader) - Optional. Invest points into this talent if you want to improve your single-target threat generation.[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousfury.gif) Improved Judgement](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25957/improved-judgement) - Optional. If you like casting Judgements a bunch and don't like waiting the full 10 seconds, this is for you. I personally don't put points into this talent because that'll just incentivize me to use Judgements more often which would increase mana consumption.

Leveling as a Protection Paladin
--------------------------------

For leveling as a Protection Paladin, I'd recommend waiting until you're level 20 to start tanking dungeons if you have some tanking experience. At level 20, paladins can unlock [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_innerfire.gif) Consecration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=26573/consecration) in the Holy talent tree, which is an excellent AoE threat generation ability for dungeons.

**If this is your first time playing WoW Classic or have little to no tanking experience, expect tanking dungeons to be very difficult, as it requires more situational awareness and knowledge of mob/boss mechanics compared to healing or DPS roles.**

Protection paladins are some of the best dungeon tanks in WoW Classic (if you know what you're doing) and can easily cut through levels by grinding dungeons from level 20 to 60 which tends to provide much higher experience rates compared to questing in the open world. At some points, however, it got slow at transition levels in which I was either too high or too low level for some dungeons. If you're not familiar with the dungeons, make sure to check out the dungeon guides to get yourself up to speed!  
  
Video below is an example of me tanking a 10-man Scarlet Monastery run with heavy spell cleave. Prior to the experience nerf for 10-man dungeon raids, I was able to level up there every two hours, although the experience in 5-man groups is still very good.  
  

Below is a brief outline of recommended dungeons to grind for different level ranges:

* **20 - 24: The Deadmines (DM/VC/NO U):** Regardless of what people like to call it, this will very likely be the first dungeon you tank. As a starter dungeon, it is not that difficult and it is a good place to start becoming familar with positioning and maintaining threat.
* **24 - 30: The Stockades:** A very easy dungeon for Protection Paladins thanks to Consecration and cramped hallways. Experience gain can get a little slow towards the late 20's at this point so questing is a decent alternative unless you want to do Blackfathom Depths.
* **31 - 38 Gnomergan:** A fun dungeon with plenty of good loot. Not that many challenging mechanics or bosses.
* **32 - 44: Scarlet Monastery:** Your home for the next 10 or so levels. The cramped interiors and winding passageways of the mini-dungeons make them excellent for exploiting Line of SIght to do large AoE pulls. You'll probably make friends with many mages and warlocks along the way.
* **42 - 53: Zul'Farak Zombie Graveyard Runs:** With a good spellcleave group made up of warlocks and mages, experience rates will vary from 40k to 65k experience per hour. Do be wary that the zombies will hit hard even with full plate gear, so using a mage's improved Blizzards to kite adds is a useful strategy. Towards the early 50's the experience can taper off a bit, so questing is an option.
* **50 - 57: Blackrock Depths Prison/Arena Runs:** Doing circuits through the prison and arena loops will bring good experience and loot, although there are many mobs with dangerous mechaincs. When fighting Fire Elementals, use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_sealoffire.gif) Fire Resistance Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19899/fire-resistance-aura) to help mitigate some of the fire damage as they hit rather hard. Some of the mobs do [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_sunder.gif) Sunder Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11596/sunder-armor) on you so make sure to wait for the debuff to wear off before proceeding,
* **56 - 60: Lower Blackrock Spire Orc Runs:** You're finally at the home-run stretch and can barely see the finish line! Grinding through the orcs in LBRS up until the Ogre area then resetting can fetch hefty experience rates of 60k to 90k experience per hour. Make sure your group kills the Orc Warlocks first!

### Stat priorities

**The criteria I considered for items on the list are, in no particular order:**

* **Armor**
  + Primary source of physical damage reduction when struck.
* **Defense**
  + Reduces chance of being critically hit (2x damage). Raid bosses have 5.6% Critical Strike chance.
  + Defense (soft) cap for raid bosses is 440, with 140 Defense coming from gear at level 60. -0.04% per Defense point.
  + Increases Dodge, Parry, Block, and Miss % by 0.04% per Defense point.
  + For dungeons and 20-man trash, aim for at least 360 Defense.
  + For skulled enemies/bosses, go for at least 400 Defense. Not recommended to go for Defense cap, as you will usually end up gimping your other stats.
* **Dodge/Block/Parry %**
  + Improves damage mitigation from oncoming physical attacks
  + Uncrushable (1.5x damage) by raid boss at 102.4% combined Miss/Parry/Dodge/Block %
* **Stamina**
  + Increases your health pool by 10 HP per Stamina point.
* **Spell Damage**
  + Increases damage dealt by spells, improving threat generation.
  + Becomes increasingly useful when blessing spam threat generation cannot be relied upon, such as in dungeons or 20-man raids.
* **MP5**
  + Improves mana regeneration during combat, allowing for constant threat generation
* **Agility**
  + +1% Dodge per 20 Agility points.
  + +2 Armor per +1 Agility (armor contributions from agility added after armor multipliers).
* **Intellect**
  + Increases your base mana pool.
  + +15 mana per Intellect point.
* **Strength**
  + Increases total block value by 0.05 per Strength point. Marginally improves your block value.
  + Total Block Value = Shield Block Value + (Strength / 20)

Paladin tanks will often find themselves different types of situations in which different gear setups will improve/worsen your tanking potential.   
As such, stat priorities for gear will vary across dungeons, 20 man raids, and 40 main raids, as well as other situations including AoE farming.  
Based on experience thus far, this is a tentative stat priority for different types of tanking scenarios, especially if you are progressing as a guild.

### Weapons & Armor

The tables below contains recommended items to equip for each slot. Just because an item is not on this list does not mean that it's inadequate for tanking. There is no one-size-fits-all tanking set for all types of encounters, as different scenarios demand different solutions, such as sets for high damage mitigation, sets for high threat generation, sets for sustained mana regeneration, etc..Upon WoW Classic's release, not all items will be available due to content being launched in 6 different content phases, as outlined below:

1. Launch
2. (+2.5) Dire Maul, Azuregos & Kazzak
3. Blackwing Lair
4. Zul'Gurub & Dragons of Nightmare
5. Ahn'Qiraj & Dungeon Itemization Overhaul
6. Naxxramas

### [Paladin Tank Gear Recommendations](javascript:)

Weapons and Armor slots are separated by tabs, and items are split between content phases to provide the convenience of knowing when they will be available.  
**Note**: **This section IS NOT a BiS list separated by phase**. This is only a list of recommended paladin tanking gear to choose from when deciding how to itemize your paladin tank. Different gear setups will yield varying results on your threat and survivability depending on what you're tanking.

### Notable Items

Toggle to read analysis on each item.[**[![Libram of Hope](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_relics_libramofhope.gif) Libram of Hope](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22401/libram-of-hope)**](javascript:)

[![Libram of Hope](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_relics_libramofhope.gif) Libram of Hope](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22401/libram-of-hope) is the most useful out of all Paladin librams for tanking, due to the mana savings it can provide.  
As the tooltip states, equipping the libram will reduce the mana cost of your Seal spells by 20.  
  
**How to Acquire:**  
[![Libram of Hope](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_relics_libramofhope.gif) Libram of Hope](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22401/libram-of-hope) has a chance to drop from [Isalien](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=16097/isalien), located in [Dire Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2557/dire-maul) - East, and will only spawn upon using the [![Brazier of Invocation](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_23.gif) Brazier of Invocation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22057/brazier-of-invocation). For detailed information on how to acquire the [![Brazier of Invocation](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_23.gif) Brazier of Invocation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22057/brazier-of-invocation), check out the [Dungeon Set 1/2 Quest Walkthrough](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/dungeon-sets-1-2-quests-wow-classic).  
  
**How Good is it:**  
The mana savings from this item are far from game-breaking, but are still better than having an empty libram slot (or [![Egan's Blaster](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_rifle_05.gif) Egan's Blaster](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13289/egans-blaster)). Depending on how often you refresh your seals and what ranks you use, the mana savings will range from marginal to decent.  
  
To make the most of the libram's effect and minimize your Seal mana cost, make sure you are specced into [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_windwalkon.gif) Benediction](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20105/benediction).  
  
**Case 1: Two Seals per Minute (3.33 MP5)**  
Let's say that you are refreshing [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousnessaura.gif) Seal of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20357/seal-of-wisdom) exactly every 30 seconds, such that you cast it twice every 60 seconds.  
Two Seal casts per minute means that you will save 40 mana per 60 seconds, which is equivalent to approximately 3.33 MP5.  
  
**Case 2: Seven Seals per Minute (11.66 MP5)**  
Let's say that your talent build has [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousfury.gif) Improved Judgement](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25957/improved-judgement), which reduces your [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousfury.gif) Judgement](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20271/judgement) CD from 10 seconds to 8 seconds.  
Let's also say that you are casting Judgement on cooldown, and refreshing your Seal immediately afterwards, such that you cast a Seal 7 times per minute.  
Seven seal casts per minute means that you will save 140 mana per 60 seconds, which is equivalent to approximately 11.66 MP5. At the cost of these increased mana savings however, do consider that your mana consumption rate will be much higher due to casting Judgement and refreshing Seals much more often.

[**[![Mark of the Chosen](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_08.gif) Mark of the Chosen](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17774/mark-of-the-chosen)**](javascript:)

Despite being a low-level green trinket, this trinket is remarkable in terms of its stat bonuses and uptime for paladin tanks, even at level 60.The +25 stats buff from the proc directly translates into:

* +1.25% Dodge Chance from the +25 Agility
* +375 mana from the +25 Intellect
* +250 health from the +25 Stamina
* +1.25 Block Value from the +20 Strength

Although the 2% chance to proc when struck does lower expectations of the uptime, based on the number of mobs attacking you and their average attack speed, the trinket's buffcan be active for the entire duration of an encounter.A formula for calculating the approximate uptime percentage of the buff is as follows:  

```
Uptime % = 60 / (50 * avg_attack_speed / num_mobs) * 100  
  
-Variables:   
avg_attack_speed - average attack speed of mobs   
num_mobs - number of mobs attacking you  
  
-Assumptions:   
All attacks are hitting you. i.e. no attacks are being dodged, missed, parried, or blocked.  
Uptime % greater than or equal to 100% indicates buff will be up for entire duration of encounter
```

As shown by the table below, increasing the number of mobs and/or reducing their average attack speed will significantly increase the uptime of the buff. For trash packs with 3 or more mobs, the trinket's effect can be expected to be active for the entire duration of the fight.![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/18422.png)

[**[![Skullflame Shield](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shield_01.gif) Skullflame Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=1168/skullflame-shield)**](javascript:)

A very unique shield that shows its true potential when tanking large quantities of mobs. Its Flamestrike and Lifesteal procs gives the shield both offensive firepower and minor sustainability when it comes to AoE farming.Formulas for theoretical Procs per Minute (PPM) for the Flamestrike and Life Drain procs:  

```
Flamestrike PPM = (1/avg_attack_speed) * num_mobs * 0.01 * 60Life Drain PPM = (1/avg_attack_speed) * num_mobs * 0.03 * 60   
  
-Variables:   
avg_attack_speed: average attack speed of mobs  
num_mobs: number of mobs attacking you  
  
-Assumptions:   
Dodge, Miss, and Parry are not accounted for. E.g. 0% Avoidance.
```

At 2.00 mob attack speed and 0% avoidance, the Flamestrike PPM would increase by 1 and Life Drain PPM by 3 for every 3.33 mobs, as indicated by the following table.  
![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/18950.png)Chart showing relationship between number of mobs and the theoretical damage per minute of Skullflame Shield's abilities.![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/18951.png)

[**[![Force Reactive Disk](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_arcane_portaldarnassus.gif) Force Reactive Disk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18168/force-reactive-disk)**](javascript:)

To no one's shock, this shield synergizes beautifully with paladin tanks thanks to their Holy Shield ability. The DPS of the shield scales exponentially based on the number of mobs being tanked simultaneously.Some characteristics of the shield:

* Deals 25-35 Nature damage to each target within 10 yards
* The proc can crit based on your spell critical hit chance
* 50% chance on block for shield to lose 1 point of durability

Formula for calculating the maximum possible DPS from FRD procs.  

```
DPS = (block_chance / 100) * (1 / avg_attack_speed ) * 30 * (num_mobs ^ 2)  
  
-Variables:   
avg_attack_speed: average attack speed of mobs   
block_chance: total block chance = base block chance % + 30% block chance from Holy Shield   
num_mobs: number of mobs attacking you  
  
-Assumptions:   
Holy Shield uptime is 100% and has unlimated charges per cast cycle.   
Dodge, Miss, and Parry are not accounted for.   
Damage dealt by proc is 30
```

A unique characteristic of FRD DPS is that it scales exponentially based on the number of mobs being fought simultaneously.Below are two sets of tables and charts illustrating the FRD DPS formula in action.![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/18420.png)![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/18419.png)Based on the data shown, FRD excels when tanking groups of mobs rather than individual mobs (bosses).Note that max DPS will rarely be reached. For a more accurate expected DPS, multiply the max DPS by your combined Miss, Dodge, and Parry chance. To get a guesstimate DPS, multiply the theoretical max DPS by anywhere from 0.65 up to 0.80.

[**[![Thick Obsidian Breastplate](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_chain_17.gif) Thick Obsidian Breastplate](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22196/thick-obsidian-breastplate)**](javascript:)

A very unique chest piece with the niche role of being able to provide spell damage mitigation while tanking without needing to put on spell resist gear.The most opportune moments to equip this item is in dungeons where the majority of mobs are spell casters. i.e. Stratholme Living Side Cathedral, Scholomance, or Blackrock Depths Throne Room. It wouldn't be as effective against single-target boss caster enemies as the damage mitigated would be negligible.Below are formulas and spreadsheets demonstrating the effectiveness of this item, which can aid you in determining the most opportune time to equip it.Formula for calculating theoretical maximum Procs per Minute (PPM):  

```
PPM = (1 / cast_time) * num_mobs * 0.30 * 60  
  
-Variables:   
cast_time: time it takes for a mob to cast a spell.   
num_mobs: number of mobs that are spell casters  
  
.-Assumptions:   
Binary and Partial spell resists unaccounted for.   
Proc has no internal cooldown.   
Proc is consumed immediately to allow for subsequent procs shortly after.
```

![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/18432.png)Formula for calculating theoretical Damage Mitigation per MInute (DMM):  

```
DMM = ppm * 400  
  
-Variables:   
ppm: Procs per Minute of Thick Obsidian Breastplate. Calculated using the preceeding PPM formula.  
  
-Assumptions:   
Binary and Partial spell resists unaccounted for.   
Average damage mitigated per proc is 400 damage (300 floor, 500 ceiling).   
Proc has no internal cooldown.   
Proc is consumed immediately to allow for subsequent procs shortly after.
```

![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/18433.png)Formula for calculating the theoretical % spell damage mitigation:  

```
% Mitigation = (dmp * 0.3 / spell_dmg_total) * 100  
  
-Variables:   
dmp: spell damage mitigated per proc. Range is 300 to 500.   
spell_dmg_total: total spell damage of a single cast dealt by enemy spell caster.  
  
-Assumptions:   
Binary and Partial spell resists unaccounted for.   
Average damage mitigated per proc is 400 damage (300 floor, 500 ceiling).   
Proc has no internal cooldown.   
Proc is consumed immediately to allow for subsequent procs shortly after.
```

![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/18434.png)As shown by the data, spell damage mitigation is higher when fighting spellcaster mobs that deal 500 damage or less, with at least 24% of the damage being mitigated, assuming that the average damage mitigated per proc is 400. This indicates that the chest is most effective in scenarios where there are several spell caster mobs that deal relatively minor damage.

[**[![Demon Forged Breastplate](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_plate06.gif) Demon Forged Breastplate](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12628/demon-forged-breastplate)**](javascript:)

Formula for calculating theoretical Heals per Second (HPS) while equipping item:  

```
HPS = (1 / avg_atk_spd) * (num_mobs) * 0.03 * [120 + (0.4 * spell_dmg) ]  
  
-Variables:   
avg_atk_spd: average attack speed of mobs.  
 num_mobs: number of mobs.   
spell_dmg: bonus spell damage from gear and buffs.  
  
-Assumptions:   
Miss, Dodge, Parry, and Block not accounted for.   
Proc has no internal cooldown.
```

Dungeon Tanking
---------------

Paladin tanks shine in dungeons thanks to their AoE threat generation, but they are not invincinble.

### Rotations

The spell rotation for paladin tanks is very straightforward, however, depending on the engagement, you will need to maintain high threat on a single target, or threat evenly spread out amongst multiple targets. The primary considerations about maintaining threat generation is that they have to exceed the healer's threat and damage dealer's threat so that you don't lose aggro on your targets. The first ten seconds of a pull are the most crucial towards maintaining aggro for the rest of the encounter, since if you are unable to build up enough threat within this period of time, it is very likely that you will struggle to maintain aggro on enemies.**Make sure to have [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealoffury.gif) Righteous Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25780/righteous-fury) active prior to pulling, or else your threat generation will be ineffective.****Trash mob rotation**

1. Seal of Righteousness
   * Only refresh when buff about to expire or judgement has been used.
   * Depending on threat of each enemy, melee enemies being attacked by damage dealers to maintain aggro.
2. Holy Shield
   * Use Rank 1 to minimize mana consumption.
   * If Holy Shield and Consecration cooldowns are refreshed at the same time, go with Holy Shield, as damage mitigation is generally more important.
3. Consecration
   * Use Rank 5 for your first cast to maximize initial threat on mobs. Use Rank 1 for subsequent casts to maintain consistent threat generation and minimize mana consumption.
   * If your party is casting AoE spells on the entire trash pack to kill them simultaneously, keep using high rank casts.

**Single-target rotation**

1. Seal of the Crusader
   * Skip if Judgement of the Crusader debuff has already been applied on your target.
2. Judgement
3. Seal of Righteousness
   * Only refresh when buff about to expire or judgement has been used.
   * Depending on threat of each enemy, melee enemies being attacked by damage dealers to maintain aggro.
4. Holy Shield
   * Use Rank 1 to minimize mana consumption.
   * If Holy Shield and Consecration cooldowns are refreshed at the same time, go with Holy Shield, as damage mitigation is generally more important.
5. Consecration
   * Use Rank 5 for your first cast to maximize initial threat on mobs. Use Rank 1 for subsequent casts to maintain consistent threat generation and minimize mana consumption.

**Wisdom Rotation**  
For those that want to prioritize mana regeneration while still generating good threat. Recommended rotation.

* Maintain Seal of Wisdom and Judgement of Wisdom up on your current target at all times.
  + Use a fast weapon to maximize the amount of mana restored by Judgement of Wisdom
  + Mana restored by SoW/JoW also generates threat on your current target, so you will have additional single-target threat without having to use Seal of Righteousness.
* Holy Shield
  + Use Rank 3 to maximize threat generation.
  + If Holy Shield and Consecration cooldowns are refreshed at the same time, go with Holy Shield, as damage mitigation is generally more important.
* Consecration
  + Use Rank 5 for your first cast to maximize initial threat on mobs. You can keep using Rank 5 Consecration for much longer because of SoW/JoW mana regeneration.

### Line of Sight Pulling

Many trash packs will often contain a mix of melee and ranged enemies, which can make it difficult to keep all of them within a Consecration's area of effect and in range of crowd control abilities when necessary. Damage from ranged enemies is also generally magic based, and such spells can easily melt a tank unless they're killed quickly or kept in melee range, in which case they wlil alternate between spells and melee attacks which tend to be very weak.An effective solution to this problem is to exploit the line of sight of enemies to force them to move to you in a location where they can be kept close together. The general idea of line of sight pulling is to get within line of sight of a trash pack, them move back to a spot beyond their line of sight so they can't target you, forcing them to move to your location in which the tanking situation will be much more favorable to your party. Below is a simple illustration of how to execute a line of sight pull as a paladin tank.

![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/18252.jpg)

Simple walkthrough of the illustration:

1. Start Point/End Point. This is where you'll be tanking the mobs.
2. Drop your first consecration here.
3. Max aggro radius of mob. Pull mobs at this point then run back to your starting point.
4. End Point. Drop your second consecration here. Once all mobs are in melee range, resume your rotation.

Paladin Raid Tanking for Dummies
--------------------------------

### Prelude

They said it couldn't be done. They said it wouldn't be done. They said it shouldn't be done. They doubted it would ever be done.  
  
Recent discoveries and advances in understanding paladin mechanics have provided paladins with the tools necessary to become viable raid tanks, minus a few encounters where taunts are required as part of a tank rotation. This is primarily due to blessing spam being a powerful long-range threat generation tool that can allow paladin tanks to easily compete against warrior tanks on threat generation, and even trivialize certain encounters. As spellpower is no longer essential for threat generation in raids, paladin tanks are also able to maintain relatively high defensive stats, especially compared to fury-prot warrior tanks.

**Disclaimers**

* Using consumables is essential for improving your survivability and effectiveness as a raid tank.
* Make sure to coordinate with fellow tanks on tanking assignments and strategies. Raid tanking is a team effort!
* The massive threat generation of Greater Blessing spam is a doubled-edged sword. Recklessly spamming it for threat may result in accidentally stealing aggro from other tanks' targets, leading to widespread chaos in the raid. Using threat meters to keep track of the threat of other tanks is a must.
* Encounters that require immediate taunt rotations will still be a significant barrier for paladin tanks
* Have fun!

### Raid Tanking Rotations

The three core requirements of a prot paladin's rotation for raid encounters are the following:

* Threat Generation
* Damage Mitigation
* Mana Regeneration

Raid boss encounters tend to be rather long, so there is not much room for flexibility when it comes selecting other abilities that will satisfy the three core requirements. **Primary Raid Rotation:**

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousnessaura.gif) Seal of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20357/seal-of-wisdom)/[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousnessaura.gif) Judgement of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20355/judgement-of-wisdom)
  + This is your primary source of mana regeneration. Critical towards perpetuating your rotation and not going OOM.
  + Maintain Seal and Judgement of Wisdom up on your current target at all times.
  + Use a fast weapon to maximize the amount of mana restored by Judgement of Wisdom
  + Mana restored by SoW/JoW also generates threat on your current target, so you will have additional single-target threat without having to use Seal of Righteousness.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_spell_holy_blessingofprotection.gif) Holy Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20925/holy-shield)
  + This is your primary source of damage mitigation.
  + Use Rank 1 to minimize mana consumption.
  + To maximize your damage mitigation, it is imperative to keep this ability up as often as possible.
  + If damage mitigation isn't an issue, and threat generation is your priority, you can skip using this in your rotation.
  + The most ideal situation to use Holy Shield in is while [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_defend.gif) Redoubt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20137/redoubt) is active after being crit, as you'll be able to simultanesouly maximize your Holy Shield blocks and temporarily flatten your damage intake through reducing your Crushing Blow chance.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_greaterblessingofkings.gif) Greater Blessing of Kings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25898/greater-blessing-of-kings)
  + **This is your primary source of threat generation.**
  + Over the course of a raid, you will likely consume hundreds to thousands of [![Symbol of Kings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_symbolofkings_01.gif) Symbol of Kings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=21177/symbol-of-kings) so make sure to bring plenty.
  + Spam cast only when necessary to maintain aggro on your target.
  + At the start of fights, spam cast at least 10 times to have a sizable threat base, then cast intermitently to for steady threat generation while reducing mana consumption.
  + To maximize threat generated per cast, ensure that you're casting it on class with the highest number of players.

**Additional Considerations**

* If you are in a high-performing guild (<120 second boss kill times), it will usually be the case that tanks must prioritize threat generation over mana regeneration and damage mitigation. In such scenarios, using each GCD to its full threat potential is a must, in which case, casting GBoK will be the preferred option. If GBoK threat generation is barely keeping up with threat from your raid DPS, consider how you can maximize your passive (autoattack) non-GBoK threat generation.
* For white damage, use weapons with a higher DPS value.
* If using [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_thunderbolt.gif) Seal of Righteousness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20293/seal-of-righteousness), use a relatively fast weapon (<2 Second Swing) and maximize your Spell Damage.
* If using [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_innerrage.gif) Seal of Command](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20920/seal-of-command), use a slow weapon (>2 Second Swing) to maximize damage from SoC procs.
* Avoid using [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_innerfire.gif) Consecration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20924/consecration), as it applies a hidden debuff to enemies and uses up one of the 16 debuff slots.

* Use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_sealoffire.gif) Fire Resistance Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19900/fire-resistance-aura) to reduce damage taken from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_immolation.gif) Immolate](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20294/immolate) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_volcano.gif) Eruption](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19497/eruption).
* Expect to tank multiple [Firesworn](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12099/firesworn) adds. Their damage will pile up, so [![Greater Stoneshield Potion](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_69.gif) Greater Stoneshield Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13455/greater-stoneshield-potion) is highly recommended.
* Try to have at least 2 dedicated healers assigned to you, and an additional healer to focus on cleansing [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_immolation.gif) Immolate](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20294/immolate) from you.
* Before adds die and knock you back with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_volcano.gif) Eruption](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19497/eruption), position yourself against the wall so you don't get knocked into trash packs nearby.
* At the start of the encounter, use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_innerfire.gif) Consecration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20924/consecration) to help you build up threat on multiple adds. Blessing spam isn't as useful early in the encounter due to the threat being split up between adds.

**Paladin Tank PoV**

**Tips & Strategies**

* It is essential to have a Fire Resist set with at least 275 Fire Resistance (including [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_sealoffire.gif) Fire Resistance Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19900/fire-resistance-aura)).
* You can remove [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_incinerate.gif) Ignite Mana](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19659/ignite-mana) from yourself and fellow mana-users with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_renew.gif) Cleanse](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=4987/cleanse).
* Be sure to run away from Baron when he casts [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_incinerate.gif) Inferno](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19695/inferno) or shield yourself with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_divineintervention.gif) Divine Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1020/divine-shield).

* If main-tanking Golemagg, excess stacks of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_immolation.gif) Magma Splash](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=13880/magma-splash) can be removed by casting [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_divineintervention.gif) Divine Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1020/divine-shield). Before you do this, make sure that your threat is at least 10% higher than the person with the second highest threat. Be sure to remove the buff immediately afterwards to regain aggro on Golemagg.
* When assigned to tank [Core Rager](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11672/core-rager), make sure to move the dog far away from Golemagg so that the dog's horns stop glowing red, which will significantly reduce its damage output.

The threat generated by blessing spam bypasses the need to generate threat via physical or magic damage.
* A side effect of using blessing spam throughout the fight is that in case any other tanks die, any mobs that they were tanking will very likely target you next, so make sure that your healers are prepared to quickly focus on you.

* As a mana user, you are a potential target for [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_volcano.gif) Lava Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=21158/lava-burst). As a precaution, be sure to distance yourself from the melee and tank group so they do not get knocked back in case you get hit by the spell.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_soulburn.gif) Wrath of Ragnaros](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20566/wrath-of-ragnaros) resets Ragnaros' entire threat table and knocks up 3 random players that are at melee range. If you're not knocked back, immediately start blessing spamming to regain aggro on Ragnaros if any other tanks have been knocked back and are unable to taunt.
* You can use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_divineintervention.gif) Divine Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1020/divine-shield) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofprotection.gif) Blessing of Protection](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10278/blessing-of-protection) to shield yourself against fall damage after being knocked up by [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_soulburn.gif) Wrath of Ragnaros](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20566/wrath-of-ragnaros),
* In case Ragnaros submerges, start blessing spam in order to get aggro on all the [Son of Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12143/son-of-flame) that spawn. Right before they reach you, cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_innerfire.gif) Consecration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20924/consecration) to build additional threat, allowing your casters to easily defeat them with AoE.

**Paladin Tank PoV**

### Onyxia

*Onyxia is a raid boss which paladin tanks can excel at compared to other tanks, as they are capable of consistently maintaining aggro on Onyxia for both Phases 1 and 3, as well as being able to easily round up whelps during Phase 2.*

**Tips & Strategy**

* For this encounter, aim to have about 150 Fire Resistance (including [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_sealoffire.gif) Fire Resistance Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19900/fire-resistance-aura)), and at least 380 Defense *if you want to play it safe*.
* **Phase 1**
  + At the start of the fight, make sure to have Onyxia properly positioned. Try to stand with your back aginst the rear wall of the arena.
  + Once Onyxia has been positioned, start building lots of threat with blessing spam in order to have a large threat cushion for Phase 2.
  + Try to use a [![Major Mana Potion](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_76.gif) Major Mana Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13444/major-mana-potion) as early as possible in order to have a cooldown reset midway through Phase 2 or 3.
* **Phase 2**
  + Onyxia's targets for her [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_flamebolt.gif) Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18392/fireball) ARE NOT RANDOM. Onyxia chooses her targets based on what player is currently at the top of her threat table.
  + You will very likely be hit with Onyxia's [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_flamebolt.gif) Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18392/fireball) one or more times throughout Phase 2 due to being high on Onyxia's threat table. Each [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_flamebolt.gif) Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18392/fireball) that hits you will reduce your current threat on Onyxia by somewhere between 50% to 75%.
  + Make sure to grab any Whelps that spawn from the left/right hatcheries with your [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_innerfire.gif) Consecration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20924/consecration).
  + After all the whelps have been slain, you can resume blessing spam in order to maintain yourself high up on the threat table despite being fireballed repeatedly. If possible, use another [![Major Mana Potion](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_76.gif) Major Mana Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13444/major-mana-potion) at this point.
  + To minimize the chances of being hit with a [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_flamebolt.gif) Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18392/fireball) while building threat during Phase 2, wait until Onyxia is at 45% health or less, depending on how fast the raid DPS is.
  + You should only use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_divineintervention.gif) Divine Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1020/divine-shield) if you are caught in the middle of a [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_fire.gif) Breath](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17086/breath). It is not worth using [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_divineintervention.gif) Divine Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1020/divine-shield) to protect yourself against Onyxia's [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_flamebolt.gif) Fireball](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18392/fireball), since even if it fully does shield you, she'll likely target you again once the bubble expires.
* **Phase 3**
  + As Onyxia is landing, keep up the blessing spam in order to reach the top of Onyxia's threat table.
  + Even if Onyxia doesn't initially aggro after she lands, keep up the blessing spam while trying to position yourself at the spot where she was tanked in during Phase 1.
  + Once you regain aggro on Onyxia and have her properly postioned, resume your ability rotation as well as blessing spam.
  + Make sure that any Dwarf priests in your raid maintain [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_excorcism.gif) Fear Ward](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=6346/fear-ward) buffed on you at all times.

### Blackwing Lair

*Blackwing Lair is the next raid tier after Molten Core, and will subquently have increasingly difficult bosses and trash mobs to tank. Raid consumables are absolutely required at this point. Despite some bosses such as Ebonroc requiring taunt rotations, it is still more than possible to successfully main tank or off-tank any boss alongside your raid's other tanks without hampering your raid's effectiveness in Blackwing Lair.*

  + Use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofmight.gif) Hammer of Justice](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10308/hammer-of-justice) to stun any Blackrock Mages.
* **Razorgore the Untamed**
  + Have at least 150 Fire Resist from gear and buffs to reduce damage from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_flamebolt.gif) Fireball Volley](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22425/fireball-volley) and potentially resist [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_incinerate.gif) Conflagration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16805/conflagration).
  + Use blessing spam to maintain high threat so that you can become next aggro target if other tanks become Conflagged.

**Paladin Tank PoV**

**Tips & Strategies**

* Have at least 250+ Fire Resist from gear and buffs to reduce damage taken from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_fire.gif) Flame Breath](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23461/flame-breath), which is the primary source of damage taken.
* It is recommended that paladins tank Vaelastrasz first because they are still susceptible to the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_03.gif) Burning Adrenaline](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18173/burning-adrenaline) targetted towards mana-users every 15 seconds even if they are tanking. The [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_03.gif) Burning Adrenaline](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18173/burning-adrenaline) targetted towards the current tank only occurs every 45 seconds.
* Before the fight begins, have Seal of Righteousness, Holy Shield, and Conscration up in order to maximize your threat at the start.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_lavaspawn.gif) Essence of the Red](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23513/essence-of-the-red) will provide you with virtually unlimited mana, so try to use every GCD possible for blessing spam to maximize your threat.

**Paladin Tank PoV**

**Tips & Strategies**

* Maximize your armor and health in order to survive Broodlord's [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_savageblow.gif) Mortal Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24573/mortal-strike), which can easily hit you for 7k+ damage at 9500+ armor.
* It is highly recommended that you use [![Greater Stoneshield Potion](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_69.gif) Greater Stoneshield Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13455/greater-stoneshield-potion) and [![Flask of the Titans](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_62.gif) Flask of the Titans](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13510/flask-of-the-titans) for this fight.
* Since whelps will continuously respawn throughout the fight, so it is essential that you only blessing spam after all whelps have been killed so that your threat doesn't get split to maximize your TPS.

**Paladin Tank PoV**

**Tips & Strategies**

* Equip [![Onyxia Scale Cloak](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_05.gif) Onyxia Scale Cloak](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=15138/onyxia-scale-cloak) to mitigate the effects [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_incinerate.gif) Shadow Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22539/shadow-flame), especially its DoT.

It is also possible to fully resist applications of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_fireball.gif) Flame Buffet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23341/flame-buffet) which can eventually cause your stacks to clear.
* Successive melee damage taken from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ghoulfrenzy.gif) Thrash](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=3391/thrash) can quickly eat away at your health, so [![Greater Stoneshield Potion](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_69.gif) Greater Stoneshield Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13455/greater-stoneshield-potion) and [![Flask of the Titans](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_62.gif) Flask of the Titans](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13510/flask-of-the-titans) are recommended.
* Keep Firemaw facing facing away from the raid so they don't get hit by [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_incinerate.gif) Shadow Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22539/shadow-flame).
* Make sure that you and any other tanks are prepared to reposition when Firemaw casts [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_monsterscales_14.gif) Wing Buffet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23339/wing-buffet) on the current tank.
* If off-tanking Firemaw, you can build threat with blessing spam without being in LoS of Firemaw to avoid [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_incinerate.gif) Shadow Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22539/shadow-flame).

**Paladin Tank PoV**

**Tips & Strategies**

* Chromaggus will always have 75% damage reduction against Holy damage, so the majority of your threat should come from blessing spam, which is unaffected by this.
* Successive melee damage taken from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_challangingroar.gif) Frenzy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23342/frenzy) and breaths can quickly eat away at your health, so [![Greater Stoneshield Potion](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_69.gif) Greater Stoneshield Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13455/greater-stoneshield-potion) and [![Flask of the Titans](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_62.gif) Flask of the Titans](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13510/flask-of-the-titans) are recommended.
* If none of Chromaggus' breaths are [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_arcane_portalorgrimmar.gif) Time Lapse](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23310/time-lapse), Chromaggus becomes a simple tank-and-spank fight.
* Make sure to cleanse [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_head_dragon_blue.gif) Brood Affliction: Blue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23153/brood-affliction-blue) from yourself as soon as possible in order to prevent your mana from being drained.
* As an off-tank, you can continue building threat with blessing spam out of Chromaggus' LoS to avoid his breaths, which can be useful if Chromaggus' breath rotation includes [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_arcane_portalorgrimmar.gif) Time Lapse](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23310/time-lapse). Be prepared to reposition yourself if Chromaggus aggros on you after MT is hit by [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_arcane_portalorgrimmar.gif) Time Lapse](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23310/time-lapse) breath.
* Prior to Frost  breaths, activate [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_wizardmark.gif) Frost Resistance Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19898/frost-resistance-aura) to reduce damage taken from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_chillingblast.gif) Frost Burn](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23187/frost-burn).
* Prior to Black or Red breaths, activate [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_sealoffire.gif) Fire Resistance Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19900/fire-resistance-aura) to reduce damage taken from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_fire.gif) Ignite Flesh](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23316/ignite-flesh) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_chilltouch.gif) Incinerate](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23309/incinerate), respectively.

**Paladin Tank PoV** - *Footage provided by Holyfrog.*

**Tips & Strategies**

* **Phase 1: Dragonkins**
  + Avoid tanking sides that spawn [Blue Drakonid](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=14261/blue-drakonid) due to their mana drain ability, which will reduce your threat generation.
  + Use SoR and Conscecration to maintain aggro on any adds that spawn.
  + This phase is rather mana-intensive, so be prepared to use mana consumables like [![Major Mana Potion](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_76.gif) Major Mana Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13444/major-mana-potion).
  + After all the dragonkin have been slain, it is possible to get out of combat, allowing you to switch to your boss tanking gear.
* **Phase 2: Nefarian**
  + Equip [![Onyxia Scale Cloak](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_05.gif) Onyxia Scale Cloak](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=15138/onyxia-scale-cloak) to mitigate the effects [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_incinerate.gif) Shadow Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22539/shadow-flame), especially its DoT.
  + If main tanking Nefarian, ensure that your priests keep [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_excorcism.gif) Fear Ward](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=6346/fear-ward) up on you at all times so you don't get feared by [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_charm.gif) Bellowing Roar](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22686/bellowing-roar).
  + Tanks should be buffed with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_antishadow.gif) Shadow Protection](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10958/shadow-protection), as it is possible to fully resist Nefarian's [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_incinerate.gif) Shadow Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22539/shadow-flame) breath.
  + During Paladin class calls in which Nefarian's [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofprotection.gif) Improved Blessing of Protection](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23415/improved-blessing-of-protection) grants him immunity to physical damage, you can continue building threat with blessing spam, so your threat generation should largely be unaffected.
  + For Rogue  class calls, in which rogues get teleported and stuck at your current location, make sure to reposition Nefarian so the your rogues don't get hit by [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_cleave.gif) Cleave](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=26350/cleave) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_incinerate.gif) Shadow Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22539/shadow-flame).
* **Phase 3: Bone Constructs**
  + As soon as the [Bone Construct](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=14605/bone-construct) spawn when Nefarian is at 20% health, start blessing spamming so that they all aggro and run towards you.
  + It is recommended that you only handle Bone Constructs if you're currently main-tanking Nefarian.
  + Make sure that healers are preapred to heal you as you will take lots of damage.
  + Before the Bone Constructs reach you, cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_excorcism.gif) Holy Wrath](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10318/holy-wrath) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_innerfire.gif) Consecration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20924/consecration) to build threat against them.
  + You can also use [![Stratholme Holy Water](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_75.gif) Stratholme Holy Water](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13180/stratholme-holy-water) or [![Goblin Sapper Charge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Sapper Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge) to deal additional damage and threat.

**Tips & Strategies**

* **Goblin Technicians**
  + You can kite the technicians and maintain aggro with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_innerfire.gif) Consecration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20924/consecration).
  + Fire resistance gear is not necessary as the explosives cannot be mitigated or resisted.
* **Death Talon Wyrmguards**
  + Wyrmguards will always have 75% damage reduction against Holy damage, so the majority of your threat should come from blessing spam, which is unaffected by this.
  + Avoid tanking Wyrmguards that cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_head_dragon_blue.gif) Brood Affliction: Blue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23153/brood-affliction-blue) on you, as it will quickly drain you of your mana which will negatively affect your threat generation.
  + Use a [![Free Action Potion](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_04.gif) Free Action Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=5634/free-action-potion) at the start to avoid getting stunned by [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_bullrush.gif) War Stomp](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24375/war-stomp).
* **Blackwing Spellbinders**

+ Even though Spellbinders are immune to all magic damage, you can build threat on them with blessing spam, which bypasses this immunity.

### Zul'Gurub

*Zul'Gurub is a 20-man raid instance with many bosses and valuable pieces of loot for players of all raid tiers. Although Zul'Gurub is generally regarded as easier than Molten Core in terms of difficulty and gear requirements, it can still pose a challenge for paladin tanks by putting their combined dungeon and raid tanking skills to the test. Due to the 20-player cap, the threat potential of GBoK spam will be significantly reduced, so paladin tanks will have to increasingly rely upon their entire arsenal of abilities for threat and equip Spellpower-heavy gear such as the [Judgement Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=217/judgement-armor).*

**Tips & Strategies**

* **Phase 1 (Bat form)**
  + Jeklik can cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_teleport.gif) Sonic Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23918/sonic-burst), an AoE silence that will silence anyone within 20 yards of her, so make sure that your healers are at least 20 yards away from the boss so that they can dispel/cleanse the silence debuff from you.
  + Jeklik will occasionally summon waves of [Frenzied Bloodseeker Bat](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=14965/frenzied-bloodseeker-bat) which can be easily dealt with using Consecration and caster AoE abilities.
  + Face the boss away from the rest of the raid so that they don't get stunned by [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_cleave.gif) Swoop](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23919/swoop).
  + You can remove the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_vampiricaura.gif) Pierce Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12097/pierce-armor) debuff using [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_divineintervention.gif) Divine Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1020/divine-shield), but doing so will make you temporarily lose aggro, so make sure to quickly remove the bubble buff to regain aggro.
* **Phase 2 (Priest form**)
  + If possible, have your priests maintain [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_excorcism.gif) Fear Ward](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=6346/fear-ward) on you to avoid being feared by Jeklik's [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_psychicscream.gif) Psychic Scream](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22884/psychic-scream).
  + Bats flying above the raid will occasionally cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_meteorstorm.gif) Throw Liquid Fire](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23970/throw-liquid-fire) which creates fires on the ground that will hurt anyone standing in them. If a firebomb lands on you, make sure to reposition the boss.
  + Make sure your damage dealers interrupt Jeklik every time she begins casting [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_heal.gif) Great Heal](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23954/great-heal).

**Paladin Tank PoV**

**Tips & Strategies**

* **Phase 1 (Priest form)**
  + If tanking the snakes at the start of the fight, bring them downstairs and use Consecration to maintain aggro on them while your DPS takes them down.
  + Venoxis will occasionally cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_siphonmana.gif) Holy Wrath](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23979/holy-wrath), an ability that hits the tank for 300 Holy damage and will chain to nearby players, multiplying in damage by 1.30 for every additional player hit. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_siphonmana.gif) Holy Wrath](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23979/holy-wrath) does not have a limit to how times it can chain, so it can easily cause wipes. At the 10th chain, the damage dealt is over 4k, meaning subsequent chains will very likely be lethal.
  + Position Venoxis away from the rest of the raid, preferably 30-40 yards.
  + It is highly recommended that melee damage-dealers not engage Venoxis during Phase 1 to prevent massive [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_siphonmana.gif) Holy Wrath](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23979/holy-wrath) chains.
* **Phase 2 (Snake form)**
  + Venoxis will stop casting [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_siphonmana.gif) Holy Wrath](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23979/holy-wrath) during this phase so melee damage-dealers are now free to engage the boss.
  + Venoxis must be repositioned every time he casts [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_naturetouchdecay.gif) Poison Cloud](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23861/poison-cloud) because the poison clouds will hurt anyone standing inside them.

**Tips & Strategies**

* **Phase 1 (Priest form)**
  + Use Consecration to get aggro on any spiderlings that spawn.
  + You can remove any poison debuffs from yourself using [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_renew.gif) Cleanse](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=4987/cleanse).
* **Phase 2 (Spider form)**
  + Mar'li can cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_earthbind.gif) Enveloping Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24110/enveloping-webs) which will hit anyone within 20 yards of her and wipe their aggro. There should be another tank with the ranged/healer group ready to pick up Mar'li.
  + You can use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_divineintervention.gif) Divine Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1020/divine-shield) to free yourself from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_earthbind.gif) Enveloping Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24110/enveloping-webs), although your aggro will still be wiped out.
  + If you're the tank assigned to the ranged/healing group, you can still build some threat using GBoK spam, although it won't necessarily guarantee that Mar'li will aggro on you after she wipes the MT's aggro.
  + Mar'li will occasionally cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_corrosivebreath.gif) Corrosive Poison](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24111/corrosive-poison) on the tank which applies a nasty debuff and should be cleansed as soon as possible.

**Paladin Tank PoV**

**Tips & Strategies**

* This fight requires 2 to 3 tanks; 1 tank for Mandokir, and 1-2 tanks for Ohgan.
* **Bloodlord Mandokir**
  + Mandokir is tauntable.
  + **Note:** The charges from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_charm.gif) Threatening Gaze](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24314/threatening-gaze) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_charge.gif) Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24408/charge) have their own separate mechanics.
  + Approximately every 30 seconds, Mandokir will [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_charge.gif) Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24408/charge) the player that is furthest away from him and within a 30-yards, followed by a permanent aggro wipe. Damage on Mandokir should stop after every [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_charge.gif) Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24408/charge) until the tank can regain and build up threat.
  + See the positioning diagram below for an idea of how to position Bloodlord and your raid to minimize aggro issues after the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_charge.gif) Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24408/charge) aggro wipes. If done correctly, only one person should be getting hit by [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_charge.gif) Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24408/charge) and the tank should be able to easily intercept Mandokir to regain aggro on him.
  + If you receive the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_charm.gif) Threatening Gaze](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24314/threatening-gaze) debuff, immediately stop anything that you're doing, including movement, autoattacks, ability rotations, etc., or else Mandokir will charge at you and hit you with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_punishingblow.gif) Guillotine](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24316/guillotine), which can potentially be fatal even as a tank. Note that this ability will not cause an aggro wipe.
  + Mandokir's other abilities include [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_meleedamage.gif) Overpower](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24407/overpower), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_whirlwind.gif) Whirlwind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=13736/whirlwind), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_savageblow.gif) Mortal Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16856/mortal-strike), each of which hit fairly hard on tanks. These abilities may sometimes occur one after another, so make sure your healers are keeping you topped off on health.
* **Ohgan (Raptor)**
  + Ohgan is tauntable.
  + Ohgan will intermittently cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_sunder.gif) Sunder Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24317/sunder-armor) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ghoulfrenzy.gif) Thrash](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=3391/thrash) on their target. which can become a potentially deadly combo if the tank has a high number of stacks. If the tank has too many stacks and is taking too much damage, a taunt rotation may be necessary so that the stacks can wear off.
  + You can remove [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_sunder.gif) Sunder Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24317/sunder-armor) stacks using [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_divineintervention.gif) Divine Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1020/divine-shield), but doing so will make you temporarily lose aggro, so make sure to quickly remove the bubble to regain aggro again.
  + If Ohgan is killed first, then Bloodlord Mandokir will receive a powerful buff that increases his damage dealt and attack speed, making his autoattacks and abilities much deadlier. It is not recommended to kill Ohgan first.

**Positioning Diagram**![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/19950.jpg)**Paladin Tank PoV**

**Tips & Strategies**

* **Phase 1 (Trio)**
  + Thekal’s autoattacks and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_savageblow.gif) Mortal Cleave](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22859/mortal-cleave) ability can hit fairly hard on tanks.
  + Thekal can [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_silence.gif) Silence](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22666/silence) you, so make sure healers are ready to dispel it.
  + Thekal will occasionally buff an ally with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_bloodlust.gif) Bloodlust](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24185/bloodlust), which can make them slightly more dangerous.
  + To prevent Thekal from healing the other mini-bosses, you can position Thekal out of line of sight of them around a corner. Thekal can still heal himself so DPS should still be ready to interrupt or counterspell his healing casts.
  + Zealot Zath regularly casts [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_gouge.gif) Gouge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12540/gouge) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_mindsteal.gif) Blind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=21060/blind) on her current tank, causing her to temporarily switch aggro to the person with the most threat after the tank. Try to maintain secondary threat or stun Lor’Khan with Hammer of Justice so that she doesn’t attack DPS or healers.
  + Once all three mini-bosses are at low health, tanks should group them up so that they can AoE’d down by DPS to defeat them simultaneously or else they will resurrect.
* **Phase 2 (Tiger form)**
  + Thekal will periodically summon [Zulian Guardian](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15068/zulian-guardian), which can either be nuked down or CC'd.
  + Theka's [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_31.gif) Force Punch](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24189/force-punch) will knockback the tank and wipe their aggro, so make sure there's another tank ready to pick up aggro on Thekal.
  + Thekal can Flurry, Enrage, and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ghoulfrenzy.gif) Speed Slash](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24192/speed-slash) so make sure your healers are ready to keep you topped off on health.

**Tips & Strategies**

* **Phase 1 (Priest form)**
  + Arlokk will occasionally cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_gouge.gif) Gouge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12540/gouge) on the main tank, so make sure another tank is ready to pick her up.
  + Anyone that receives [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_hunter_snipershot.gif) Mark of Arlokk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24210/mark-of-arlokk) should move to the back of the room near the entryway to try to avoid getting aggro from panthers that spawn from the pens, as Line of Sight is required for [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_hunter_snipershot.gif) Mark of Arlokk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24211/mark-of-arlokk) to give aggro the afflicted player.
  + If tanking panther spawns, stay in the pens and within line of sight of healers. Use Consecration to build threat on panther spawns.
  + Another way to deal with panther spawns is to have the DPS quickly take them down with AoE.
* **Phase 2 (Panther form**)
  + In her Panther form, Arlokk will be able to cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ghoulfrenzy.gif) Thrash](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=3391/thrash), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_whirlwind.gif) Whirlwind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24236/whirlwind), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ghoulfrenzy.gif) Ravage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24213/ravage) which means the tank will llikely be taking more damage.
  + Arlokk will periodically stealth while in Panther form. Tanks should be ready to get aggro on her once she unstealths, as she can quickly kill your casters and healers.

**Tips & Strategies**

* At the start of the fight, if you're tanking the troll mobs near Jindo, make sure your mages and druids quickly decurse you to remove [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_ritualofsacrifice.gif) Curse of Blood](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24673/curse-of-blood) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_gathershadows.gif) Veil of Shadow](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24674/veil-of-shadow) from you.
* It is recommended that you tank Jin'do near the pool where the [Sacrificed Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=14826/sacrificed-troll) spawn so that you can get aggro on them using Conscration after somebody has been teleported into the pool.
* Make sure other tanks are ready to pick up aggro on Jin'do in case the main tank gets [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_lesserinvisibilty.gif) Banish](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24466/banish).
* If Jin'do casts [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_polymorph.gif) Hex](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17172/hex) on you, you will temporarily lose aggro until the debuff is removed. Have your healers dispel the Hex from you as soon as possible.
* Have your melee DPS prioritize destroying the Brain Wash and Healing Ward totems, as keeping either totem up will prolong and complicate the fight.

**Paladin Tank PoV**

**Tips & Strategies**

* Hakkar is untauntable.
* Approximately every 20 seconds, Hakkar will cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_shadowworddominate.gif) Cause Insanity](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24327/cause-insanity) on its current aggro target which will mind-control them and cause them to temporarily lose aggro. Hakkar will then aggro on the player with the next highest threat until [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_shadowworddominate.gif) Cause Insanity](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24327/cause-insanity) expires on the mind-controlled tank, effectively making this a soft tank swap. Throughout the entirety of the fight, you and the other tank must be the top two on threat or else Hakkar will aggro on DPS and healers if one of the tanks gets mind-controlled.
* If you get afflicted with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_corpseexplode.gif) Corrupted Blood](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24328/corrupted-blood), reposition yourself away from any nearby melee DPS so that they do not get hit by it as well.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_corpseexplode.gif) Corrupted Blood](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24328/corrupted-blood) deals Shadow damage, so have priests buff everybody in the raid with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_antishadow.gif) Shadow Protection](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10958/shadow-protection) to increase the chance of partially mitigating damage ticks taken from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_corpseexplode.gif) Corrupted Blood](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24328/corrupted-blood).
* Before Hakkar casts his [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_lifedrain.gif) Blood Siphon](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24324/blood-siphon) ability, make sure you obtain the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_regenerate.gif) Poisonous Blood](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24321/poisonous-blood) debuff by stepping into the poison gas cloud that spawns after killing a [Son of Hakkar](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11357/son-of-hakkar). Each person without the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_regenerate.gif) Poisonous Blood](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24321/poisonous-blood) debuff during [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_lifedrain.gif) Blood Siphon](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24322/blood-siphon) will heal Hakkar for approximately 8000 health.

### Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj (AQ20)

*The Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj is a 20-man raid instance. The difficulty of this raid tier is generally considered to be above that of Molten Core and Zul'Gurub, as many boss and mob mechanics here cannot be brute-forced, instead requiring coordination from all players. Due to the 20-player cap, the threat potential of GBoK spam will be significantly reduced, so paladin tanks will have to increasingly rely upon their entire arsenal of abilities for threat and equip Spellpower-heavy gear such as the [Judgement Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=217/judgement-armor).*

**Tips & Strategies**

* This fight is a DPS check for the most part, particularly towards the end of the fight, as Kurinaxx enrages at 30% HP.
* As the fight will be relatively short due to high DPS, prioritize threat generation.
* The [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_criticalstrike.gif) Mortal Wound](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25646/mortal-wound) stacking debuff CANNOT be removed by [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_divineintervention.gif) Divine Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1020/divine-shield) nor [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofprotection.gif) Blessing of Protection](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10278/blessing-of-protection). If you have too many stacks, let the other tank take aggro until your stacks wear off. To force a temporary aggro switch in case the other tank has too many stacks, you can cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofprotection.gif) Blessing of Protection](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10278/blessing-of-protection).
* Watch out for [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_dust_02.gif) Sand Trap](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25656/sand-trap) that may spawn below you. Be prepared to reposition the boss so that you don't get hit by it.

**Tips & Strategies**

* Use Consecration to maintain aggro on adds that come during each wave.
* This encounter is a fairly long gauntlet, so it’s very easy to become OOM. Be sure to bring mana consumables.
* Have your DPS prioritize killing the Swarmguards before other mobs/minibosses due to their dangerous Whirlwinds.
* Rajaxx' AoE Knockback will cause a full threat reset to all those hit by it. Due to a lack of taunt, this can be an annoying ability to deal with as a paladin tank. However, this can be cheesed by having everybody get hit by his AoE knockback. Note that his AoE knockback ability hits everybody for 50% of their max HP.

**Tips & Strategies**

* This fight is a fairly straightforward DPS race. Prioritize threat generation.
* Moam does a mana drain on everybody, so you may need to use mana consumables.
* Have your priests/warlocks mana drain the boss. Moam casts an explosion if it reaches full mana, which effectively causes a wipe.
* If 90 seconds elapse during fight, three Arcane elementals will spawn that spam Arcane Explosion. Use GBoK spam to aggro them and move them away from raid. Have your warlocks banish as many elementals as possible.

**Tips & Strategies**

* With good coordination, this is the easiest boss in AQ20. Have all the eggs damaged until they're at 5k HP, then have the boss kited towards each egg and destroy the egg once Buru is directly standing above it.
* Every time an egg is destroyed, Buru will change aggro to a random player.
* Once all the eggs have been destroyed and/or Buru is at low HP, he will apply a powerful stacking debuff that will quickly wipe the raid if Buru isn't killed fast enough.

**Tips & Strategies**

* During Phase 1, Ayamiss is airborne, but you can maintain aggro by spamming GBoK.
* When Ayamiss lands, she has an aggro reset. Don’t bother building threat UNTIL she’s on the ground.
* Once Ayamiss lands, the fight turns into a quick tank and spank. Make sure that the DPS kill golden larva to avoid sacrifices.
* Try to tank Ayamiss at the base of the altar so that in case swarms of wasps spawn, you can quickly aggro them with Consecration.

Mobs in AQ20 have a MUCH higher aggro radius compared to mobs in dungeons and ZG. Their aggro radius appears to be about 25 to 35 yards. When you pull, make sure you move the packs back to avoid accidental chain pulls.   
Several of the trash mobs in AQ20 can be extremely deadly if not dealt with appropriately.[Anubisath Guardian](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15355/anubisath-guardian)

* These mobs are found in Watcher’s Terrace, where Ossirian is located. All 8 must be killed before engaging Ossirian, as the entire area must be used during the encounter. They only have 50k HP, but have several mechanics that can easily wipe raids.
* Each Guardian will randomly use two out of the four possible abilities: Plague, Meteor, Shadowbolt Volley, and Thunder Clap. Each of these abilities can easily wipe the raid if not dealt with correctly.
* Throughout the fight, the Guardian will spawn 2-3 mobs, including Swarmguards. Swarmguards must be tanked away from the raid due to their Whirlwinds or killed immediately.
* Anybody afflicted with the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_curseoftounges.gif) Plague Effect](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19594/plague-effect) debuff must immediately move 20 yards or more away from the raid.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_fireball02.gif) Meteor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=28884/meteor) damage can be mitigated by having two tightly stacked groups - one group for melee DPS and tanks, and the other group for range DPS and healers.
* When the Guardian is anywhere between 10k to 25k HP, they will either Enrage or begin to Explode. If the Guardian begins to explode, the raid must either kill him before it explodes, or run away at least 20 yards from the mob. The explosion deals about 4k-6k damage.

**Ayamiss Trash Packs**

* [Hive'Zara Stinger](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15327/hivezara-stinger) use an EXTREMELY DANGEROUS [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_charge.gif) Stinger Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25190/stinger-charge) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_charge.gif) Stinger Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25191/stinger-charge) abilities that deal very high amounts of Nature damage, from randing from 500 to 3.5k damage, which can easily kill your tanks.
* Have your raid DPS prioritize killing the Stingers first.
* Have a hunter or range DPS pull these packs -not a tank- as the player who pulls will likely get charged MULTIPLE times, which will more than likely result in death.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_charge.gif) Stinger Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25190/stinger-charge) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_charge.gif) Stinger Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25191/stinger-charge) do not have a minimum range, so the Stingers can charge anybody at melee range. The max range appears to be 25-30 yards.
* Damage from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_shadowbolt.gif) Shadow Bolt Volley](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25586/shadow-bolt-volley) can be mitigated with Shadow Protection Aura or Prayer of Shadow Protection.

**Tips & Strategies**

* Ossirian starts off with the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_curseoftounges.gif) Strength of Ossirian](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25176/strength-of-ossirian) buff (commonly referred to as Supreme Mode) which allows him to easily terminate tanks in one to two hits, even with Flask of the Titans. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_curseoftounges.gif) Strength of Ossirian](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25176/strength-of-ossirian) increases his damage by 300%.
* The pull is the trickiest part of the fight. You can use Divine Shield during the pull so that you don’t take damage from Ossirian while moving him to first crystal.
* Crystals have a 15-20 yard range and take about 3-5 seconds to activate after clicking on them. Once activated, the crystals temporariliy remove the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_curseoftounges.gif) Strength of Ossirian](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25176/strength-of-ossirian) buff from Ossirian for approximately 45 seconds. During this 45-second window, Ossirian is easily tankable, and must be kited by the tanks to the next crystal before he reenters Supreme Mode.
* Have a spotter guide you to the next crystals. Hunters or mounted players make for excellent spotters, as they can quickly search for spawned crystal nodes and ping them on the map.
* To ensure that tanks have a strong threat lead throughout the entire fight, don’t allow DPS to start until you have reached the SECOND crystal.
* Have your healers move AHEAD of you, not following you, as everybody is moving towards the next crystal.
* Take advantage of Ossirian’s [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_bullrush.gif) War Stomp](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25188/war-stomp) knockbacks so that they throw you into the next crystals.
* Ossirian will occasionally cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_cyclone.gif) Enveloping Winds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25189/enveloping-winds) on the current tank, forcing a temporary tank swap similar to Hakkar's Mind Control. Make sure all tanks are prepared to gain aggro on Ossirian and continue moving him towards crystals.

### Temple of Ahn'Qiraj (AQ40)

*The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj is a 40-man raid instance. and is the next raid tier after Blackwing Lair. The foes found within the depths of Ahn'Qiraj are numerous, vicious and cunning, and will push many guilds to their limit. Raid consumables are absolutely required at this point, and odds are that you will only be tanking this instance once you've proven yourself as a reliable tank in Blackwing Lair. Despite the challenges and handicaps present in this raid, paladins are more than capable of being viable tanks for the majority of encounters.*

Upcoming endgame content will be covered in future updates once reliable strategies for paladin tanks have been developed. Stay tuned!
