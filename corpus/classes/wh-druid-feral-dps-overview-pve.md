Viability of Feral Druid DPS in WoW Classic PvE Content
-------------------------------------------------------

Feral [![Druid](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_druid.gif) Druid](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=11/druid)s are a perfectly viable DPS spec across all vanilla content phases, but do not make the cut as a "meta spec" at the highest levels of competitive play. When powershifting effectively with [![Wolfshead Helm](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_04.gif) Wolfshead Helm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8345/wolfshead-helm) and utilizing full consumables (especially [![Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_14.gif) Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler)), a Feral DPS player can expect to fall within the middle of the pack of vanilla DPS specs on single target encounters in WoW Classic. In the absence of world buffs, Ferals rank pretty much neck and neck with [![Warlock](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warlock.gif) Warlock](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=9/warlock)s, [![Hunter](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_hunter.gif) Hunter](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=3/hunter)s, and Elemental [![Shaman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_shaman.gif) Shaman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=7/shaman)s for DPS on raid bosses, and *substantially* outperform the remaining hybrid specs: Shadow [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest)s, Enhancement [![Shaman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_shaman.gif) Shaman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=7/shaman)s, Balance [![Druid](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_druid.gif) Druid](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=11/druid)s, and Retribution [![Paladin](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_paladin.gif) Paladin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=2/paladin)s. On the flip side, the DPS output of a Feral will be capped at around 70% of that of an equivalently geared and skilled [![Rogue](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_rogue.gif) Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue) or Fire [![Mage](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_mage.gif) Mage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=8/mage), and the gap relative to a Fury [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) will be even larger.  
  
When compared to the first iteration of WoW Classic, Feral DPS is substantially worse off in comparison to other classes due to the removal of world buffs, which disproportionately benefited melee DPS over others. In Phase 3 of original Classic, for example, Ferals were the *third best DPS spec in the game* after Fury Warriors and Rogues by a handy margin, as they scaled far better with world buffs than Mages, Warlocks, and Hunters on the "target dummy" style boss fights in [Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair). Without world buffs, Feral DPS in WoW Classic is expected to be middle-of-the-pack even in BWL this time around, and you can no longer expect to dominate your ranged DPS friends on the meters in early raids.  
  
Based on the above rankings, it will never be worth bringing a pure DPS Feral (or "mono-cat") to a vanilla raid comp on the basis of their raw throughput alone, *if* you have access to a Warrior or Rogue who can fill that slot instead. However, it is important to emphasize that the *real* value of a Feral Druid in a vanilla raid team is their ability to flex between DPS and tanking as needed using the exact same talent build and gear. Given that bears are quite excellent tanks who can hold their own against Fury-Prot [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior)s in Threat generation while taking substantially less damage in the process, the fact that Feral DPS when not tanking is still quite respectable, despite not being top tier, makes the spec a great choice for filling any available off-tank slot in a raid team. Feral off-tanks will especially shine in "semi-hardcore" raid environments where both the high TPS and high EHP of the Feral will be of value when tanking, and where the DPS loss incurred from using a cat rather than another Warrior will not be consequential when the Feral is DPSing, compared to a hardcore speedrunning environment where any raid slot *not* filled by a Warrior constitutes a loss in clear time. **Note that the above assessment applies *only* for Ferals who embrace their hybrid raid role and wear [![Wolfshead Helm](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_04.gif) Wolfshead Helm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8345/wolfshead-helm) in their tank set so that they can DPS effectively when their tank target is dead: a Feral who does not powershift in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form) when not actively tanking a mob is a complete waste of a raid slot!**

### Strengths of Feral Druid DPS in WoW Classic

##### Dynamic and skill based DPS rotation

The Classic cat DPS rotation is arguably the most complex of all vanilla specs, and is extremely engaging to execute when compared to the "one button" rotations of Warlocks, Mages, and Rogues. The combination of the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofstamina.gif) Furor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17061/furor) talent with the quirky level 40 item [![Wolfshead Helm](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_04.gif) Wolfshead Helm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8345/wolfshead-helm) unlocks a uniquely Classic playstyle called "powershifting", which allows a cat Druid to convert their Mana pool into an instant Energy proc on demand simply by shifting out and back into [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form). This results in a dynamic DPS rotation that plays somewhat like a rhythm game, with the player alternating between dumping their Energy on special abilities, and then regenerating that Energy by powershifting at the optimal time. While powershifting can sound daunting to new players, it is actually a pretty straightforward rotation to learn, but still offers a lot of room for personal growth over time: playing Feral cat *well* is an achievable goal for every single player with just a bit of practice, but playing it *perfectly* requires on-the-fly thinking and fast reaction times in order to optimally react to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_manaburn.gif) Clearcasting](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16870/clearcasting) procs, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ghoulfrenzy.gif) Blood Frenzy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16953/blood-frenzy) procs, and partial Energy refunds from missed or dodged [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_vampiricaura.gif) Shred](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9830/shred) casts. Likewise, while the basics of powershifting have been well understood for years on vanilla private servers, there are still new nuances being worked out every month due to updated sim tools and a growing community of theorycrafters who are working on the spec. For example, it was just recently discovered that unlike the first iteration of WoW Classic, the optimal Feral rotation in WoW Classic will actually use a combination of both [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ghoulfrenzy.gif) Rip](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9896/rip) *and* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_ferociousbite.gif) Ferocious Bite](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22829/ferocious-bite) as finishing moves for dumping Combo Points.   
  
If the idea of mastering a nuanced DPS rotation for a spec that is still being actively optimized sounds like your cup of tea, then you will find playing a Feral Druid to be highly rewarding and well worth the onerous consumable requirements for performing competitively (at least one [![Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_14.gif) Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler) and [![Demonic Rune](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_rune_04.gif) Demonic Rune](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12662/demonic-rune) per boss pull in a raid, for example). On the flip side, if an engaging rotation is not a high priority for you, then you will be much better off playing a simpler class like a Rogue, which will let you save lots of weekly farming time and perform more competitively on the meters at the same time.

##### Hybrid gearing and role

Strictly speaking, Feral Druids are the only *truly* hybrid spec in Classic WoW, as they can perform two distinct roles (tanking and DPS) near-optimally with the exact same talents without making significant compromises to either role. No other class in Classic can do this, as talent trees for distinct roles are typically specialized enough that it is impossible to perform both roles optimally. In contrast, the Feral talent tree in vanilla is quite tightly optimized, with most of the beneficial cat and bear PvE talents consolidated together such that players do not need to focus on just one or the other at level 60. This means that the exact same talent build can be used for main tanking, off-tanking, and cat DPS, providing Feral Druids with the flexibility to fill in any of these roles as needed for a given raid team. Trash packs in vanilla raids typically require more tanks than boss encounters, so there are numerous single tank boss fights where off-tanks should DPS instead. Ferals excel in this role since cat DPS, although not competitive with top DPS classes like Fury Warriors and Rogues, is still very respectable and surpasses a number of other utility specs.  
  
Playing a hybrid role in raids is especially efficient for Ferals because a lot of the best tanking leather is also best in slot or close for DPS. For example, the Phase 1 BiS gear sets for [bear tanking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/feral/tank-bis-gear-pve-phase-4) and [cat DPS](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/wow-classic-feral-druid-dps-blackwing-lair-zg-best-in-slot-gear) in WoW Classic are pretty much *exactly the same*, differing materially in only the helm, cloak, and trinket slots. As such, a Feral off-tank simply needs to substitute [![Wolfshead Helm](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_04.gif) Wolfshead Helm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8345/wolfshead-helm) into their pure tank set in order to create a hybrid gear set with almost peak performance for both tanking and DPS simultaneously! This is especially useful on boss fights where the Druid is tanking only some of the time, such as when assigned to tank [Flamewaker Protector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12119/flamewaker-protector) and [Flamewaker Elite](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11664/flamewaker-elite) adds in the [Lucifron](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12118/lucifron) and [Gehennas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12259/gehennas) encounters, respectively, within [Molten Core](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2717/molten-core). In these situations, a Feral wearing tank gear + [![Wolfshead Helm](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_04.gif) Wolfshead Helm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8345/wolfshead-helm) can seamlessly shift from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_bearform.gif) Dire Bear Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9634/dire-bear-form) into [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form) once their add is dead in order to pump quite respectable DPS into the boss for the remainder of the fight.

### Weaknesses of Feral Druid DPS in WoW Classic

##### Mediocre gear scaling

Unlike bear TPS, which scales exceedingly well with the primary and secondary stats found on melee DPS gear, cat DPS exhibits quite mediocre gear scaling in comparison, paling relative to that of Fury Warriors and Rogues. The reason for this deficiency is threefold:  
  
**(1)** A Feral's extremely fast 1.0 second auto-attack speed in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form) indirectly nerfs the scaling of the primary special ability [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_vampiricaura.gif) Shred](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9830/shred) in the cat rotation: Shred scales 2.25 *x* with the damage done by each auto-attack, and a fast attack speed necessarily means that each auto-attack scales less strongly with Attack Power.  
  
**(2)** Despite its forced fast attack speed, the cat "paw weapon" is treated as a single wielded main hand weapon internally rather than a pair of dual wielded weapons like those of Fury Warriors and Rogues. Dual wielding substantially inflates the DPS contribution of Attack Power, Hit, and Crit on gear. The other three single wielding melee specs, Enhancement [![Shaman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_shaman.gif) Shaman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=7/shaman)s, Retribution [![Paladin](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_paladin.gif) Paladin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=2/paladin)s, and Arms [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior)s, also exhibit abysmal gear scaling for this reason, with the first two scaling far worse than even cats due to their lack of an analogue to powershifting for artificially boosting their stat scaling from special abilities to compensate.  
  
**(3)** Since the cat "paw weapon" is treated as its own weapon class, Ferals cannot benefit from Weapon Skill bonuses to Sword, Mace, Axe, and Dagger weapons from racials or items like [![Edgemaster's Handguards](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_30.gif) Edgemaster's Handguards](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14551/edgemasters-handguards) and [![Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_23.gif) Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18823/aged-core-leather-gloves). Bonus weapon skill is easily the strongest melee DPS stat in vanilla WoW, as it is the only way to mitigate glancing blows on auto-attacks and *also* provides Hit Chance. Since there is no analogue to +Daggers for the Feral paw weapon, cats are stuck dealing with the full 35% damage reduction on glances, which constitute 40% of their total melee attacks!

##### Limited PvE itemization

Compounding the lackluster gear scaling of cat DPS in vanilla is the fact that there is hardly any PvE gear available for Feral Druids to scale *with*! Just like every other hybrid spec in vanilla, Ferals lack any dedicated Tier sets and must instead rely on a small handful of off-piece upgrades from each raid for their PvE gear progression. Moreover, early Blizzard developers did not at all understand how to properly itemize off-piece leather for Ferals, so many of the options that *do* exist spend their stat allocation very inefficiently. For example, compare the stat allocation on the Druid off-set from [Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair) ([![Taut Dragonhide Shoulderpads](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_08.gif) Taut Dragonhide Shoulderpads](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19389/taut-dragonhide-shoulderpads), [![Taut Dragonhide Belt](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_16.gif) Taut Dragonhide Belt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19396/taut-dragonhide-belt) , and [![Taut Dragonhide Gloves](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_19.gif) Taut Dragonhide Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19390/taut-dragonhide-gloves)) with that on the corresponding Rogue Tier 2 pieces ([![Bloodfang Spaulders](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_23.gif) Bloodfang Spaulders](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16832/bloodfang-spaulders), [![Bloodfang Belt](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_23.gif) Bloodfang Belt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16910/bloodfang-belt), and [![Bloodfang Gloves](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_21.gif) Bloodfang Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16907/bloodfang-gloves)). Considering that 1 Strength is equivalent to 2.4 AP in DPS value for cats (or 2.64 with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_magearmor.gif) Blessing of Kings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20217/blessing-of-kings)), and that 1 Agility is worth 2.51 AP equivalent (or 2.76 with Kings), it is quite apparent that the raw Attack Power found on the Taut Dragonhide pieces pales in comparison to the equivalent AP on the Bloodfang set. As a result, until the release of AQ40 in Phase 5, PvP rewards are the only source of high quality DPS gear for Ferals during the first half of WoW Classic. If you do not intend to grind out any PvP ranking or reputation rewards, then you will be stuck wearing pre-raid gear like the [Devilsaur Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=143/devilsaur-armor) set and [![Truestrike Shoulders](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_10.gif) Truestrike Shoulders](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12927/truestrike-shoulders) all the way until Phase 4! In practice, this means that a sweaty cat DPS player may be able to give the Rogues in their raid team a run for their money on the meters in the first half of WoW Classic, but will start falling further and further behind over time due to growing discrepancies in the quality of available gear plus the intrinsic differences in the scaling of the two specs.

##### Lack of cleave damage

While the single target DPS of Feral Druids in Classic WoW is respectable, their multi-target output is absolutely abysmal in both vanilla and TBC. Feral cats lack any AoE or cleave abilities in their toolkit, so their multi-target rotation is exactly the same as the single-target rotation, with targets focused down one at a time. This deficiency does not matter very much in guilds that are raiding casually or focusing on boss parses, as it primarily impacts DPS output on trash mobs. In a competitive speedrun setting, however, trash constitutes the majority of time spent clearing the instance and is usually pulled in sizable packs, so a lack of cleave damage cripples the value of a Feral cat in that context. As a result, even when bringing a Feral Druid who will primarily DPS on boss fights, it is best to leverage the Feral as a tank rather than as a pure DPS for trash.

---

Class Mechanics for Feral Druid DPS in WoW Classic
--------------------------------------------------

##### Energy

Energy is the primary resource used by Feral Druids when DPSing. Unlike Mana, which is both consumed and regenerated very slowly on the timescale of a full encounter, Energy is regenerated and dumped extremely quickly similar to Rage. Unlike Rage, however, the base rate of Energy generation is constant and not tied to outgoing or incoming damage. In Classic WoW, Energy is regenerated on a fixed 2 second tick, with 20 Energy gained each tick up to a maximum of 100. This tick operates independently from player casts / GCDs, but in practice, the DPS rotation syncs up with the tick cycle since the player will often need to wait for a tick prior to casting their next ability. The Energy regeneration mechanic places a hard limit on the frequency with which special abilities can be cast by Rogues or cats, *unless* the regeneration rate can be manipulated somehow (see below).

##### Powershifting

Powershifting is *the* mechanic which makes Feral DPS competitive with other classes, and is the most important technique to master when playing a Feral Druid for the first time. The idea behind powershifting is to circumvent the standard limitation on cast frequency for Energy users by enhancing the Energy regeneration rate beyond the standard tick of 20 Energy every 2 seconds. Feral Druids leverage two unique and powerful tools which synergize to make this possible: (1) the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofstamina.gif) Furor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17061/furor) talent, which instantly generates 40 Energy when shifting into cat form, and (2) the quirky level 40 item [![Wolfshead Helm](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_04.gif) Wolfshead Helm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8345/wolfshead-helm), which boosts this from 40 to 60 Energy each shift. This means that when a Feral Druid has expended all of their Energy, rather than waiting for 4 seconds (2 Energy ticks) to regenerate enough Energy for another cast, the Druid can instead shift out of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form) and then back into [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form) to end up with 60 Energy right away. In vanilla and TBC, canceling a shapeshift form does not incur a global cooldown, but shifting *into* a form does incur a 1.5 second GCD. Therefore, a powershift effectively generates Energy at a rate of 40 Energy per second, which is 4 times higher than a standard Energy tick! Moreover, since the shift can be performed instantaneously with the help of a powershift macro, the server never "sees" you out of form and the cat swing timer just proceeds as usual.  
  
A typical powershift cycle is illustrated below using the example of two [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_vampiricaura.gif) Shred](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9830/shred) casts, each costing 48 energy:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Time in seconds** | **Action/Event** | **Final Energy** |
| 0 | Powershift | 60 |
| 1 | Energy Tick | 80 |
| 1.5 | GCD ends, cast Shred | 32 |
| 2.5 | GCD ends, wait | 32 |
| 3 | Energy Tick | 52 |
| 3 | Cast Shred | 4 |
| 4 | GCD ends, powershift | 60 |

This cycle allows 2 Shreds to be cast every 4 seconds, with only 4 energy wasted each cycle. In contrast, if we wanted to cast two Shreds the conventional way without powershifting, the DPS cycle starting at the end of the above would look like this:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Time in seconds** | **Action/Event** | **Final Energy** |
| 0 | GCD ends, wait | 4 |
| 1 | Energy Tick | 24 |
| 3 | Energy Tick | 44 |
| 5 | Energy Tick | 64 |
| 5 | Cast Shred | 16 |
| 6 | GCD ends, wait | 16 |
| 7 | Energy Tick | 36 |
| 9 | Energy Tick | 56 |
| 9 | Cast Shred | 8 |
| 10 | GCD ends, wait | 8 |

Notice that without powershifting, it takes 10 seconds to cast the same 2 Shreds! This is why powershifting is such a critical tool for Feral DPS: it more than doubles the rate at which special abilities can be cast.

##### Mana Management

Powershifting is the key tool which enables the Feral DPS rotation, but it also costs a lot of Mana. At level 60, each powershift incurs a baseline cost of 684 Mana, and since shifts can occur as often as every 4 seconds, this can very quickly deplete a Feral Druid's small Mana pool, since cats wear pure melee DPS gear with no Intellect on it aside from the small quantities found on the PvP ranking sets. For this reason, taking all three points in the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Natural Shapeshifter](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16835/natural-shapeshifter) talent is non-negotiable for all Ferals, even those who primarily tank and DPS infrequently! Unfortunately, talenting 3/3 [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Natural Shapeshifter](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16835/natural-shapeshifter) is not sufficient on its own for sustaining a powershift rotation over typical fight lengths, so Ferals must supplement the talent with efficient usage of Mana consumables and cooldowns.  
  
Mana users in Classic WoW can take advantage of both the potion cooldown and the Healthstone cooldown for Mana regeneration. For maximum uptime, a [![Dark Rune](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_sealofkings.gif) Dark Rune](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20520/dark-rune) or [![Demonic Rune](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_rune_04.gif) Demonic Rune](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12662/demonic-rune) should be popped as soon as your Mana drops to 1500 below max, so as to start the cooldown ticking quickly without wasting any Mana. Once your Rune is used, then continue to execute the powershifting rotation until you are 2250 Mana below your maximum Mana pool, at which point you should pop a [![Major Mana Potion](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_76.gif) Major Mana Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13444/major-mana-potion). Note that these consumables cannot be used in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form), but can be integrated into powershift macros so that no unnecessary GCDs are wasted. Finally, use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_lightning.gif) Innervate](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=29166/innervate) when you are close to running completely out of Mana. Note that unlike TBC, where Feral Druids can afford to "give away" their Innervate to other raid members (most commonly an Arcane [![Mage](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_mage.gif) Mage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=8/mage)), *saving your own Innervate for personal use is absolutely essential to DPS sustainably in vanilla raids*.

#### Alliance

The only race option for Alliance Druids is Night Elf. As mentioned in the Mana Management section above, Alliance is by far the superior faction for Feral DPS players, as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_righteousnessaura.gif) Judgement of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20355/judgement-of-wisdom) on its own can be the difference between running out of Mana just a minute into a pull versus being able to powershift sustainably for the entirety of a 3-4 minute boss kill. To add insult to injury, Alliance cats possess a higher Mana pool due to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_magearmor.gif) Blessing of Kings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20217/blessing-of-kings), and even *more* bonus Mana regen from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofwisdom.gif) Blessing of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19854/blessing-of-wisdom).

#### Horde

The only race option for Horde Druids is Tauren. Due to the serious Mana issues faced by Horde cats, it is recommended for Horde Ferals to shy away from a pure cat DPS role and prioritize tanking in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_bearform.gif) Dire Bear Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9634/dire-bear-form) as much as possible over the course of a raid.

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Shadowmeld](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20580/shadowmeld): Activate to slip into the shadows, reducing the chance for enemies to detect your presence. Lasts until cancelled or upon moving. Night Elf Rogues and Druids with Shadowmeld are more difficult to detect while stealthed or prowling.

The only Night Elf racial ability that provides any value for Feral DPS in a raid environment is [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritarmor.gif) Nature Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20583/nature-resistance), as the AQ40 raid in Phase 5 includes two encounters, [Princess Huhuran](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15509/princess-huhuran) and [Viscidus](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15299/viscidus), where NR is helpful on all DPS players to reduce overall damage intake on the raid.

### Horde Races for Feral Druid DPS in WoW Classic

#### [Tauren Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren)

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_flower_01.gif) Cultivation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20552/cultivation): Herbalism skill increased by 15.

In addition to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritarmor.gif) Nature Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20551/nature-resistance), which provides the same PvE value as it does for Night Elves, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Endurance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20550/endurance) is an amazing PvE racial that scales multiplicatively with every other source of increased health from consumables and raid buffs, including flat health buffs like [![Flask of the Titans](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_62.gif) Flask of the Titans](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13510/flask-of-the-titans). The health boost is useful not only when tanking, where it amplifies the already high health pool of bears, but also when DPSing in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form), since early WoW Classic raids have been buffed with new raid-wide damage mechanics that are especially dangerous to cats due to the very low Stamina levels on pre-raid Feral DPS gear.

---

Specializations for Feral Druid DPS in WoW Classic
--------------------------------------------------

Feral Druids specialize deep into the Feral tree, with only a limited number of talent points spent elsewhere. This section will describe the overall benefits of each tree in the context of cat DPS.

##### Balance

The Balance tree contains a number of valuable talents for Feral cats. Most importantly, the straight 10% total damage boost from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_staff_01.gif) Natural Weapons](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16906/natural-weapons) is mandatory and worth many other talents combined. In addition, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_crystalball.gif) Omen of Clarity](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16864/omen-of-clarity) is also a great DPS talent, as Omen procs translate directly into more special abilities that can be cast within each powershift cycle. Finally, taking [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Natural Shapeshifter](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16835/natural-shapeshifter) is a requirement for *all* Ferals, as even main tanks should be spending a decent chunk of time throughout a raid DPSing in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form) when their tank target is dead, and the talent is necessary to powershift sustainably without running out of Mana prematurely.

##### Feral

The overwhelming majority of useful talents for Feral druid tanking and DPS are found in the Feral tree. The vanilla Feral tree is tightly optimized with lots of overlapping cat and bear talents, so the exact same build can be used for both roles without making significant compromises to either one. For DPS specifically, the most important mandatory talents are [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_vampiricaura.gif) Improved Shred](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16968/improved-shred), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_monsterclaw_04.gif) Sharpened Claws](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16944/sharpened-claws), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_hunter_pet_cat.gif) Predatory Strikes](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16975/predatory-strikes), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofagility.gif) Heart of the Wild](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24894/heart-of-the-wild), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Leader of the Pack](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17007/leader-of-the-pack). The presence of so many highly impactful talents deep into the Feral tree constrains any Feral talent build to invest heavily in this tree rather than hybridizing. Lower impact DPS talents are [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_ability_druid_demoralizingroar.gif) Feral Aggression](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16862/feral-aggression) (since [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_ferociousbite.gif) Ferocious Bite](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22829/ferocious-bite) is cast infrequently in the DPS rotation) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ghoulfrenzy.gif) Blood Frenzy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16954/blood-frenzy) (since the extra Combo Points do not always translate into added DPS). Technically, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_faeriefire.gif) Faerie Fire (Feral)](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16857/faerie-fire-feral) can be omitted if a Balance or Restoration druid is consistently present in the raid group, but it is recommended not to skip it.

##### Restoration

An optimized Feral talent build will take only 5 points in the Restoration tree for maxing out the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofstamina.gif) Furor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17061/furor) talent. The primary purpose of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofstamina.gif) Furor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17061/furor) is to unlock the Feral DPS powershifting rotation in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form), so it is mandatory for *all* Ferals to talent it in order to be able to DPS effectively when not actively tanking a mob. The Restoration tree also contains the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_enrage.gif) Improved Enrage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17082/improved-enrage) talent that is a nice quality of life boost for bear tanks, but it unfortunately cannot be taken in any competitively viable talent build due to a lack of available talent points after accounting for other mandatory tanking and DPS talents.

### Best PvE Spec for Feral Druid DPS in WoW Classic

The best PvE talent build for Feral Druids is **14/32/5**, and is optimized for both tanking and DPS simultaneously without compromising significantly on either front. There are a few variants of the build that are covered in our [Classic Feral Druid DPS Talents & Builds Guide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/feral/dps-talent-builds-pve), but these differ only in the choice of whether to max out the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_hunter_pet_hyena.gif) Ferocity](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16938/ferocity) talent or the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_ability_druid_demoralizingroar.gif) Feral Aggression](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16862/feral-aggression) talent. For tank focused players, two further variations are possible if you opt to forego 2/5 [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_ability_druid_demoralizingroar.gif) Feral Aggression](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16859/feral-aggression) in favor of 1-2 points in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pelt_bear_03.gif) Thick Hide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16930/thick-hide) and/or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_cannibalize.gif) Primal Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16961/primal-fury), as covered in our [Classic Feral Druid Tank Talents & Builds Guide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/feral/tank-talent-builds-pve). Besides these limited variations, the build takes every single Feral talent besides [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritwolf.gif) Feline Swiftness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24866/feline-swiftness) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_bash.gif) Brutal Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16941/brutal-impact), both of which are PvP / open world talents that do not benefit your PvE performance in raids. Every other talent in the Feral tree provides either DPS or tanking value and should be taken for PvE, since one of the primary benefits of Feral Druids in Classic raids is the ability to perform either role equally well. The most important talents for DPS specifically are listed in the "Feral" section above.  
  
Outside of the Feral tree, this build takes [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofstamina.gif) Furor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17061/furor), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_staff_01.gif) Natural Weapons](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16906/natural-weapons), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Natural Shapeshifter](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16835/natural-shapeshifter), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_crystalball.gif) Omen of Clarity](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16864/omen-of-clarity). These talents encompass everything in the Restoration and Balance trees that is essential for Feral tanking and DPS, and require "wasting" only 5 talent points on [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_abolishmagic.gif) Improved Wrath](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16818/improved-wrath) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_natureswrath.gif) Improved Nature's Grasp](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17249/improved-natures-grasp) for progressing through the Balance tree. As such, besides these 5 filler points, this build lacks a single talent that doesn't directly benefit the PvE performance of a Feral Druid, which is a testament to how tightly optimized the Feral talent tree is in Classic WoW. Additionally, most of the key cat talents are also key bear talents: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_monsterclaw_04.gif) Sharpened Claws](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16944/sharpened-claws), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_hunter_pet_cat.gif) Predatory Strikes](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16975/predatory-strikes), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_faeriefire.gif) Faerie Fire (Feral)](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16857/faerie-fire-feral), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofagility.gif) Heart of the Wild](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24894/heart-of-the-wild), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Leader of the Pack](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17007/leader-of-the-pack), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_staff_01.gif) Natural Weapons](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16906/natural-weapons), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_crystalball.gif) Omen of Clarity](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16864/omen-of-clarity).

Best Professions for Classic Feral Druid DPS
--------------------------------------------

### [Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Engineering is an absolute must-have if you are trying to go the extra mile in PvE or PvP. In PvE, one of the highest impact consumables available to Feral Druids (after [![Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_14.gif) Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler) and Mana consumables of course) is [![Goblin Sapper Charge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Sapper Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge), which requires Goblin Engineering to craft but can be used by Engineers of either specialization. Sappers are especially useful in a speedrun environment as a strong DPS cooldown on AoE trash packs, and partially compensate for the lack of any viable AoE damage abilities in the vanilla Feral toolkit. Many boss encounters also include multiple adds that spawn alongside the boss, and the combined DPS added by a Sapper across all targets can even surpass the contribution of staple consumables like [![Elixir of the Mongoose](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_32.gif) Elixir of the Mongoose](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13452/elixir-of-the-mongoose)!  
  
Engineering is also the source of the absolute best DPS trinket in the entire game: [![Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_polymorphchicken.gif) Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10725/gnomish-battle-chicken), which requires the Gnomish specialization to craft. The [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_birdbeck_01.gif) Battle Squawk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23060/battle-squawk) buff provided by the [Battle Chicken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=8836/battle-chicken) scales multiplicatively with the Haste from [![Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_14.gif) Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler), and is worth close to 70 AP in value for personal DPS. But critically, the Haste buff applies to your entire party, making the total raid DPS impact of the chicken quite enormous. Furthermore, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_birdbeck_01.gif) Battle Squawk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23060/battle-squawk) buffs from multiple chickens can be stacked and scale multiplicatively with one another, so it is optimal for every party member to use their [![Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_polymorphchicken.gif) Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10725/gnomish-battle-chicken) at the same time when progressing through raids. Recently, a [reliable method](https://tbc.wowhead.com/news/guaranteed-battle-squawk-trigger-in-burning-crusade-classic-324632) has been discovered for securing guaranteed [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_birdbeck_01.gif) Battle Squawk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23060/battle-squawk) procs, making the [![Engineering](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=202/engineering) profession even more essential for competitive raiders.

### [Blacksmithing](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/blacksmithing-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Blacksmithing is required for crafting the very useful utility trinket [![Glimmering Mithril Insignia](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_02.gif) Glimmering Mithril Insignia](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10418/glimmering-mithril-insignia), and must be permanently trained in order to equip and use the trinket. Horde Ferals will get the most use out of this trinket due to the lack of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_excorcism.gif) Fear Ward](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=6346/fear-ward) for mitigating Fear mechanics in Horde raids. Fears are especially detrimental when tanking raid bosses, as they cause the boss to temporarily swap targets to the next highest person on Threat until you regain control of your character, but also significantly reduce your personal DPS in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form) by reducing your active uptime on the boss. The following are examples of vanilla raid bosses with Fear mechanics that can be mitigated using a combination of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_excorcism.gif) Fear Ward](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=6346/fear-ward) / [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_tremortotem.gif) Tremor Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=8143/tremor-totem) and [![Glimmering Mithril Insignia](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_02.gif) Glimmering Mithril Insignia](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10418/glimmering-mithril-insignia) in order to squeeze out more DPS and improve your parse: [Onyxia](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=10184/onyxia), [Magmadar](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11982/magmadar), [Nefarian](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11583/nefarian), [Princess Yauj](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15543/princess-yauj), and [Gluth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15932/gluth). Outside of its PvE value, the Blacksmithing trinket is also extremely useful in PvP, for example when carrying flags in Warsong Gulch.  
  
Blacksmithing also provides a big quality of life benefit for Ferals by allowing you to craft and apply your own [![Iron Counterweight](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_orb_01.gif) Iron Counterweight](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6043/iron-counterweight)s to your Pummelers. Counterweights are worth over 40 AP equivalent in value for cat DPS, making them easily worth the effort and gold to craft. Somewhat counterintuitively, the 3% Haste buff applies to your melee attacks while shapeshifted, and scales multiplicatively with the 50% Haste from MCP. Counterweights are also quite cheap to craft (especially when compared to the "true BiS" 25 Agility enchant), so it is actually practical to apply one to each of your Pummelers every week without breaking the bank.
