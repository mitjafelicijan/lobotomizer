Viability of Warrior Tanks in Classic Fresh PvE Content
-------------------------------------------------------

The Protection [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) is considered the best tank in Classic World of Warcraft, due to both its inherent strengths and the relative weakness of other tanks as a result of development choices for hybrid classes, namely Feral [![Druid](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_druid.gif) Druid](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=11/druid) and Protection [![Paladin](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_paladin.gif) Paladin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=2/paladin).  
The [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) class overall is the uncontested winner of Classic World of Warcraft when it comes to class development, with incredible damage output, threat and survival thanks to an exceptional scaling on power increases. And vanilla World of Warcraft is known for its absurd amount of cumulative buffs and consumables!  
  
Thanks to a variety of builds and gear choices, it can both fulfill the role of a very sturdy tank able to withstand the assault of deadly bosses or become a threat machine with incredible damage output for a tank class.  
Most raids will pick a Protection [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) for its superior avoidance and lower incoming damage when wearing defensive gear, as well as their unique defensive cooldowns.   
At the other end of the spectrum, speedrunning guilds will however favor the more offensive Fury Prot tank variant for its very high threat and damage output. The explosive snap threat of the Fury Prot [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) is essential to enable high damage dealers when speed and efficiency are a priority for your raid.

### Strengths of Warrior Tanks in Classic Fresh PvE Content

##### Exceptional scaling

Due to the rage resource, the [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) scales exponentially with power increases. More damage yields more rage, which in turn yields more ability usage, proccing more buffs such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ghoulfrenzy.gif) Flurry](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12974/flurry) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofstrength.gif) Holy Strength](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20007/holy-strength), further increasing your damage. This cycle is exacerbated by the copious amount of buffs and consumables used in raids.  
The virtuous circle of rage generation and self buffs, paired with the rage from incoming damage as a tank, means the [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank has a very high ability usage which converts to exceptional threat compared to other tank classes.

##### High damage output

For the reasons described above, a [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank not only provides great threat but also a very high damage output for a tank relative to other classes capable in that role.

##### Versatility

A [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank specialized in the fury tree can very easily swap from a tank to a DPS role at the click of a button to change gear and become a very competent damage dealer whenever its shield isn't needed. This is particularly convenient for off-tanks in raids, where tanking assignments can vary heavily from one boss with many adds to handle, to another with work for one tank only.

##### Defensive and offensive cooldowns

Another strength of the [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank is the access to defensive cooldowns in the form of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_ashestoashes.gif) Last Stand](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12975/last-stand) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_shieldwall.gif) Shield Wall](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=871/shield-wall) that can singlehandedly prevent a wipe when used as a panic button, or even be planned around to bypass certain boss mechanics. But the [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank can also access offensive cooldowns to increase its threat output when it matters the most, such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_deathpact.gif) Death Wish](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12328/death-wish) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_criticalstrike.gif) Recklessness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1719/recklessness). And even pair them together, such as using [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_deathpact.gif) Death Wish](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12328/death-wish) alongside [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_ashestoashes.gif) Last Stand](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12975/last-stand) to offset the increased damage taken with a bigger health pool.

### Weaknesses of Warrior Tanks in Classic Fresh PvE Content

##### Lack of AoE threat

The [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank is lacking in the AoE department due to stance restrictions. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_thunderclap.gif) Thunder Clap](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11581/thunder-clap) can only be used in Battle Stance while [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_whirlwind.gif) Whirlwind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1680/whirlwind) requires Berserker Stance, both of which are hardly worth using because they will make you lose all your rage. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_warcry.gif) Demoralizing Shout](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11556/demoralizing-shout) provides abysmal threat so you are left with only single target abilities baring the occasional [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_cleave.gif) Cleave](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20569/cleave) with excess rage, which makes tanking larger packs of mobs in dungeons a hassle.  
Thankfully, you will only ever be tasked to tank single targets for the entirety of the raid content!

##### Gear Dependant

A [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior)'s scaling comes not only from buffs but also from gear upgrades, which are usually very contested due to the popularity of the Warrior class in Classic World of Warcraft. [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior)s especially rely on weapon upgrades which are often the rarest and most coveted items in raids.

### Best Race for Alliance Warrior Tanks

#### [Human Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) Warrior

Human is uncontestably the best race for a Warrior in PvE in the Alliance because of their incredible racials, namely [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_meleedamage.gif) Sword Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20597/sword-specialization) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_05.gif) Mace Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20864/mace-specialization). Weapon skill bonuses are very valuable for your damage output and threat generation and, coincidentally, every single best tank (and DPS) weapon in the game for a warrior happens to be either a sword or a mace, including the iconic and dream of all tanks [![Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_sword_39.gif) Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker).  
By reducing the difference between your weapon skill and the defense skill of bosses, these racials reduce your chances to miss with your attacks and reduce the damage penalty of glancing blows that represent 40% of your normal hits against raid bosses. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_note_02.gif) Diplomacy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20599/diplomacy) is also a nice bonus when grinding early reputations for items or patterns.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_meleedamage.gif) Sword Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20597/sword-specialization): Skill with Swords and Two-Handed Swords increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_05.gif) Mace Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20864/mace-specialization): Skill with Maces and Two-Handed Maces increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_note_02.gif) Diplomacy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20599/diplomacy): Reputation gains increased by 10%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20600/perception): Dramatically increases stealth detection for 20 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_shardbrilliantsmall.gif) The Human Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20598/the-human-spirit): Spirit increased by 5%.

#### [Night Elf Night Elf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=4/night-elf) Warrior

The Night Elf race technically brings minimal advantage to a Tank with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_shadowmeld.gif) Quickness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20582/quickness) and a slightly higher base Agility, but these pale in comparison to [![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human)'s weapon skill bonuses equivalent to several items worth of threat and damage increase.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_shadowmeld.gif) Quickness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20582/quickness): Dodge chance increased by 1%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Shadowmeld](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20580/shadowmeld): Activate to slip into the shadows, reducing the chance for enemies to detect your presence. Lasts until cancelled or upon moving. Night Elf Rogues and Druids with Shadowmeld are more difficult to detect while stealthed or prowling.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritarmor.gif) Nature Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20583/nature-resistance): Nature Resistance increased by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Wisp Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20585/wisp-spirit): Transform into a wisp upon death, increasing movement speed by 50%.

#### [Dwarf Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) Warrior

Dwarves come with a very niche racial that can be somewhat useful as a tank in the form of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform), which can be used as a minor cooldown to increase your armor briefly, or in rare cases to become immune to poison effects. Similar to Night Elf, the Dwarf racials pale in comparison to [![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human)'s for a Warrior.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform): While active, grants immunity to Bleed, Poison, and Disease effects. In addition, Armor increased by 10%. Lasts 8 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_dwarf_findtreasure.gif) Find Treasure](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2481/find-treasure): Allows the dwarf to sense nearby treasure, making it appear on the minimap
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_wizardmark.gif) Frost Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20596/frost-resistance): Increases Frost Resistance by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_musket_03.gif) Gun Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20595/gun-specialization): Guns skill increased by 5.

#### [Gnome Gnome](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=7/gnome) Warrior

Gnomes are considered the best Alliance PvP race for Warrior thanks to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_trip.gif) Escape Artist](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20589/escape-artist) removing all movement impairing effects, such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_frostnova.gif) Frost Nova](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10230/frost-nova) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_stranglevines.gif) Entangling Roots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9853/entangling-roots) which are your biggest weakness, but none of the racials benefit the class in PvE.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_trip.gif) Escape Artist](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20589/escape-artist): Escape the effects of any immobilization or movement speed reduction effect.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Arcane Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20592/arcane-resistance): Arcane Resistance increased.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gear_01.gif) Engineering Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20593/engineering-specialization): Engineering skill increased by 15.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_essenceeternallarge.gif) Expansive Mind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20591/expansive-mind): Intelligence increased by 5%.

### Best Race for Horde Warrior Tank

#### [Troll Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) Warrior

Troll is the best race for a main-tank only. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_troll_berserk.gif) Berserking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20554/berserking) is an amazing racial that can be used as an extra trinket for an on-demand attack speed boost, greatly increasing your threat generation at the beginning of a boss fight. However, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_troll_berserk.gif) Berserking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20554/berserking) isn't as strong when it comes to DPS, which would make [![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) a better choice for a versatile off-tank often tasked to DPS.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_troll_berserk.gif) Berserking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20554/berserking): Increases your casting and attack speed by 10% to 30%. At full health, the speed increase is 10% with a greater effect up to 30% if you are badly hurt when you activate Berserking. Lasts 10 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pelt_bear_ruin_02.gif) Beast Slaying](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20557/beast-slaying): Damage dealt versus Beasts increased by 5%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_bow_12.gif) Bow Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=26290/bow-specialization): Skill with Bow Weapons increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_throwingaxe_03.gif) Throwing Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20558/throwing-specialization): Skill with Throwing Weapons increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_regenerate.gif) Regeneration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20555/regeneration): Health regeneration rate increased by 10%. 10% of total Health regeneration may continue during combat.

#### [Orc Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) Warrior

While not as strong as [![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human)'s weapon racials because the amount of axes available in raids is more limited, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_02.gif) Axe Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20574/axe-specialization) greatly increases your threat and damage output when wielding an axe. Not the best for a tank that will prefer to wield swords or daggers in most cases, but essential for an accomplished off-tank to maximize their DPS when not actively tanking or to wield utility weapons such as [![Annihilator](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_12.gif) Annihilator](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12798/annihilator) and [![Nightfall](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_12.gif) Nightfall](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19169/nightfall).  
The weapon skill bonus, paired with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_orc_berserkerstrength.gif) Blood Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20572/blood-fury) that can be used as an additional DPS trinket, makes Orc the best race for fury and off-tank warriors alike.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_02.gif) Axe Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20574/axe-specialization): Skill with Axes and Two-Handed Axes increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_orc_berserkerstrength.gif) Blood Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20572/blood-fury): Increases base melee attack power by 25% for 15 sec and reduces healing effects on you by 50% for 25 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_23.gif) Hardiness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20573/hardiness): Chance to resist Stun effects increased by an additional 25%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_warcry.gif) Command](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20575/command): Damage dealt by Hunter and Warlock pets increased by 5%.

#### [Tauren Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren) Warrior

Tauren is an okay choice for a more conservative approach to tanking, with a small HP increase from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Endurance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20550/endurance) and a niche CC ability in the form of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warstomp.gif) War Stomp](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20549/war-stomp) that is mostly limited to dungeons and PvP. Due to the absence of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofsalvation.gif) Blessing of Salvation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1038/blessing-of-salvation) Horde side, threat has always been the name of the game so offensive choices such as [![Troll](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_troll_male.gif) Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) and [![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) are usually preferred for a tank.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Endurance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20550/endurance): Total Health increased by 5%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warstomp.gif) War Stomp](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20549/war-stomp): Stuns up to 5 enemies within 8 yds for 2 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_flower_01.gif) Cultivation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20552/cultivation): Herbalism skill increased by 15.

#### [Undead Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) Warrior

The Undead race is a very niche choice for a Tank because its only advantage in PvE is [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_raisedead.gif) Will of the Forsaken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=7744/will-of-the-forsaken) which is redundant with a Warrior's innate ability to break fear effects in multiple ways and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_tremortotem.gif) Tremor Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=8143/tremor-totem) already taking care of fears in most cases.

#### Racial Bonuses

Warrior Tank Specializations in Classic Fresh
---------------------------------------------

A [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank can specialize in two different end-game builds, known respectively as Deep Prot and Fury Prot.  
The former focuses on taking advantage of your shield to produce threat while wearing mainly mitigation-oriented gear. The latter focuses on producing as much threat as possible via raw damage to provide a high threat ceiling and enable the damage dealers in your raid.

**Deep Prot specialization**

The Deep Prot specialization is your cookie-cutter Sword and Board tank archetype played with a shield, with emblematic spells of this role such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shield_05.gif) Shield Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23925/shield-slam) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_defend.gif) Shield Block](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2565/shield-block). As the name implies, this spec invests deeply in the  **Protection** tree to unlock [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shield_05.gif) Shield Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23925/shield-slam), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_sword_20.gif) One-Handed Weapon Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16542/one-handed-weapon-specialization) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_thunderbolt.gif) Concussion Blow](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12809/concussion-blow). The remainder of the points are spent in the arms and fury trees to increase your threat with talents such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_eviscerate.gif) Cruelty](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12856/cruelty) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_ambush.gif) Improved Heroic Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12664/improved-heroic-strike), and your avoidance with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_parry.gif) Deflection](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16466/deflection).

**Fury Prot specialization**

The Fury Prot specialization is the more offensive variant of the Warrior tank builds, aiming to produce threat via raw damage and sometimes dual-wielding weapons, thus focusing on the  **Fury** talents tree. It relies on a more offensive gear to take advantage of scaling talents such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholyfrenzy.gif) Enrage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=13048/enrage), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ghoulfrenzy.gif) Flurry](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12974/flurry), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_dualwield.gif) Dual Wield Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23587/dual-wield-specialization) and the signature spells of the Fury playstyle, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_bloodlust.gif) Bloodthirst](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23894/bloodthirst) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_deathpact.gif) Death Wish](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12328/death-wish). The remainder of the points are spent in the Protection tree to unlock the essential talent [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_innerrage.gif) Defiance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12792/defiance), as well as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_ashestoashes.gif) Last Stand](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12975/last-stand).

Best Professions for Warrior Tanks in Classic Fresh
---------------------------------------------------

### [Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Engineering is an absolute must-have if you are trying to go the extra mile in PvE (or PvP). The addition of explosives, such as [![Goblin Sapper Charge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Sapper Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge), [![Dense Dynamite](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_06.gif) Dense Dynamite](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18641/dense-dynamite) and [![Iron Grenade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_08.gif) Iron Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4390/iron-grenade), to your toolkit is invaluable as a [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank. They fill a gap in AoE damage and threat that will completely change the scope of your utility in raids and allow you to perform exclusive pull techniques on top of boosting your snap threat overall with the additional, instant damage of a big explosion at the start of the fight. Being an engineer also allows you to equip the very powerful [![Force Reactive Disk](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_arcane_portaldarnassus.gif) Force Reactive Disk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18168/force-reactive-disk), a shield that sparks with lightning every time you block and damages all nearby enemies, which is yet another tool to increase your AoE threat generation.   
  
As a melee class, it is recommended that you specialize in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/trade_engineering.gif) Gnomish Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20220/gnomish-engineering), allowing you to craft the [![Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_polymorphchicken.gif) Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10725/gnomish-battle-chicken), a bind on pickup trinket that summons a pet that has a chance to buff your party with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_birdbeck_01.gif) Battle Squawk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23060/battle-squawk) when in combat. This buff increases the melee attack speed of all party members by 5% for 4 minutes, and each engineer in your party can summon their own chicken for a chance at stacking 5x[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_birdbeck_01.gif) Battle Squawk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23060/battle-squawk) for up to +25% attack speed every 30 minutes. For reference, this is almost as much attack speed as Heroism/Bloodlust in TBC, except 6 times the duration!  
  
Other amazing perks of the profession include:
