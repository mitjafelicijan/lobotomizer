Viability of Mages in WoW Classic PvE Content
---------------------------------------------

Mages are incredibly viable in Classic WoW PvE. They bring tonnes of damage and utility to groups, and will always be needed in both Dungeons and Raids thanks to this. They are also effective against almost every monster in the game, as Mages utilize Frost, Fire, and Arcane damage, something which other classes can’t do.  
  
In Dungeons, Mages will always be useful, you can even take three Mages and have a very comfortable Dungeon run. Meanwhile, in raids there are around 5 spots open for Mages, sometimes there are even more depending on the group and raid. For example, in Ahn’Qiraj 40 guilds tend to go with 7 or more Mages as the class is very effective there.  
  
Frost Mages are the most viable as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_ice_magicdamage.gif) Elemental Precision](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=29440/elemental-precision) provides a large amount of hit and most early bosses are immune to Fire Damage until later phases.

---

Strengths of Classic Mages
--------------------------

#### * Incredible single target and AoE damage

Mages have the strongest AoE damage in the game. Spells like [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_icestorm.gif) Blizzard](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10187/blizzard), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_glacier.gif) Cone of Cold](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10161/cone-of-cold), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Arcane Explosion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10202/arcane-explosion) are reliable crowd control and damaging tools, making Mages vital to any PvE and PvP group. Additionally, Mages are one of the best ranged damage dealers in the game.  
  
With the switch to phase 5, Fire Mages have risen in popularity and damage, making Makes much stronger and capable of very competitive damage numbers comparable to Warriors. Frost Mages continue to do well in older content, as well as PvP and AoE farming techniques, but the gradual shift from Frost to Fire dominance will continue into Phase 6 and the rest of Classic WoW.

#### * Amazing utility and convenience

Mages bring a great deal of utility to group content, making them very desirable members of any group. Spells like [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_magicalsentry.gif) Arcane Intellect](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10157/arcane-intellect), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_polymorph.gif) Polymorph](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12826/polymorph), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_food_73cinnamonroll.gif) Conjure Food](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=28612/conjure-food) & [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_drink_18.gif) Conjure Water](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10140/conjure-water), and of course, various [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_arcane_portalstormwind.gif) Portal: Stormwind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10059/portal-stormwind) spells, make Mages incredibly useful. Mages are also very convenient to level as they don’t have to spend gold on food and drink and can travel around the world quickly, thanks to their Teleport and Portals.

#### * Fantastic PvP presence

Mages are fantastic in both solo and group PvP. A good Mage can pick apart almost any player thanks to the wide toolkit Mages possess. Mages can kite classes like Warriors and Rogues thanks to the innate slow in their frost spells, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_frostnova.gif) Frost Nova](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10230/frost-nova), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_arcane_blink.gif) Blink](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1953/blink). Meanwhile, a well-timed [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_iceshock.gif) Counterspell](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2139/counterspell) can be the end of classes that rely on casting.  
  
Mages also shine in group PvP. Most Mages gravitate toward Frost for the strong crowd control and defensive abilities, but a well protected Fire Mage can dish out enormous amounts of damage, decimating enemies with powerful AoE and focus fire.

#### * Efficient AoE farming

Mages are renowned for their farming skills. Thanks to their AoE and control spells, Mages are super-fast AoE farmers. A Mage can easily combine [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_glacier.gif) Cone of Cold](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10161/cone-of-cold), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_icestorm.gif) Blizzard](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10187/blizzard), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_frostnova.gif) Frost Nova](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10230/frost-nova) to control a large group of monsters and quickly deal with them. This makes for a unique way to level, as well as a very effective way to make gold at max level.

---

Weaknesses of Classic Mages
---------------------------

#### * Mages are Squishy

Mages are cloth wearers, meaning they have one of the lowest amounts of Armor of any class. Combined with a low health pool, this means Mages are liable to dying very quickly. If caught out of position and out of cooldowns, a Mage can be bursted down extremely fast. In order to be an effective Mage, a player must always be aware of their surroundings and choose their fights carefully.

#### * Mages are the most popular caster

Mages are the most popular caster in Classic and one of the most popular classes overall. While groups will always love to have a Mage, there will be a lot of competition for gear, and sometimes groups may already have too many Mages.

#### * Mages lack direct healing

Mages do not have an in-built way to heal themselves during combat. Mages have access to [![First Aid](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) First Aid](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=129/first-aid) just like every other class. However, this can easily be interrupted, and they do not have any other forms of healing. This means that if a Mage finds themselves in combat on low Health, their only hope is to finish the fight, or run, and regenerate Health through eating food once out of combat.

Best Races for PvE Classic Mages
--------------------------------

Four races can be Mages in Classic WoW: [![Gnome](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_gnome_male.gif) Gnome](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=7/gnome) and [![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) for the Alliance, and [![Troll](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_troll_male.gif) Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) and [![Undead](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_scourge_male.gif) Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) for the Horde.  
  

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Race** | [Druid Druid](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=11/druid) | [Hunter Hunter](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=3/hunter) | [Mage Mage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=8/mage) | [Paladin Paladin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=2/paladin) | [Priest Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) | [Rogue Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue) | [Shaman Shaman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=7/shaman) | [Warlock Warlock](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=9/warlock) | [Warrior Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) |
| [Dwarf Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Gnome Gnome](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=7/gnome) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Human Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Night Elf Night Elf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=4/night-elf) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Orc Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Tauren Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Troll Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Undead Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Best Race for Alliance Mages

A key benefit of picking Alliance for your [![Mage](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_mage.gif) Mage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=8/mage) is the access to support from a [![Paladin](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_paladin.gif) Paladin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=2/paladin). Paladins are a fantastic support class for mages, as they can provide powerful buffs such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofwisdom.gif) Blessing of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25290/blessing-of-wisdom) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofsalvation.gif) Blessing of Salvation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1038/blessing-of-salvation). Additionally, Paladins provide Auras that buff all party members, ideally [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_mindsooth.gif) Concentration Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19746/concentration-aura) will be used, which is incredibly beneficial in any fight where you take damage.  
  
There are only two race choices per faction for Mages. Although races have their benefits, it is important to note that the differences won’t massively affect your gameplay, and you should also take into account which race you would enjoy playing.  
  
[![Gnome](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_gnome_male.gif) Gnome](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=7/gnome) is the best Classic WoW Alliance Mage race for both PvE and PvP.

#### [Human Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) Mage

Humans have minimal benefits for Mages. The essential advantage of playing as a Human is the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_note_02.gif) Diplomacy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20599/diplomacy) racial, which reduces the amount of time investment required for raising reputations. The [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_shardbrilliantsmall.gif) The Human Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20598/the-human-spirit) will slightly boost Mana Regeneration but is not massively helpful, while [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20600/perception) is only useful when looking for Stealthed Rogues and Prowling Druids in PVP.  
  
As a Mage, you will never need to make use of your melee weapon, so the weapon specialization racials are useless.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_note_02.gif) Diplomacy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20599/diplomacy): Reputation gains increased by 10%.

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20600/perception): Dramatically increases stealth detection for 20 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_meleedamage.gif) Sword Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20597/sword-specialization): Skill with Swords and Two-Handed Swords increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_shardbrilliantsmall.gif) The Human Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20598/the-human-spirit): Spirit increased by 5%.

#### [Gnome Gnome](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=7/gnome) Mage

Gnomes are the better of the two races for both PvE and PvP. The [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_essenceeternallarge.gif) Expansive Mind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20591/expansive-mind) racial will provide a boost to your total Mana and damage. Meanwhile, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_trip.gif) Escape Artist](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20589/escape-artist) is an amazing tool to have access to in PvP, allowing you to escape from immobilizing effects such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_stranglevines.gif) Entangling Roots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9853/entangling-roots) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_shockwave.gif) Improved Hamstring](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23695/improved-hamstring). The [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gear_01.gif) Engineering Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20593/engineering-specialization) racial is also handy to have, as Engineering is a crucial profession for Mages.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Arcane Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20592/arcane-resistance): Arcane Resistance increased.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_essenceeternallarge.gif) Expansive Mind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20591/expansive-mind): Intelligence increased by 5%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gear_01.gif) Engineering Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20593/engineering-specialization): Engineering skill increased by 15.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_trip.gif) Escape Artist](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20589/escape-artist): Escape the effects of any immobilization or movement speed reduction effect.

---

### Best Race for Horde Mages

As a Horde [![Mage](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_mage.gif) Mage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=8/mage), you will have access to the support skills of a [![Shaman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_shaman.gif) Shaman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=7/shaman). Shamans are a great support class for Mages, primarily due to their arsenal of Totems. Two primary Totems benefit Mages; these are [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_brilliance.gif) Tranquil Air Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25908/tranquil-air-totem) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_manaregentotem.gif) Mana Spring Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10497/mana-spring-totem), both of these Totems allow you to focus on doing damage rather than focusing as much on Mana and Threat.  
  
[![Troll](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_troll_male.gif) Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) is the best Classic WoW Horde Mage race for PvE, and [![Undead](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_scourge_male.gif) Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) is the best Classic WoW Horde Mage race for PvP.

#### [Troll Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) Mage

The key benefit of picking a Troll is the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_troll_berserk.gif) Berserking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=26296/berserking) racial. This passive provides a substantial damage boost, especially when low on health. This doesn’t happen very often, however, as you are liable to die quickly if left on low health, especially in raids.  
  
The other passives are relatively insignificant. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_regenerate.gif) Regeneration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20555/regeneration) slightly reduces the amount of healing you will need, while [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pelt_bear_ruin_02.gif) Beast Slaying](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20557/beast-slaying) can be helpful while leveling, but come late game, there are very few beasts to fight.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pelt_bear_ruin_02.gif) Beast Slaying](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20557/beast-slaying): Damage dealt versus Beasts increased by 5%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_troll_berserk.gif) Berserking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20554/berserking): Increases your casting and attack speed by 10% to 30%. At full health the speed increase is 10% with a greater effect up to 30% if you are badly hurt when you activate Berserking. Lasts 10 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_bow_12.gif) Bow Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=26290/bow-specialization): Skill with Bow Weapons increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_regenerate.gif) Regeneration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20555/regeneration): Health regeneration rate increased by 10%. 10% of total Health regeneration may continue during combat.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_throwingaxe_03.gif) Throwing Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20558/throwing-specialization): Skill with Throwing Weapons increased by 5.

#### [Undead Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) Mage

Undead mainly benefit Mages in PvP. The [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_raisedead.gif) Will of the Forsaken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=7744/will-of-the-forsaken) racial is fantastic as it allows you to remove specific negative effects, which can be handy in certain PvE encounters, and only has a two-minute cooldown compared to [![Insignia of the Horde](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_trinketpvp_02.gif) Insignia of the Horde](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18849/insignia-of-the-horde) five-minute cooldown. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_demonbreath.gif) Underwater Breathing](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=5227/underwater-breathing) is useful when doing quests that require you to go underwater, but that’s about it.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_cannibalize.gif) Cannibalize](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20577/cannibalize): When activated, regenerates 7% of total health every 2 sec for 10 sec. Only works on Humanoid or Undead corpses within 5 yds. Any movement, action, or damage taken while Cannibalizing will cancel the effect.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_detectinvisibility.gif) Shadow Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20579/shadow-resistance): Shadow Resistance increased by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_demonbreath.gif) Underwater Breathing](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=5227/underwater-breathing): Underwater breath lasts 300% longer than normal.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_raisedead.gif) Will of the Forsaken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=7744/will-of-the-forsaken): Provides immunity to Charm, Fear and Sleep while active. May also be used while already afflicted by Charm, Fear or Sleep. Lasts 5 sec.

WoW Classic Mage DPS Specializations
------------------------------------

There are three specialization talent trees for Classic Mages: Arcane, Fire, and Frost. All three Mage talent trees provide DPS benefits and are strong in their own right, with several viable talent combinations, depending on whether the player is interested in Dungeons, Raiding, or PvP.   
  
 **Arcane:** Manipulate the arcane, destroying enemies with overwhelming power.

* [Arcane Power builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/mage/dps-talent-builds-pve#arcane-power-frost) are typically the go to dungeon and raid spec until Ahn'Qiraj, which focuses on Mana, spell damage, reducing resistances, and the powerful cooldown [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_lightning.gif) Arcane Power](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12042/arcane-power).

 **Fire:** Ignite enemies with balls of fire and combustive flames.

* [Combustion builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/mage/dps-talent-builds-pve#combustion-fire) start off slow, as Fire spells are usually more mana intensive than frost, but benefits greatly from better gear and increased Critical Strike chance through [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_incinerate.gif) Ignite](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12848/ignite) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_sealoffire.gif) Combustion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11129/combustion). Many early raid bosses are immune to fire damage, but the specialization leaps ahead in Ahn'Qiraj and Naxxramas.

 **Frost:** Freezes enemies in their tracks and shatters them with Frost magic.

* [Ice Barrier Builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/mage/dps-talent-builds-pve#deep-frost-pvp) require deep investment into Frost, which can be both useful for increasing the output of other Mages in raid, but is also extremely capable in PvP, granting large amounts of survivability with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_frost.gif) Ice Block](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11958/ice-block) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_ice_lament.gif) Ice Barrier](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=13033/ice-barrier).

### Best Mage Spec for PvE in WoW Classic

Fire Mages pull ahead as the best spec in WoW Classic Phase 5, as Ahn'Qiraj bosses are not immune to Fire Damage the way Molten Core and Blackwing Lair ones were. Itemization also catches up to support Fire's critical strike focus, without sacrificing hit or spell power.  
  
Many Mages will continue to play Frost in PvP and other forms of content, but the majority of raiders will transition to Fire and stay that way throughout the rest of Phase 5 and into Phase 6.  
  
All viable end-game PvE builds are covered in our [Classic Mage DPS Talents & Builds Guide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/mage/dps-talent-builds-pve).

Best Professions for Classic Mages
----------------------------------

### [Tailoring](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/tailoring-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Tailoring is virtually a necessity for maximizing early Mage damage, as many crafted items last well into Phase 5. [![Robe of the Archmage](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_cloth_38.gif) Robe of the Archmage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14152/robe-of-the-archmage) is one of these items; it is available from the get-go and is the best chest for Mages until the [Bloodvine Garb](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=421/bloodvine-garb) set from Zul’Gurub. The set remains as the best set of items until the next stage, Ahn’Qiraj, so in order to maximize damage throughout most of the game Tailoring is vital.  
  
In later phases, the focus on tailoring diminishes, but it remains a lucrative profession due to a Mages farming abilities. Mages are by far the best class at killing large amounts of monsters quickly, meaning they are able to farm large amounts of cloth very quickly, making the profession fast and cheap to level.

### [Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Engineering is another profession that is vital for Mages trying to maximize damage. The profession is advantageous in both PvE and PvP due to its various bombs and gadgets.  
  
As a mage you will want to pick up [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Engineer](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20222/goblin-engineer), this will let you make your own [![Goblin Sapper Charge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Sapper Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge), which provide a large damage boost through their AoE and are key in certain fights like [Viscidus](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15299/viscidus). Engineering also provides you with items like [![Dense Dynamite](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_06.gif) Dense Dynamite](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18641/dense-dynamite) and [![Iron Grenade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_08.gif) Iron Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4390/iron-grenade). Both of these provide around 400 damage on a short cooldown and will provide you with a substantial DPS boost.  
  
Iron Grenades are also handy for PvP as they provide a short stun that can get you out of trouble. Items like [![Gnomish Rocket Boots](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_02.gif) Gnomish Rocket Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10724/gnomish-rocket-boots), [![Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_04.gif) Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18638/hyper-radiant-flame-reflector), and [![Arcane Bomb](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_mindbomb.gif) Arcane Bomb](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16040/arcane-bomb) are also powerful in PvP as they provide a lot of interesting benefits that can turn the tide in a fight. The Trinkets are able to reflect key spells like [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_fireball02.gif) Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18809/pyroblast), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_frostbolt02.gif) Frostbolt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25304/frostbolt), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_deathcoil.gif) Death Coil](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17926/death-coil), while Rocket Boots can let you escape from a sticky situation.

Mage Class Mechanics
--------------------

### Mana

Mages make use of Mana to power their spells. The amount of Mana available to a Mage depends on their level and their Intellect, the higher the level and Intellect, the higher the total Mana pool.  
  
Mana regenerates over time, both in and out of combat. However, regeneration can be interrupted through spell casting. At the start of a spell cast, Mana regeneration is suspended for five seconds, this is known as the “five-second rule”. Sometimes, players will choose to avoid casting spells to regenerate Mana at a faster rate, especially while leveling. Note: spells that do not cost mana do not interrupt mana regeneration.  
  
Mana regeneration can be increased with Spells, Spirit or items that give additional Mana regeneration, known as Mana per 5. Additionally, potions and various other items can be used to restore a set amount of mana instantly.
