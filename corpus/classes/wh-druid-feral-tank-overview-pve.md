Viability of Feral Druid Tank in Classic Fresh PvE Content
----------------------------------------------------------

Bears are strong tanks throughout the entirety of vanilla WoW, capable of both main tanking and off-tanking all of the raid content in the game at a high level. They have the highest effective health pool (EHP) of all vanilla tanking specs due to amplified Armor values on a lot of Feral gear and the amazing Armor scaling from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_bearform.gif) Dire Bear Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9634/dire-bear-form), allowing bears to soak large damage spikes from bosses with ease. In contrast, bears pack a lot less avoidance than [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tanks in vanilla, as they lack the ability to parry and also lack well balanced gear options that pack strong avoidance stats without compromising their EHP or Threat generation. This trend is completely reversed in TBC, where the Agility-to-Dodge conversion for bears is buffed significantly in conjunction with an abundance of Agility on leather tanking gear, making Ferals the premiere avoidance tanks in that expansion.   
  
Compared to dual wielding Fury-Prot [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tanks, bears put out very comparable single target Threat Per Second (TPS) across all vanilla content phases, but take *substantially* less damage while doing so. This is because the available Threat gear swaps for Warriors are quite "inefficient" in terms of mitigation lost per TPS gained: see for example the massive mitigation difference between the Phase 1 balanced chest piece [![Knight-Captain's Plate Hauberk](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_plate16.gif) Knight-Captain's Plate Hauberk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23300/knight-captains-plate-hauberk) versus its Threat alternative [![Savage Gladiator Chain](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_chain_15.gif) Savage Gladiator Chain](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11726/savage-gladiator-chain). In contrast, Druids possess the most efficient mitigation-to-Threat swap in the game in the form of the easily farmable consumable [![Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_14.gif) Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler). MCP allows a Feral tank to secure over *40%* of their total TPS output in a *single gear slot*, thereby freeing up the entire remainder of the gear set for stacking as much mitigation as desired while still holding Threat comfortably.  
  
Unfortunately, while bears take far less damage than Fury-Prot [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tanks when wearing Threat gear, they also *deal* far less damage when tanking. The personal DPS of a Feral tank is less than half of what a good Fury-Prot Warrior can put out. This is the case because bears rely on the heavily inflated 2.5375*x* Threat modifier of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_maul.gif) Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9881/maul) for holding aggro, and as a result, the raw damage output of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_maul.gif) Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9881/maul) is tuned quite low to keep bear TPS reasonable. For this reason, Feral tanks are never utilized in vanilla speedrunning guilds, where the tank's personal DPS is more impactful to the overall raid clear time than the amount of damage they take. Compared to TBC, Ferals in vanilla fill the *exact same niche* of high single target TPS, low damage taken per second (DTPS), and mediocre personal DPS compared to Fury tanks - the only difference is that tank damage in TBC is tuned such that low DTPS actually matters, whereas it is not relevant at the top end of vanilla speedrunning since most vanilla raid bosses do not hit hard at all relative to the available healing in a typical raid comp.  
  
Compared to a Deep Prot [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank, or to a Fury-Prot tank wearing heavy mitigation gear and a shield, a Feral Druid still possesses much higher EHP, but will take a lot more damage on average due to their low attainable avoidance and susceptibility to crushing blows. This makes Warriors the better tank choice for the small handful of vanilla bosses where tank healing is actually a limiting factor, most notably the [Loatheb](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=16011/loatheb) and [Sapphiron](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15989/sapphiron) encounters in [Naxxramas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3456/naxxramas), and the [Atiesh](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=16387/atiesh) encounter at the end of the quest chain for assembling [![Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_staff_medivh.gif) Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22632/atiesh-greatstaff-of-the-guardian). For the vast majority of vanilla raid content, however, any casual raid that is considering using a Deep Prot [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank for safety reasons would be better served with a Feral instead, as the bear will put out higher personal DPS and *much* higher TPS while still being extremely easy to heal.  
  
In summary, if you are interested in tanking for a top speedrunning guild in Classic Fresh, then playing a Druid is not a great choice, as a Fury-Prot tank is the better choice when optimizing for raw damage output. For all other raid environments, however, Ferals are an excellent choice for both main tank and off-tank roles. A bear will especially shine in a "semi-hardcore" raid environment where your DPS will require a very high Threat ceiling when trying to parse, but where tank deaths can still be a concern due to imperfect healers. **Note that the above assessment applies *only* for Ferals who put in the required effort to farm Pummelers between raid lockouts: a bear tank without MCP is a far, far cry from a Warrior tank in performance, and should *never* be main tanking raid bosses.**

### Strengths of Classic Feral Druid Tanks

##### Excellent gear scaling

Similar to Fury-Prot [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tanks, and *unlike* Deep Prot [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tanks, bear Threat generation scales exceedingly well with the primary and secondary stats found on melee DPS gear: Strength, Agility, Attack Power, Hit, Crit, and Haste. This is because a bear's TPS is tied 1:1 with their *DPS*, since [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_maul.gif) Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9881/maul) is the only significant Threat generator for Ferals, and the Threat it generates is directly proportional to the damage done, without any static Threat components such as those on the Warrior [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_ambush.gif) Heroic Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11567/heroic-strike) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_sunder.gif) Sunder Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11597/sunder-armor) abilities. As a result, Ferals can easily exceed the TPS that is needed to hold aggro off even the most competitive DPS players by wearing standard leather DPS gear pieces from dungeons, raids, and PvP, in conjunction with [![Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_14.gif) Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler). MCP acts as a force multiplier on all of your other gear, as it effectively inflates the TPS added by each gear piece by a whopping *50%*, making your armor upgrades substantially more impactful than they would be otherwise.  
  
On the defensive axis, bears also scale extremely well from Stamina and Armor on gear pieces, due to the 1.2 *x* bonus multiplier on Stamina from the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofagility.gif) Heart of the Wild](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24894/heart-of-the-wild) talent and the 4.6 *x* bonus multiplier on Armor from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_bearform.gif) Dire Bear Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9634/dire-bear-form) (which can be further increased to 4.784 *x* when talented into 2/5 [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pelt_bear_03.gif) Thick Hide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16930/thick-hide) as part of the standard [main tank spec](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/feral/tank-talent-builds-pve#14-32-5-main-tank-build)). In particular, this makes all gear pieces with elevated Armor allocation (such as [![Malfurion's Blessed Bulwark](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_leather_08.gif) Malfurion's Blessed Bulwark](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19405/malfurions-blessed-bulwark) and [![Boots of the Shadow Flame](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_cloth_05.gif) Boots of the Shadow Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19381/boots-of-the-shadow-flame) from [Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair)) disproportionately useful for Feral tanks compared to other specs, as the bonus Armor budget is worth over 4.6 times as much as the tooltip value when in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_bearform.gif) Dire Bear Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9634/dire-bear-form)!

##### Hybrid gearing and role

Strictly speaking, Feral Druids are the only *truly* hybrid spec in Classic WoW, as they can perform two distinct roles (tanking and DPS) near-optimally with the exact same talents without making significant compromises to either role. No other class in Classic can do this, as talent trees for distinct roles are typically specialized enough that it is impossible to perform both roles optimally. In contrast, the Feral talent tree in vanilla is quite tightly optimized, with most of the beneficial cat and bear PvE talents consolidated together such that players do not need to focus on just one or the other at level 60. This means that the exact same talent build can be used for main tanking, off-tanking, and cat DPS, providing Feral Druids with the flexibility to fill in any of these roles as needed for a given raid team. Trash packs in vanilla raids typically require more tanks than boss encounters, so there are numerous single tank boss fights where off-tanks should DPS instead. Ferals excel in this role since cat DPS, although not competitive with top DPS classes like Fury Warriors and Rogues, is still very respectable and surpasses a number of other utility specs.  
  
Playing a hybrid role in raids is especially efficient for Ferals because a lot of the best tanking leather is also best in slot or close for DPS. For example, the Phase 1 BiS gear sets for [bear tanking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/feral/tank-bis-gear-pve-phase-4) and [cat DPS](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/wow-classic-feral-druid-dps-blackwing-lair-zg-best-in-slot-gear) in Classic Fresh are pretty much *exactly the same*, differing materially in only the helm, cloak, and trinket slots. As such, a Feral off-tank simply needs to substitute [![Wolfshead Helm](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_04.gif) Wolfshead Helm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8345/wolfshead-helm) into their pure tank set in order to create a hybrid gear set with almost peak performance for both tanking and DPS simultaneously! This is especially useful on boss fights where the Druid is tanking only some of the time, such as when assigned to tank [Flamewaker Protector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12119/flamewaker-protector) and [Flamewaker Elite](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11664/flamewaker-elite) adds in the [Lucifron](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12118/lucifron) and [Gehennas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12259/gehennas) encounters, respectively, within [Molten Core](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2717/molten-core). In these situations, a Feral wearing tank gear + [![Wolfshead Helm](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_04.gif) Wolfshead Helm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8345/wolfshead-helm) can seamlessly shift from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_bearform.gif) Dire Bear Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9634/dire-bear-form) into [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form) once their add is dead in order to pump quite respectable DPS into the boss for the remainder of the fight.

##### Solo farmable BiS weapon

Loot scarcity is a major issue in vanilla raiding due to the 40-man raid size, a lack of class and spec diversity in raid compositions, and low drop rates on the best loot. This is especially the case for weapon drops, which provide disproportionately large upgrades compared to other gear slots for most classes, *especially* for melee DPS classes that scale off the raw damage stats on their weapons rather than just the secondary affixes. Each Feral in your raid team effectively frees up two melee weapon drops that would otherwise need to be distributed to a Fury-Prot [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank for boosting their TPS. Of course, the fact that each Pummeler comes with only 3 charges that must be continually replenished on a weekly basis is quite annoying for the Feral themselves, but from a raid loot distribution point of view, this should be viewed as a *feature* of the spec, not a bug.

### Weaknesses of Classic Feral Druid Tanks

##### Pull variance

The single biggest downside of Feral Threat generation mechanics in vanilla WoW is the reliance on a single ability, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_maul.gif) Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9881/maul), for almost the entirety of a bear's TPS output. If your first [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_maul.gif) Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9881/maul) on a non-tauntable mob does not land successfully, then you have zero additional abilities at your disposal to establish a significant Threat lead until your swing timer ends. This forces your DPS to either wait for your next auto-attack to land before initiating combat, or (as is often the case with Classic WoW DPS players) attack anyway and die. This issue, sometimes referred to as "pull variance", is less of a problem for Fury-Prot [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tanks: even if a Warrior's first [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_ambush.gif) Heroic Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11567/heroic-strike) is avoided, they are simultaneously casting [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_bloodlust.gif) Bloodthirst](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23894/bloodthirst) as a separate source of "snap Threat" on pull, and the likelihood of *both* abilities failing to land is much smaller than either one individually. While a bear can similarly pair their initial [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_maul.gif) Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9881/maul) with a [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_monsterclaw_03.gif) Swipe](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9908/swipe) cast, the effect is hardly comparable since [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_monsterclaw_03.gif) Swipe](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9908/swipe) generates a miniscule amount of Threat, not nearly enough to rescue a failed pull.  
  
Some outdated Feral tanking guides strongly recommend gearing for the 9% melee Hit cap in order to solve this issue, but contrary to popular belief, getting Hit capped does *not* solve the pull variance problem for *any* tank in Classic WoW. Even when gearing for 9% Hit, every tank still has a 20.5% chance for their first attack to be dodged or parried by a raid boss. This means that whether or not you are Hit capped, your raid team absolutely has to be able to play around bad luck on pull. Consequently, while Hit Chance is still the strongest Threat stat for Feral tanks, there is zero requirement for it to be capped, as sacrificing an irrationally large amount of other stats on your gear set just to reach the Hit cap will *not* guarantee you any pull consistency, and does not address the root cause of your DPS not paying attention to initial dodges or parries before going all-out. If you are concerned about losing Threat on pull, a far more impactful solution is following up your initial [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_maul.gif) Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9881/maul) with a powershifted [![Goblin Sapper Charge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Sapper Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge) as a parallel source of snap Threat on your target. Note that pull variance reduction is another reason why using [![Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_14.gif) Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler) right on pull is absolutely essential even if you don't need it to keep aggro long term (for example when tanking for an Alliance raid with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofsalvation.gif) Blessing of Salvation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1038/blessing-of-salvation)): there is a night and day difference between waiting out the full 2.5 second bear swing timer for your next [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_maul.gif) Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9881/maul) after an initial miss, versus only 1.57 seconds with MCP plus the full suite of available Haste enchants.

##### Limited PvE itemization

The unfortunate irony behind the amazing gear scaling of Feral tanks in vanilla is the fact that there is hardly any PvE gear available for bears to scale *with*! Just like every other hybrid spec in vanilla, Ferals lack any dedicated Tier sets and must instead rely on a small handful of off-piece upgrades from each raid for their PvE gear progression. Compounding this problem is the fact that early Blizzard developers did not at all understand how to properly itemize off-piece leather for Ferals, so many of the options that *do* exist spend their stat allocation very inefficiently. For example, [![Taut Dragonhide Belt](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_16.gif) Taut Dragonhide Belt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19396/taut-dragonhide-belt) from [Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair) is clearly intended to be a leather tanking piece, but Blizzard "priced" avoidance stats like Defense and Dodge far too expensively on vanilla gear, leading to insufficient stat allocation on this belt towards other more useful stats like Hit or Crit. Therefore, despite being a raid reward, [![Taut Dragonhide Belt](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_16.gif) Taut Dragonhide Belt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19396/taut-dragonhide-belt) ends up quickly replaced by the Rare quality [![Belt of Preserved Heads](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_14.gif) Belt of Preserved Heads](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20216/belt-of-preserved-heads) from [Zul'Gurub](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=1977/zulgurub) just one phase later. As a result, until the release of AQ40 in Phase 5, PvP rewards are the only source of high quality tanking gear for Ferals during the first half of Classic Fresh. If you do not intend to grind out any PvP ranking or reputation rewards, then you will be stuck wearing pre-raid gear like the [Devilsaur Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=143/devilsaur-armor) set and [![Mask of the Unforgiven](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bandana_01.gif) Mask of the Unforgiven](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13404/mask-of-the-unforgiven) all the way until Phase 4! The silver lining here is that bear TPS with [![Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_14.gif) Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler) is so insanely high that you can still tank competitively throughout this period while wearing dungeon blues, even after your DPS start acquiring raid quality upgrades.

##### Lack of defensive cooldowns

During the early stages of progression in a raid tier, especially when tanks are relatively under-geared, strong defensive cooldowns such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_ashestoashes.gif) Last Stand](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12975/last-stand) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_shieldwall.gif) Shield Wall](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=871/shield-wall) are very helpful for easing the tank healing burden while the raid learns boss mechanics and healing assignments are being optimized. Even when bosses are on farm, these abilities can function as "bad luck protection" to prevent tank deaths in cases with unlucky damage streams such as repeated boss parries. Druid tanks unfortunately lack any such tools and their survivability is entirely passive, relying on high EHP levels to provide a buffer against damage spikes. Technically, druids have two defensive cooldowns in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_stoneclawtotem.gif) Barkskin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22812/barkskin) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_bullrush.gif) Frenzied Regeneration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22896/frenzied-regeneration). However, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_stoneclawtotem.gif) Barkskin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22812/barkskin) can only be cast in caster form and incurs a GCD, so it is effectively useless as a reactive tool when tanking in raids. In vanilla, it is not even worth casting [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_stoneclawtotem.gif) Barkskin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22812/barkskin) at the *start* of a pull to reduce initial tank damage, due to the significant attack speed debuff that is incurred when it is active. In the case of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_bullrush.gif) Frenzied Regeneration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22896/frenzied-regeneration), the ability was massively undertuned, and the health regeneration it supplies is negligible relative to incoming damage and tank health pools in Classic. Moreover, healing over time (HoT) spells only provide value when cast preemptively before *smooth* damage streams where individual HoT ticks provide full value, whereas most emergency scenarios for tanks involve large damage spikes in a short period of time that require *burst* healing.

Class Mechanics for Feral Druid Tank in Classic Fresh
-----------------------------------------------------

##### EHP

Effective health pool, or EHP, is one of the primary metrics by which to measure the "tankiness" of a character. EHP tracks the *worst case survivability* of a tank, and is most relevant when tanking hard hitting bosses with slow swing timers. Specifically, a tank's EHP divided by the largest hit they might receive from a boss tells us the maximum number of worst case hits that can be soaked without heals before the tank dies. For example, let's suppose a bear with 26,000 EHP is tanking [Broodlord Lashlayer](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12017/broodlord-lashlayer), whose melee swing hits for a maximum of around 3,250 unmitigated damage with typical debuffs in play. Since crit immunity is not attainable for tanks in vanilla WoW when wearing reasonable gear, the worst case possible damage stream from the boss is therefore repeated critical strikes, each hitting for 6,500 unmitigated damage. The EHP number thus tells us that the bear can survive a maximum of 4 sequential crits before dying (a figure that wildly surpasses that of a Warrior tank). EHP is an important metric to optimize as a tank because it provides buffer room against bad luck, giving healers time to react and keep the tank alive.  
  
EHP is calculated as: *H / (1 - r)*, where *H* is the total raid buffed HP of the tank, and *r* is their fractional damage mitigation from Armor. For example, an Armor capped bear (17,265 raid buffed Armor) has the maximum damage mitigation of 75%, or *r = 0.75* . The relationship between damage mitigation and Armor is *r = A / (A + 5755)*, where *A* is the fully raid buffed Armor value in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_bearform.gif) Dire Bear Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9634/dire-bear-form). In these formulas, we see that the only stats that can increase the worst case EHP of a tank are Stamina and Armor (from both gear and Agility), which makes sense because avoidance stats are irrelevant when considering the worst case outcome where none of the hits are avoided. Due to the inflated Armor values on the PvP ranking and reputation gear sets for Ferals, bears will have the highest EHP of all tank specs as early as Phase 1, but the Armor soft cap of 11,513 (after factoring in [![Elixir of Superior Defense](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_66.gif) Elixir of Superior Defense](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13445/elixir-of-superior-defense), [![Greater Stoneshield Potion](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_69.gif) Greater Stoneshield Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13455/greater-stoneshield-potion), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_regeneration.gif) Mark of the Wild](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9885/mark-of-the-wild), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shield_06.gif) Inspiration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15359/inspiration)) limits the rate at which EHP can scale in later phases.

##### Avoidance

In addition to Armor, which reduces the damage dealt by each boss swing, the other key way to reduce a tank's DTPS is by reducing the fraction of swings that land successfully. In Classic WoW, there are three ways for an attempted melee attack to be unsuccessful: the attacker can miss the target entirely, the target can dodge the blow, or the target can parry the attack. A tank's *total avoidance* is defined as the sum of these Miss, Dodge, and Parry stats when raid buffed. Bear tanks cannot parry unlike Warriors and Paladins, so only Miss and Dodge apply when optimizing avoidance.  
  
A level 63 raid boss has a base 4.4% change to miss a level 60 player with 300 Defense skill. The only way to increase this further from gear is via additional Defense; each point of Defense skill increases the boss miss chance by 0.04%. In contrast, a player's chance to dodge can be enhanced by three stats: Defense, Agility, and direct Dodge Chance affixes on gear. Each point of Defense skill provides 0.04% Dodge (in addition to its effect on Miss), each point in Agility provides 0.05% Dodge, and gear pieces can additionally provide Dodge directly in 1% or 2% increments.  
  
When gearing as a Feral tank in vanilla, it is recommended to put very little value on avoidance relative to EHP. This is because avoidance does not synergize well with how damage intake and healing for tanks function in vanilla raids. Incoming damage from raid bosses is extremely spikey in vanilla, and it is simply impossible to stack enough EHP to survive more than a few consecutive damage spikes from hard-hitting bosses even when gearing for mitigation. On top of this, itemization for bears is limited to avoidance levels that peak at only 25% or so in endgame BiS gear. This means that as a tank, you can never rely on dodges to keep you alive when you don't have enough Stamina or Armor to do so. As a result, spam healing tanks and accepting a large amount of overhealing as a consequence is standard practice amongst competitive healing teams in vanilla. Getting in a lucky dodge once in a while does not help these healing teams out whatsoever, as they need to be spam healing you regardless to avoid a death from a bad RNG spike, so the dodge just turns into more overhealing.  
  
This paradigm gets turned on its head in late TBC, when Druids can stack so much Dodge that tanks are avoiding a large majority of damage intake, making dodges a quite reliable source of mitigation in that expansion and onwards. Tank EHP levels in TBC are also enormous compared to vanilla, meaning that tanks no longer need to be spam healed continuously to stay alive, and healers can therefore react intelligently to dodges in order to save Mana.

##### Threat

In addition to gearing for survivability and reducing damage taken in an encounter, the second key responsibility of a tank is to keep the mob's attention (or aggro) away from DPS and healers. World of Warcraft uses a Threat value for each player on a given mob to determine which player has aggro and takes hits from the mob. Maintaining higher Threat than all of the DPS in the raid is just as important as survivability, especially in the Classic WoW meta where DPS has been tightly optimized compared to retail vanilla, and the output of Fury Warriors in particular can be easily capped by the tank's Threat ceiling.  
  
Bear tanks generate Threat exclusively by dealing damage, since the Threat value of the key bear abilities [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_maul.gif) Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9881/maul) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_monsterclaw_03.gif) Swipe](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9908/swipe) is tied directly to their damage. This means that a balanced tanking set needs to value DPS stats (such as Attack Power, Crit, Hit, and Haste) on an equal playing field to defensive stats such as Stamina and Armor. The balance between DPS stats and tank stats in a gear set is very situational and depends on the damage profile of the encounter as well as the Threat ceiling needed for a particular raid team to perform.

##### Rage

Rage is the primary in-combat resource used by bear tanks to generate Threat. Unlike Mana, which starts high and is depleted slowly over the course of an encounter, or Energy, which regenerates rapidly on a fixed server tick and is spent immediately, Rage is *actively* generated by the player by dealing or taking damage. Therefore, Rage generation is directly tied to both the offensive and defensive stats on the tank's gear. At level 60, bears generate 10 Rage for every 922 damage *taken from* a mob, and generate 10 Rage for every 307 damage *dealt to* a mob from auto-attacks (white damage). Note that you should *never* be auto-attacking a mob for Rage unless absolutely necessary, as your number 1 goal in the bear TPS rotation is being able to queue a [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_maul.gif) Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9881/maul) on every single one of your melee swings. As a result, incoming damage from getting hit is in practice the sole source of Rage generation for a Feral tank in vanilla. Because of this, mitigation stats such as Armor and Dodge actually have a negative impact on bear TPS, as they reduce the Rage that is available for casting [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_maul.gif) Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9881/maul) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_monsterclaw_03.gif) Swipe](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9908/swipe). Because of this, it is detrimental to wear too much mitigation for an encounter beyond what is needed to comfortably survive.

Specializations for Feral Druid Tank in Classic Fresh
-----------------------------------------------------

Feral Druids specialize deep into the Feral tree, with only a limited number of talent points spent elsewhere. This section will describe the overall benefits of each tree in the context of tanking.

##### Balance

The Balance tree contains a number of valuable talents for Feral tanks. Most importantly, the straight 10% total damage boost from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_staff_01.gif) Natural Weapons](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16906/natural-weapons) is mandatory and worth many other talents combined. In addition, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_crystalball.gif) Omen of Clarity](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16864/omen-of-clarity) is also a great tanking talent, as free Maul casts from Omen procs translate directly into more GCDs that can be filled with Swipe for bonus Threat. Finally, taking [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Natural Shapeshifter](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16835/natural-shapeshifter) is a requirement for *all* Ferals, as even main tanks should be spending a decent chunk of time throughout a raid DPSing in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form) when their tank target is dead, and the talent is necessary to powershift sustainably without running out of Mana prematurely.

##### Feral

The overwhelming majority of useful talents for Feral druid tanking and DPS are found in the Feral tree. The vanilla Feral tree is tightly optimized with lots of overlapping cat and bear talents, so the exact same build can be used for both roles without making significant compromises to either one. For tanking specifically, the most important mandatory talents are [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_hunter_pet_hyena.gif) Ferocity](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16938/ferocity), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Feral Instinct](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16951/feral-instinct), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_hunter_pet_bear.gif) Feral Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16979/feral-charge), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_monsterclaw_04.gif) Sharpened Claws](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16944/sharpened-claws), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_hunter_pet_cat.gif) Predatory Strikes](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16975/predatory-strikes), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_ravage.gif) Savage Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16999/savage-fury), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofagility.gif) Heart of the Wild](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24894/heart-of-the-wild), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Leader of the Pack](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17007/leader-of-the-pack). The presence of so many highly impactful talents deep into the Feral tree constrains any Feral talent build to invest heavily in this tree rather than hybridizing. Lower impact tanking talents are [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pelt_bear_03.gif) Thick Hide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16930/thick-hide) (since Feral gear approaches the Armor soft cap even without this talent) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_cannibalize.gif) Primal Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16961/primal-fury). Technically, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_faeriefire.gif) Faerie Fire (Feral)](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16857/faerie-fire-feral) can be omitted if a Balance or Restoration druid is consistently present in the raid group, but it is recommended not to skip it.

##### Restoration

An optimized Feral talent build will take only 5 points in the Restoration tree for maxing out the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofstamina.gif) Furor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17061/furor) talent. The primary purpose of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofstamina.gif) Furor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17061/furor) is to unlock the Feral DPS powershifting rotation in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form), so it is mandatory for *all* Ferals to talent it in order to be able to DPS effectively when not actively tanking a mob. The Restoration tree also contains the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_enrage.gif) Improved Enrage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17082/improved-enrage) talent that is a nice quality of life boost for bear tanks, but it unfortunately cannot be taken in any competitively viable talent build due to a lack of available talent points after accounting for other mandatory tanking and DPS talents.

### Best PvE Spec for Feral Druid Tank in Classic Fresh

The best PvE talent build for Feral Druids is **14/32/5**, and is optimized for both tanking and DPS simultaneously without compromising significantly on either front. There are a few variants of the build that are covered in our [Classic Feral Druid Tank Talents & Builds Guide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/feral/tank-talent-builds-pve), but these differ only in the choice of whether to talent [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_cannibalize.gif) Primal Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16961/primal-fury) vs. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ghoulfrenzy.gif) Blood Frenzy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16954/blood-frenzy), and whether to talent [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pelt_bear_03.gif) Thick Hide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16930/thick-hide) vs. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_ability_druid_demoralizingroar.gif) Feral Aggression](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16859/feral-aggression). Besides these limited variations, the build takes every single Feral talent besides [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritwolf.gif) Feline Swiftness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24866/feline-swiftness) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_bash.gif) Brutal Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16941/brutal-impact), both of which are PvP / open world talents that do not benefit your PvE performance in raids. Every other talent in the Feral tree provides either DPS or tanking value and should be taken for PvE, since one of the primary benefits of Feral Druids in Classic raids is the ability to perform either role equally well. The most important talents for tanking specifically are listed in the "Feral" section above.  
  
Outside of the Feral tree, this build takes [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofstamina.gif) Furor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17061/furor), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_staff_01.gif) Natural Weapons](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16906/natural-weapons), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Natural Shapeshifter](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16835/natural-shapeshifter), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_crystalball.gif) Omen of Clarity](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16864/omen-of-clarity). These talents encompass everything in the Restoration and Balance trees that is essential for Feral tanking and DPS, and require "wasting" only 5 talent points on [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_abolishmagic.gif) Improved Wrath](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16818/improved-wrath) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_natureswrath.gif) Improved Nature's Grasp](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17249/improved-natures-grasp) for progressing through the Balance tree. As such, besides these 5 filler points, this build lacks a single talent that doesn't directly benefit the PvE performance of a Feral Druid, which is a testament to how tightly optimized the Feral talent tree is in Classic WoW. Additionally, most of the key bear talents are also key cat talents: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_monsterclaw_04.gif) Sharpened Claws](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16944/sharpened-claws), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_hunter_pet_cat.gif) Predatory Strikes](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16975/predatory-strikes), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_faeriefire.gif) Faerie Fire (Feral)](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16857/faerie-fire-feral), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofagility.gif) Heart of the Wild](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24894/heart-of-the-wild), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Leader of the Pack](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17007/leader-of-the-pack), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_staff_01.gif) Natural Weapons](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16906/natural-weapons), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_crystalball.gif) Omen of Clarity](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16864/omen-of-clarity).

Best Professions for Classic Feral Druid Tanks
----------------------------------------------

### [Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Engineering is an absolute must-have if you are trying to go the extra mile in PvE or PvP. In PvE, the second highest impact consumable available to Feral tanks (after [![Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_14.gif) Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler) of course) is [![Goblin Sapper Charge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Sapper Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge), which requires Goblin Engineering to craft but can be used by Engineers of either specialization. Using a Sapper at the start of every boss pull is your number 1 defense against pull variance from a missed [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_maul.gif) Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9881/maul). As mentioned earlier in this guide, pull variance is arguably the single biggest weakness of Feral tanks in a competitive raid environment due to their lack of strong instant cast spells to use as parallel sources of Threat generation to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_maul.gif) Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9881/maul). Consequently, Sappers are disproportionately useful to bears compared to Warrior tanks, as they can be freely powershifted on the very first GCD of a boss pull due to a lack of any alternative spells with competitive Threat output. On top of their pull variance value, Sappers are especially useful in a speedrun environment as a strong DPS cooldown on AoE trash packs, and partially compensate for the lack of any viable AoE damage abilities in the vanilla Feral toolkit. (Remember that [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_monsterclaw_03.gif) Swipe](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9908/swipe) does paltry amounts of damage in vanilla because it does not yet scale with Attack Power.)  
  
Engineering is also the source of the absolute best bear trinket in the entire game: [![Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_polymorphchicken.gif) Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10725/gnomish-battle-chicken), which requires the Gnomish specialization to craft. The [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_birdbeck_01.gif) Battle Squawk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23060/battle-squawk) buff provided by the [Battle Chicken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=8836/battle-chicken) scales multiplicatively with the Haste from [![Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_14.gif) Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler), and is worth close to **130 AP in value** for personal TPS. But critically, the Haste buff applies to your entire party, making the total raid DPS impact of the chicken quite enormous. Furthermore, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_birdbeck_01.gif) Battle Squawk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23060/battle-squawk) buffs from multiple chickens can be stacked and scale multiplicatively with one another, so it is optimal for every party member to use their [![Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_polymorphchicken.gif) Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10725/gnomish-battle-chicken) at the same time when progressing through raids. Recently, a [reliable method](https://tbc.wowhead.com/news/guaranteed-battle-squawk-trigger-in-burning-crusade-classic-324632) has been discovered for securing guaranteed [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_birdbeck_01.gif) Battle Squawk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23060/battle-squawk) procs, making the [![Engineering](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=202/engineering) profession even more essential for competitive raiders.

### [Enchanting](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/enchanting-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Enchanting is required for crafting the BoP trinket [![Smoking Heart of the Mountain](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gem_bloodstone_01.gif) Smoking Heart of the Mountain](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11811/smoking-heart-of-the-mountain), which is the second best mitigation trinket in the game after [![Mark of Tyranny](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_09.gif) Mark of Tyranny](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13966/mark-of-tyranny). Crafting SHotM is especially useful for Ferals who opt for taking [![Blackhand's Breadth](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_armorkit_09.gif) Blackhand's Breadth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13965/blackhands-breadth) instead of [![Mark of Tyranny](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_09.gif) Mark of Tyranny](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13966/mark-of-tyranny) when completing [![General Drakkisath's Demise](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/quest-start.gif) General Drakkisath's Demise](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5102/general-drakkisaths-demise) / [![For The Horde!](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/quest-start.gif) For The Horde!](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4974/for-the-horde) as part of their [Onyxia's Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2159/onyxias-lair) [attunement](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/onyxia-onyxias-lair-attunement-drakefire-amulet-wow-classic). Even if you choose [![Mark of Tyranny](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_09.gif) Mark of Tyranny](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13966/mark-of-tyranny), however, [![Smoking Heart of the Mountain](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gem_bloodstone_01.gif) Smoking Heart of the Mountain](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11811/smoking-heart-of-the-mountain) will be the superior defensive trinket choice on fights with a mixture of both physical and magical damage, such as the [Ragnaros](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11502/ragnaros), [Vaelastrasz the Corrupt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=13020/vaelastrasz-the-corrupt), and [Firemaw](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11983/firemaw) encounters. Once you craft your SHotM, it is recommended to drop Enchanting so that you can pick up Blacksmithing (see below), since you do not need to keep Enchanting trained in order to equip the trinket.

### [Blacksmithing](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/blacksmithing-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Blacksmithing is required for crafting the very useful utility trinket [![Glimmering Mithril Insignia](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_02.gif) Glimmering Mithril Insignia](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10418/glimmering-mithril-insignia), and must be permanently trained in order to equip and use the trinket. Horde Ferals will get the most use out of this trinket due to the lack of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_excorcism.gif) Fear Ward](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=6346/fear-ward) for mitigating Fear mechanics in Horde raids. Fears are especially detrimental when tanking raid bosses, as they cause the boss to temporarily swap targets to the next highest person on Threat until you regain control of your character. The following are examples of vanilla raid bosses with Fear mechanics that must be mitigated using a combination of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_excorcism.gif) Fear Ward](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=6346/fear-ward) / [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_tremortotem.gif) Tremor Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=8143/tremor-totem) and [![Glimmering Mithril Insignia](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_02.gif) Glimmering Mithril Insignia](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10418/glimmering-mithril-insignia): [Onyxia](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=10184/onyxia), [Magmadar](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11982/magmadar), [Nefarian](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11583/nefarian), [Princess Yauj](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15543/princess-yauj), and [Gluth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15932/gluth). Outside of its PvE value, the Blacksmithing trinket is also extremely useful in PvP, for example when carrying flags in Warsong Gulch.  
  
Blacksmithing also provides a big quality of life benefit for Ferals by allowing you to craft and apply your own [![Iron Counterweight](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_orb_01.gif) Iron Counterweight](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6043/iron-counterweight)s to your Pummelers. Counterweights are worth *over 75 AP equivalent* in value for bear TPS, making them easily worth the effort and gold to craft. Somewhat counterintuitively, the 3% Haste buff applies to your melee attacks while shapeshifted, and scales multiplicatively with both the 50% Haste from MCP as well as the three 1% Haste armor enchants. Counterweights are also quite cheap to craft, so it is actually practical to apply one to each of your Pummelers every week without breaking the bank.
