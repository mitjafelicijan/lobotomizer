When many players think of Vanilla WoW, the first class they think of is the Warrior. Warriors are the strongest damage dealers and the quintessential tanks of WoW Classic. They can usually be found in large numbers on the front lines of any raid group, dominating both the damage meters and the threat meter.

These Rage-fueled fighters can be any race in the game and can wield any weapon except for Wands. While they are slow levelers and heavily gear dependent, they are sturdy and capable at endgame. As tanks, they have the most options for both threat and survivability. As DPS, they offer a combination of high damage potential and the ability to throw on a shield for extra defense. They are also prime candidates for the game’s most famous legendary weapon, [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19019).

Roles and Specializations
-------------------------

The three talent trees for Warriors are **Arms**, **Fury**, and **Protection**.

* **Arms**
  + Focuses on talents that improve two-handed weapon damage, Rage efficiency, and utility.
  + Arms is generally considered to be an inferior tree for DPS than Fury, but it does offer some added utility.
* **Fury**
  + Offers talents that improve dual wielding and burst damage.
  + Fury Warriors are the strongest damage dealers in the game and most raids will welcome several of them.
  + Fury tanks are a little less sturdy than their Protection counterparts, but make up for it with their high damage and threat, and are often considered the best tanks when their gear (and the gear of their healers) allows for it.
* **Protection**
  + Includes talents for increasing threat generation and survivability.
  + Protection Warriors are the optimal tanks for most situations. Most raid groups will want a Prot Warrior as their main tank.

Class Feature: Stances
----------------------

Warriors have a few different Stance abilities that provide them with passive benefits. They can switch between these stances on the fly, a strategy that is referred to as “stance dancing.”

[Berserker Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2458) offers increased damage output at the cost of some survivability. [Defensive Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/71) does the opposite as well as increasing the Warrior’s threat generation. [Battle Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2457) offers a neutral option that keeps everything at its baseline level.

Class Feature: Shouts
---------------------

Warriors also have a few Shout abilities that have various effects on their allies or enemies.

[Battle Shout](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/6192) offers an Attack Power buff to the Warrior and nearby allies that lasts for two minutes.

The Warrior can also use [Intimidating Shout](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5246) to send enemies running in fear, [Demoralizing Shout](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/6190) to reduce their attack power, and [Challenging Shout](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1161) to taunt an entire group of mobs.

Resources
---------

Warriors use **Rage** as their main ability resource.

Races
-----

Warriors are the only class that can play as any race in the game.

I've been playing World of Warcraft on and off since vanilla, usually as a healer or caster and often as a guild leader. I play both retail and classic. I also love RPGs, sandboxes, and sims.
