The Paladin class is exclusive to the Alliance faction in WoW Classic, just as the Shaman is exclusive to Horde. These wielders of the Light are hybrids who can tank, heal, or deal damage. They are extremely sturdy and offer strong support in groups, but suffer from “the hybrid tax,” with other classes generally outperforming them in any given role. Despite this, they are still sought out for raids due to the buffs they bring for the rest of the group.

Paladins bring buffs for just about any situation, with Blessings that improve their teammates’ stats and Auras that buff their resistances. They also bring many of the strongest defensive cooldowns in the game, including [Blessing of Sacrifice](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/6940), [Blessing of Protection](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5599), [Divine Intervention](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19752), [Divine Protection](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5573), [Divine Shield](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/642), and [Lay on Hands](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/633). The Paladin is also able to avoid some of the cost that is incurred by most characters when purchasing mounts due to having their own special summoned mounts.

Roles and Specializations
-------------------------

The three talent trees for Paladins are **Holy**, **Protection**, and **Retribution**.

* **Holy**
  + Offers talents to buff the Paladin’s healing and the damage of their Holy spells.
  + Holy Paladins are strong single-target healers and are welcome in most raids.
* **Protection**
  + Provides talents to improve the Paladin’s survivability and threat generation.
  + Paladins are considered the weakest tanks in raids due to their struggles with mana and threat generation in Vanilla WoW. But this specialization is often used in dungeons or for solo farming due to its strong AoE and survivability.
* **Retribution**
  + This tree enhances the Paladin’s melee damage capabilities.
  + Ret Paladins are among the weakest damage specializations in the game. If a raid brings one it will be for their Paladin buffs and not for their damage output.

View the complete Paladin talent tree in our [Paladin Talent Calculator](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/tools/talent-calculator/paladin).

Class Feature: Blessings and Auras
----------------------------------

Paladins bring a wide variety of buffs for themselves and their allies. Their Blessings include a few highly useful short-term cooldowns, [Blessing of Freedom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1044), [Blessing of Protection](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5599), and [Blessing of Sacrifice](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/6940). They also have a variety of long term Blessings as well as Auras, which affect anyone near them:

* [Blessing of Kings](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20217)
* [Blessing of Light](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19977)
* [Blessing of Might](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19835)
* [Blessing of Salvation](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1038)
* [Blessing of Sanctuary](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20911)
* [Blessing of Wisdom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19850)

* [Concentration Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19746)
* [Devotion Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/643)
* [Fire Resistance Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19891)
* [Frost Resistance Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19888)
* [Retribution Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7294)
* [Sanctity Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20218)
* [Shadow Resistance Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19876)

Each Paladin can have one Aura active and one Blessing up on any given character. Groups often bring multiple Paladins and assign them to different buffs so that the raid can benefit from many of them at once. Maintaining their assigned buffs is a significant part of the Paladin’s job in group content.

Class Feature: Seals
--------------------

In addition to their group buffs, Paladins also have Seals which only affect themselves. Using the correct Seal is important for being effective in your role. Each Seal offers consistent effects as well as a secondary effect when the Paladin uses their [Judgement](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20271) ability.

* [Seal of the Crusader](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20305)
* [Seal of Justice](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20164)
* [Seal of Righteousness](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20288)
* [Seal of Command](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20375)
* [Seal of Light](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20165)
* [Seal of Wisdom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20166)

“Seal twisting” is a method that is often used in order to benefit from more than one Seal by alternating them as part of the Paladin’s overall rotation. This strategy is particularly important for Retribution Paladins who wish to maximize their damage output.

Resources

Paladins use **Mana** as their main ability resource.

#### Luxrah

I've been playing World of Warcraft on and off since vanilla, usually as a healer or caster and often as a guild leader. I play both retail and classic. I also love RPGs, sandboxes, and sims.
