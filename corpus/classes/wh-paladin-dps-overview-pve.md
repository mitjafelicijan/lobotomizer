Viability of DPS Retribution Paladins in WoW Classic PvE Content
----------------------------------------------------------------

Due to their low damage, Ret Paladins are not generally found in most raid groups. The vast majority of Paladins will choose to raid as Holy for easier access to a raid spot, but some Ret Paladins will find guilds or groups to run with. If a group decides to bring a Ret Paladin, usually it will be one at most and will be because of a missing Blessing from not enough Holy Paladins. If you want to raid as a Ret Paladin, know that it will be an uphill battle, and finding a group to consistently run with will be a challenge.  
  
Holy Paladins are among the very best healers in Classic, and unlike Shaman who need to spec fairly deep into Enhancement in order to increase the value of their buffs, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_fistofjustice.gif) Improved Blessing of Might](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20042/improved-blessing-of-might) is at the very top of the Retribution tree where any build can access it.

---

Strengths of Classic DPS Retribution Paladins
---------------------------------------------

#### * Powerful raid buffs

Paladin is one of the biggest reasons that many guilds and players choose to play Alliance. Paladins bring powerful buffs such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_fistofjustice.gif) Blessing of Might](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19837/blessing-of-might) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_magearmor.gif) Blessing of Kings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20217/blessing-of-kings) that are huge for damage, mana gain, and survivability in a raid.

#### * Extremely powerful cooldowns

Paladins have many powerful cooldowns that can easily change the outcome of a fight. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_divineintervention.gif) Divine Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=642/divine-shield) is perhaps the most notorious Paladin spell. It can make you immune to all damage for 10 seconds, allowing you to heal yourself or finish off your opponent without worrying about anything they could do. Other spells like [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_layonhands.gif) Lay on Hands](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=633/lay-on-hands) can instant heal a target to full health, or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofvalor.gif) Blessing of Freedom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1044/blessing-of-freedom) which can make the target immune to all movement impairing effects for 10 seconds. Paladins have more cooldowns that almost any class in the game, some of which are arguably among the most powerful spells in the game.

#### * Incredibly durable in PvP

Due to their plate armor and strong defensive cooldowns, Paladins are incredibly durable in PvP. With [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_renew.gif) Cleanse](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=4987/cleanse) to dispel magic effects, strong healing, and other powerful cooldowns, Paladins are hard to bring down. This makes Ret Paladins extremely effective in the open world, either solo or in a group.

#### * Relatively easy to gear

Ret Paladins are the only end game DPS specialization that uses 2H weapons as their primary weapon. Warriors are the only other class that can use 2H weapons as their primary weapon, but most will choose to play fury, meaning they will be going for 1H weapons. As a plate wearer, you will also be able to make use of every armor type when putting together your pre-raid BiS, giving you more options than most classes.

---

Weaknesses of Classic DPS Retribution Paladins
----------------------------------------------

#### * Not very mobile

While [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofvalor.gif) Blessing of Freedom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1044/blessing-of-freedom) is powerful for getting rid of roots and slows, you do not have any movement speed increases. This means that if someone wants to kite or chase you, you have no way to outrun them besides using a control ability like [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofmight.gif) Hammer of Justice](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=853/hammer-of-justice) to stun them before running away. This can make solo PvP quite tricky against ranged classes especially, and if you do not have cooldowns available, winning can be almost impossible while alone.

#### * Low sustained damage

Ret Paladins are going to be at the bottom of the DPS meters in most raids. At every phase, other DPS like rogues and warriors will be far superior for damage in raids. For this reason, Ret Paladins are a rarity in most raid groups. In PvP, you have a high potential for burst if your auto attacks and seal procs crit, but you sustained damage in any PvE environment will be on the lower end.

Best Races for PvE WoW Classic DPS Retribution Paladins
-------------------------------------------------------

Paladins can only be two Alliance Races: [![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) and [![Dwarf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_dwarf_male.gif) Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf).

| [Undead Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Best Race for Alliance DPS Retribution Paladins

Paladin is a unique faction for the Alliance, meaning if you want to play a Paladin, you must be Alliance. Your choice of race as a Paladin is between [![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) and [![Dwarf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_dwarf_male.gif) Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf), and [![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) is going to be significantly better for PvE, while PvP comes down to personal preference.

#### [Human Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) Paladin

Humans are significantly better for PvE due to the extra weapon skill from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_05.gif) Mace Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20864/mace-specialization) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_meleedamage.gif) Sword Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20597/sword-specialization). Extra weapon skill as a melee means a lower chance to miss, a lower chance to get glancing blows, and a lower chance to have your attacks dodged. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_note_02.gif) Diplomacy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20599/diplomacy) is also an excellent time-saver for when you need to earn reputation for gear, mounts, and patterns at level 60. Humans are decent in PvP because of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20600/perception), which will let you potentially see a Rogue before they open on you if you use the ability when they are nearby. However, because you need to activate [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20600/perception) in order to use it, it is incredibly situational and can be challenging to make use of.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_note_02.gif) Diplomacy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20599/diplomacy): Reputation gains increased by 10%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_05.gif) Mace Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20864/mace-specialization): Skill with Maces and Two-Handed Maces increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20600/perception): Dramatically increases stealth detection for 20 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_meleedamage.gif) Sword Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20597/sword-specialization): Skill with Swords and Two-Handed Swords increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_shardbrilliantsmall.gif) The Human Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20598/the-human-spirit): Spirit increased by 5%.

#### [Dwarf Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) Paladin

While Dwarves provide no benefits for PvE, they can be good for PvP. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform) is an extremely powerful ability that can change the course of a fight when a Rogue or Warrior is attacking you by allowing you to drop their bleeds and poisons, which includes [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_mindsteal.gif) Blind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2094/blind). Eventually, in AQ40 [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform) will be useful due to the high number of poison debuffs, but will rarely be needed in other dungeons or raids.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_dwarf_findtreasure.gif) Find Treasure](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2481/find-treasure): Allows the dwarf to sense nearby treasure, making it appear on the minimap
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_wizardmark.gif) Frost Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20596/frost-resistance): Increases Frost Resistance by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_musket_03.gif) Gun Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20595/gun-specialization): Guns skill increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform): While active, grants immunity to Bleed, Poison, and Disease effects. In addition, Armor increased by 10%. Lasts 8 sec.

### Best Race for Horde DPS Retribution Paladins

Paladins cannot be Horde. Horde instead has Shaman as their own unique class.

WoW Classic DPS Retribution Specializations
-------------------------------------------

There are three specialization talent trees for Classic Paladins: Holy is healing-focused, Protection tank-focused, and Retribution DPS-focused. Classes in Classic WoW will earn a total of 51 talent points, allowing them to take talents from multiple trees.   
  
Â **Holy:** Invokes the power of the Light to protect and to heal.

* [Holy Shock builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/paladin/healer-talent-builds-pve#standard-pve) form the basis of most healing builds, providing a strong burst of instant damage or healing suitable for PvE and PvP. Multiple variants exist, picking up [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_mindsooth.gif) Improved Concentration Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20256/improved-concentration-aura) for caster groups or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_lightningshield.gif) Blessing of Sanctuary](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20911/blessing-of-sanctuary) for tank mitigation.

Â **Protection:** Uses Holy magic to shield themselves and defend allies from attackers.

* [Holy Shield builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/lights-bulwark-protection-paladin-tanking#talents) dip into all three trees in order to pick up [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_innerfire.gif) Consecration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=26573/consecration) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_windwalkon.gif) Benediction](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20105/benediction), though there are several choices which can be made to increase threat generation or survivability. While their AoE threat in dungeons can be very strong, the lack of a taunt and ranged pull are Protection's biggest weakness, though both can be overcome through proper positioning and threat management. Mana is also a unique consideration among the tanking specializations, causing the Paladin to frequently downrank spells, prioritize MP5, and have to drink between pulls.

Â **Retribution:** A righteous crusader who judges and punishes opponents with weapons and Holy magic.

* [Repentance builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/paladin/dps-pvp-arena#ret-paladin-pvp) are viable in PvP builds capable of dealing damage while still supporting their allies with several different buffs and auras to increase armor or elemental resistance depending on the situation. Variants investing into the Protection tree for [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofstrength.gif) Reckoning](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20182/reckoning) provide extra burst, but gives up the defensive benefits of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_prayerofhealing.gif) Repentance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20066/repentance) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_arcane_blink.gif) Spiritual Focus](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20205/spiritual-focus) in order to do so. While [PvE variants](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/paladin/dps-talent-builds-pve#blessing-of-kings) exist, they're typically seen as below average damage dealers and frequently scorned.

### Best Builds for Retribution Paladins

Most DPS Paladin builds typically invest the majority of their points in the Retribution tree, while taking only select bonuses in the Protection and Holy trees.  
  
Viable end-game PvE builds are covered in our [Classic DPS Retribution Paladin Talents & Builds Guide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/paladin/dps-talent-builds-pve).

Best Professions for DPS Retribution Paladins
---------------------------------------------

Unlike in other versions of WoW, professions in Classic do not offer any direct combat benefits just for having them. For the most part, you should choose professions that you enjoy, or perhaps even more importantly, will make you gold. Gold is an incredibly important part of Classic due to the many important and expensive purchases that you will need to make. Epic riding, gear, and consumables such as potions for raiding and PvP are among those purchases. Most professions can help you make gold in some way, but gathering professions such as Mining, Herbalism, and Skinning are always great choices.

### [Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

While most professions do not offer combat benefits, Engineering is the exception. Engineers get access to tons of powerful bombs, tools, and trinkets that can be incredibly strong, especially in PvP. Trinkets such as [![Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_04.gif) Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18638/hyper-radiant-flame-reflector), [![Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_02.gif) Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18634/gyrofreeze-ice-reflector), and [![Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_16.gif) Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18639/ultra-flash-shadow-reflector) allow you to reflect spells of a specific type when used, which can easily change the outcome of a fight. Grenades such as [![Iron Grenade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_08.gif) Iron Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4390/iron-grenade) are critical for stunning a target from range, letting you interrupt a cast or run away in a bad situation. There are also tons of miscellaneous items and pieces of gear like [![Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_49.gif) Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10588/goblin-rocket-helmet), which have different special effects and uses in PvP situations. Engineering is one of the most popular professions in Classic, and for a good reason. If you plan to PvP or raid anything more than casually, Engineering is almost a requirement due to the strength of the consumables that it brings.  
  
As a melee DPS, [![Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_polymorphchicken.gif) Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10725/gnomish-battle-chicken) is also a powerful trinket due to its proc that can increase the melee haste of all other party members when the chicken becomes enraged.
