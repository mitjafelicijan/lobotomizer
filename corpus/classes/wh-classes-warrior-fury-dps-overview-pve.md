Viability of DPS Warriors in WoW Classic PvE Content
----------------------------------------------------

Warriors are the best class in Classic World of Warcraft, scaling well with proper gear and buff support. Good Warriors are always able to find a group to play with in both PVE and PVP. For PVE you will often see upwards of 20 Warriors in a single raid, this is because they take advantage of each faction's unique buffs to the fullest extent.   
  
As Horde, Warriors are the best class at abusing [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=27621/windfury-totem) gaining extra attacks and extra rage from an otherwise underwhelming attack ([![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_shockwave.gif) Hamstring](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1715/hamstring)); As Alliance, you get access to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_magearmor.gif) Blessing of Kings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20217/blessing-of-kings) which makes everything just a bit easier, even for tanks the extra agility and stamina allow you to transition into the popular fury tank spec earlier. So, whether you are looking to excel in PVE or PVP, you can't go wrong with Warrior.

---

Strengths of Classic DPS Warriors
---------------------------------

#### * Warriors scale well with gear:

Out of any class in the game you won't find one that scales anywhere near as well as Warriors, with the right armor and an appropriate set of weapons, they are always going to be one of the highest performing classes in the raid.[/li][/ul]

#### * Strong in Both PVE and PVP:

As just stated, with the right gear Warriors are capable in both PVE and PVP. If a Warrior has the right amount of support, they can transform into an unstoppable force.

#### * The only "true" tank class:

Although [Druids](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/feral/tank-overview-pve) and [Paladins](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/lights-bulwark-protection-paladin-tanking) have tank specs, Warriors are the only true tank class, and as such they are best suited for this crucial role, even when not specced into the protection tree Warriors can be potent tanks.

Weaknesses of Classic DPS Warriors
----------------------------------

#### * Gear dependent:

On the flip side of "scaling well" is being gear dependent, if you find yourself in a world (of Warcraft) where you are behind in gear compared to the general player base then you aren't going to live up to a true Warrior's potential.

#### * Requires support:

Warriors aren't the most independent class, and in PVP especially they are considered the worst 1v1 class, they are extremely susceptible to being kited, they have minimal access to crowd control abilities, and without a healer they are quite lacking in sustain.

#### * One of the worst levelers:

Especially if you plan on leveling a Warrior solo, you are going to have a rough time with leveling. Since Warriors lack sustain, you will often have to eat to full life in between just 1 or 2 mobs.

### Best Race for Alliance DPS Warriors

[![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) is the best Classic WoW Alliance DPS Warrior race for PvE. [![Gnome](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_gnome_male.gif) Gnome](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=7/gnome) or [![Dwarf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_dwarf_male.gif) Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) is the best Classic WoW Alliance DPS Warrior race For PvP.  
  
Alliance [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) have the benefit of Raiding with a Paladin, which can Buff the Warrior with powerful Blessings such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_fistofjustice.gif) Blessing of Might](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25291/blessing-of-might) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_magearmor.gif) Blessing of Kings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20217/blessing-of-kings). The strength of playing Warrior on Alliance comes from these buffs as it actually changes the game because you can count on having these buffs in raid you can gear in anticipation of having 10% more of your total stats.

#### [Human Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) Warrior

Humans are, without a doubt, the best PvE Raiding Alliance Race, because of their incredible Racials [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_meleedamage.gif) Sword Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20597/sword-specialization) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_05.gif) Mace Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20864/mace-specialization). Having a higher Weapon Skill reduces the odds you will miss an attack, as well as reduce the chance the target can block, dodge, or parry it. Weapon Skill goes an incredibly long way in PvE content, increasing your overall damage by a significant margin. As for PvP, Humans are decent. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20600/perception) can increase your chance of getting the opener versus a [![Rogue](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_rogue.gif) Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue) in the world. Of course, you can always catch a [![Druid](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_druid.gif) Druid](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=11/druid) who is [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Prowl](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9913/prowl)ing nearby, as well.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_note_02.gif) Diplomacy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20599/diplomacy): Reputation gains increased by 10%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_05.gif) Mace Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20864/mace-specialization): Skill with Maces and Two-Handed Maces increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20600/perception): Dramatically increases stealth detection for 20 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_meleedamage.gif) Sword Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20597/sword-specialization): Skill with Swords and Two-Handed Swords increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_shardbrilliantsmall.gif) The Human Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20598/the-human-spirit): Spirit increased by 5%.

#### [Dwarf Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) Warrior

Dwarves are one of the best PvP races for a Warrior. The Racial mostly helps against the [![Rogue](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_rogue.gif) Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue) class, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform) will allow you to remove all poison effects on you, but more importantly, it allows the Dwarf to break out of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_mindsteal.gif) Blind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2094/blind), even while Blinded! [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform) has other uses as well, allowing the Dwarf to remove a [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) Bleeds, or even an [![Undead](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_scourge_male.gif) Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) Class Racial, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_blackplague.gif) Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19280/devouring-plague)! It is instrumental to have [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform) to remove damage over time effects. As for PvE Raiding, Dwarf has only minor benefits. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform) can be used in situations where you are affected by an appropriate debuff; you can also use it to gain 10% armor and be a little more durable from physical attacks.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_dwarf_findtreasure.gif) Find Treasure](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2481/find-treasure): Allows the dwarf to sense nearby treasure, making it appear on the minimap
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_wizardmark.gif) Frost Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20596/frost-resistance): Increases Frost Resistance by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_musket_03.gif) Gun Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20595/gun-specialization): Guns skill increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform): While active, grants immunity to Bleed, Poison, and Disease effects. In addition, Armor increased by 10%. Lasts 8 sec.

#### [Night Elf Night Elf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=4/night-elf) Warrior

Night Elf has nearly no benefits for a Warrior. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Shadowmeld](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20580/shadowmeld) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_shadowmeld.gif) Quickness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20582/quickness) don't do much while choosing to play Night Elf doesn't have much of an impact in PvE or PvP, Night Elves do start with the highest Agility of any of the Races, but this is a reasonably minor benefit. Compared to Dwarves, the Night Elf will always have nine more Agility, even in matching Gear. I would not recommend going Night Elf as a Warrior.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritarmor.gif) Nature Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20583/nature-resistance): Nature Resistance increased by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Wisp Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20585/wisp-spirit): Transform into a wisp upon death, increasing movement speed by 50%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_shadowmeld.gif) Quickness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20582/quickness): Dodge chance increased by 1%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Shadowmeld](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20580/shadowmeld): Activate to slip into the shadows, reducing the chance for enemies to detect your presence. Lasts until cancelled or upon moving. Night Elf Rogues and Druids with Shadowmeld are more difficult to detect while stealthed or prowling.

#### [Gnome Gnome](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=7/gnome) Warrior

Gnomes are considered the best Alliance PvP race for Warrior. One of the easiest ways to control a Warrior is to use immobilize effects, such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_frostnova.gif) Frost Nova](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10230/frost-nova), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_stranglevines.gif) Entangling Roots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9853/entangling-roots), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_shockwave.gif) Improved Hamstring](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23695/improved-hamstring), or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_trip.gif) Improved Wing Clip](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19235/improved-wing-clip). For Warriors, it is incredibly useful to be able to free yourself from crowd control effects as you aren't able to deal much damage outside of melee range if you're interested in PVP especially Gnome should be a strong consideration for you. As for PvE Raiding, Gnome has no benefits.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Arcane Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20592/arcane-resistance): Arcane Resistance increased.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_essenceeternallarge.gif) Expansive Mind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20591/expansive-mind): Intelligence increased by 5%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gear_01.gif) Engineering Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20593/engineering-specialization): Engineering skill increased by 15.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_trip.gif) Escape Artist](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20589/escape-artist): Escape the effects of any immobilization or movement speed reduction effect.

### Best Race for Horde DPS Warriors

[![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) or [![Troll](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_troll_male.gif) Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) is the best Classic WoW Horde DPS Warrior race for PvE. [![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) or [![Tauren](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_tauren_male.gif) Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren) is the best Classic WoW Horde DPS Warrior race For PvP.  
  
Horde [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) have the benefit of Raiding with a Shaman, which has access to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=27621/windfury-totem), an insanely powerful boost to a Warrior's damage output. The biggest advantage that a Horde Warrior gains is being able to use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_shockwave.gif) Hamstring](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1715/hamstring) to trigger [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=27621/windfury-totem), this will give you extra auto attacks increasing your rage generation as well as your overall DPS Output.

#### [Orc Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) Warrior

Orc is one of the best PvP Races in the game. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_23.gif) Hardiness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20573/hardiness) is so powerful, Blizzard had no choice but to nerf it a total of **three** times, leading up to Warlords of Draenor. Now that Classic is releasing, the true power of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_23.gif) Hardiness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20573/hardiness) will be realized once again. Every character in World of Warcraft has a base 5% chance to resist a Stun effect. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_23.gif) Hardiness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20573/hardiness) increases your Stun resist chance, effectively giving the Orc a 30% chance to Resist incoming Stuns. Things like [![Iron Grenade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_08.gif) Iron Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4390/iron-grenade), [![Tidal Charm](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_rune_01.gif) Tidal Charm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=1404/tidal-charm), or even an enemy Rogue's [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_kidneyshot.gif) Kidney Shot](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=8643/kidney-shot), all can be resisted. As for PvE, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_orc_berserkerstrength.gif) Blood Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20572/blood-fury) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_02.gif) Axe Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20574/axe-specialization) set Orc apart as the dominant choice for Warriors, weapon skill, in particular, can be a critical stat as it affects the rest of your gear choices.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_02.gif) Axe Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20574/axe-specialization) - Skill with Axes and Two-Handed Axes increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_orc_berserkerstrength.gif) Blood Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20572/blood-fury) - Increases base melee attack power by 25% for 15 sec and reduces healing effects on you by 50% for 25 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_warcry.gif) Command](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20575/command) - Damage dealt by Hunter and Warlock pets increased by 5%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_23.gif) Hardiness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20573/hardiness) - Chance to resist Stun effects increased by an additional 25%.

#### [Undead Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) Warrior

Undead is an incredible niche pick for a Warrior because [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_raisedead.gif) Will of the Forsaken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=7744/will-of-the-forsaken) makes you exceptionally well-positioned against Warlocks, but beyond that, you don't have much of a reason to pick Undead for PVP unless you enjoy the aesthetics. For PVE, WotF can be an extra tool to handle fear mechanics from bosses such as Nefarian and Onyxia. While a very cool race, I wouldn't recommend going Undead for any gameplay reasons.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_cannibalize.gif) Cannibalize](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20577/cannibalize): When activated, regenerates 7% of total health every 2 sec for 10 sec. Only works on Humanoid or Undead corpses within 5 yds. Any movement, action, or damage taken while Cannibalizing will cancel the effect.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_detectinvisibility.gif) Shadow Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20579/shadow-resistance): Shadow Resistance increased by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_demonbreath.gif) Underwater Breathing](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=5227/underwater-breathing): Underwater breath lasts 300% longer than normal.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_raisedead.gif) Will of the Forsaken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=7744/will-of-the-forsaken): Provides immunity to Charm, Fear and Sleep while active. May also be used while already afflicted by Charm, Fear or Sleep. Lasts 5 sec.

#### [Tauren Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren) Warrior

As we learn more about Classic, we have gotten official word from Blizzard themselves that Taurens have an increased hitbox as well as a little bit of extra reach for their melee attacks. With this new bonus to Tauren, the race becomes an incredibly viable choice for PVP, along with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warstomp.gif) War Stomp](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20549/war-stomp) as an extra crowd control effect you can do some severe damage as a Tauren. For PVE Taurens don't have many benefits, they're slightly more durable because of their [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Endurance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20550/endurance) racial, but even with 10,000 life, it's only a 500 hp bonus.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_flower_01.gif) Cultivation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20552/cultivation): Herbalism skill increased by 15.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Endurance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20550/endurance): Total Health increased by 5%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritarmor.gif) Nature Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20551/nature-resistance): Nature Resistance increased by 10.

#### [Troll Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) Warrior

Right off the bat Trolls have virtually no PVP application, so let's talk about how good they are in PVE. Trolls are the best primary tank race because they will get an extra two heroic strikes in their opening rotation from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_troll_berserk.gif) Berserking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=26296/berserking), which provides a more significant lead on threat. Trolls are also one of the best leveling races because of their other two racial abilities [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_regenerate.gif) Regeneration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20555/regeneration) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pelt_bear_ruin_02.gif) Beast Slaying](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20557/beast-slaying). So, if you're someone who enjoys tanking and doesn't care about being a "neutral" race for PvP, you should consider Troll.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pelt_bear_ruin_02.gif) Beast Slaying](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20557/beast-slaying): Damage dealt versus Beasts increased by 5%.

WoW Classic DPS Warrior Specializations
---------------------------------------

There are three specialization talent trees for Classic Warriors: Arms and Fury provide DPS benefits, while Protection provides Tank benefits.   
  
Classes in Classic WoW will earn a total of 51 talent points, allowing them to take talents from multiple trees, though most builds typically invest the majority of their points in one tree, while taking only select bonuses in the others. All three Warrior talent trees are strong in their own right, with several viable talent combinations, depending on whether the player is interested in PvP, dealing damage, or tanking.   
  
 **Arms:** A battle-hardened master of two-handed weapons, using mobility and overpowering attacks to strike their opponents down.

* [Mortal Strike builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/warrior/fury/dps-talent-builds-pve#standard-arms-pvp) are a PvP mainstay, and also perform quite well in dungeons and while leveling, due to only requiring a single weapon, high immediate damage of each strike, and multitarget cooldown [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_slicedice.gif) Sweeping Strikes](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12292/sweeping-strikes). Not very common in raids however, due to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_savageblow.gif) Mortal Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12294/mortal-strike) taking up a precious debuff slot.

 **Fury:** A furious berserker of wielding a weapon in each hand, unleashing a flurry of attacks to carve their opponents to pieces.

* [Dual-wielding builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/warrior/fury/dps-talent-builds-pve#standard-dw-fury) are the primary raid setup due to their strong sustained damage and the powerful cooldown [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_deathpact.gif) Death Wish](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12328/death-wish), although most players will not switch to dual-wielding until right before entering raids, as it requires more investment in proper weapons and +hit gear.

 **Protection:** A stalwart protector who uses a shield to safeguard themselves and their allies.

* [Shield Slam builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classic-warrior-pve-tanking#low-geared-deep-prot-12-5-34) are the premier tanking setup, capable of generating high threat, with an extra survivability cooldown in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_ashestoashes.gif) Last Stand](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12975/last-stand), and multiple stuns. There are several other variations available, including builds that focus much more on damage.

### Best DPS Warrior Spec for PvE in WoW Classic

For Classic end-game content, Fury is the best spec for DPS Warriors. They will either use a slow 2H weapon with a [Slam build](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/warrior/fury/dps-talent-builds-pve#slam-specs) or use two 1H weapons with high DPS as [Dual-Wield Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/warrior/fury/dps-talent-builds-pve#standard-dw-fury).   
  
For [PvP](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/warrior/fury/dps-pvp-arena), DPS Warriors will use a slow 2H weapon for an [Arms Mortal Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/warrior/fury/dps-pvp-arena#standard-arms-pvp) build.  
  
Viable end-game PvE builds are covered in our [Classic DPS Warrior Talents & Builds Guide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/warrior/fury/dps-talent-builds-pve).

Best Professions for Classic DPS Warriors
-----------------------------------------

### [Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Engineering is an absolute must-have if you are trying to go the extra mile in PvE or PvP. In PvE, you should go [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/trade_engineering.gif) Gnomish Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20220/gnomish-engineering), allowing you to craft [![Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_polymorphchicken.gif) Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10725/gnomish-battle-chicken), a Bind on Pickup Trinket that summons a Pet. After being summoned, the Battle Chicken will attack the nearest target and has a chance on hit to trigger a Battle shout, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_birdbeck_01.gif) Battle Squawk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23060/battle-squawk), which increases the Melee Attack Speed by all party members by 5%. Also in PvE, you will be able to use [![Dense Dynamite](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_06.gif) Dense Dynamite](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18641/dense-dynamite), a bomb that deals ~400 damage, which only has a cooldown of 60 seconds, which can be a significant boost in damage.  
  
In PvP, Engineering changes everything. Because Warriors can only do damage within Melee range, many classes will try to "kite" the Warrior by applying Slows or Immobilization effects and creating distance. With something like [![Iron Grenade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_08.gif) Iron Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4390/iron-grenade), a Warrior can Stun the target and allow the Warrior to catch up, allowing the Warrior to continue dealing damage. There is also the super-powerful [![Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_49.gif) Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10588/goblin-rocket-helmet), a Helmet item that will enable you to charge a target and "knocking them silly," which is an incapacitate effect that lasts for over 10 seconds. This can be a great tool to close the distance, as well as a great way to keep a target Crowd Controlled for a more extended period.  
  
I also can't mention Engineering and PvP without talking about the Reflector Trinkets. [![Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_04.gif) Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18638/hyper-radiant-flame-reflector), [![Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_02.gif) Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18634/gyrofreeze-ice-reflector), and [![Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_16.gif) Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18639/ultra-flash-shadow-reflector). These Trinkets allow the Warrior to "reflect" various Spells back at the caster. Things like [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_fireball02.gif) Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18809/pyroblast), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_frostbolt02.gif) Frostbolt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25304/frostbolt), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_deathcoil.gif) Death Coil](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17926/death-coil). These can be massively game-changing moments that can turn the tide toward the Warrior's favor if timed properly. The Reflect Buff only lasts for 5 seconds and has a noticeable effect on the Warrior's body, notifying all enemies the Reflector is on (that is if they are paying attention). Lastly, [![Goblin Sapper Charge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Sapper Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge) is a massive burst of damage. With this Consumable, a Warrior can easily burst a target down.
