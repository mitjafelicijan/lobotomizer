Viability of Paladin Healers in WoW Classic PvE Content
-------------------------------------------------------

Paladins are not only viable but required for serious raiding and PvP. In raids, their mana efficiency and powerful buffs make them ideal healers to the point where most raids choose to bring at least 4, sometimes more. In PvP, their powerful cooldowns and durability make them an exceptional choice for healing and optimal for being on the front lines supporting your team's melee. Paladins are an excellent choice for Alliance players who want to be in an indispensable raid role with the cooldowns and fortitude needed to overcome most challenges.

---

Strengths of Classic Holy Paladins
----------------------------------

#### * Powerful raid buffs

Paladin is one of the biggest reasons that many guilds and players choose to play Alliance. Paladins bring powerful buffs such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_fistofjustice.gif) Blessing of Might](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25291/blessing-of-might) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofwisdom.gif) Blessing of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25290/blessing-of-wisdom) that are huge for damage, mana gain, and survivability in a raid. For this reason alone, having multiple Paladins is a high priority in any raid group, making it easy to find a raiding or PvP guild as a holy paladin.

#### * Fewer mana issues

Mana is the most common resource used in WoW Classic and is notoriously easy to spend on many classes. At level 60, Holy Paladin is one of the rare exceptions. Due to spells and talents such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Illumination](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20215/illumination), Paladins have fewer mana problems than other healers, which will only get better as your gear improves. Once you start to get into better raid gear you will find that you have few to no mana issues in raids, especially in later tiers.

#### * Extremely powerful cooldowns

Paladins have many powerful cooldowns that can easily change the outcome of a fight. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_divineintervention.gif) Divine Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1020/divine-shield) is perhaps the most notorious Paladin spell, and can make you immune to all damage for 12 seconds, allowing you to heal yourself or finish off your opponent without worrying about anything they could do. Other spells like [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_layonhands.gif) Lay on Hands](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10310/lay-on-hands) can instant heal a target to full health, or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofvalor.gif) Blessing of Freedom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1044/blessing-of-freedom) which can make the target immune to all movement impairing effects for 10 seconds. Paladins have more cooldowns that almost any class in the game, some of which are arguably among the most powerful spells in the game.

#### * Incredibly durable in PvP

Due to their plate armor and strong defensive cooldowns, Paladins are incredibly durable in PvP. With [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_renew.gif) Cleanse](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=4987/cleanse) to dispel magic effects, strong instant healing through [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_searinglight.gif) Holy Shock](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20930/holy-shock), and other powerful cooldowns, Paladins are hard to bring down. This makes Paladins extremely effective healers in Battlegrounds and in the open world where you can support other players.

#### * Easy to gear

Holy Paladin is the only specialization in the game that uses plate gear with spell power. Not only do you have access to a subset of armor that no one else can use, but you can make use of cloth, leather, and mail gear that has good stats. You will be able to make use of more pieces of equipment than anyone else, which makes gearing as a Holy Paladin quite easy compared to many other classes and specs.

---

Weaknesses of Classic Holy Paladins
-----------------------------------

#### * Not very mobile

While [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofvalor.gif) Blessing of Freedom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1044/blessing-of-freedom) is powerful for getting rid of roots and slows, you do not have any movement speed increases. This means that if someone wants to kite or chase you, you have no way to outrun them besides using a control ability like [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofmight.gif) Hammer of Justice](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10308/hammer-of-justice) to stun them before running away. This can make solo PvP quite tricky and is one of the reasons Paladin is much better in a group.

#### * No great damage options

While other healers have viable damage options due to their hybrid damage specs being caster based, such as Shamans have Elemental and Priests having Shadow, Paladin only has Retribution as its damage specialization. Retribution Paladins use stats like strength to get attack power to deal damage, which you will have very little of as Holy. This also means that your damage abilities require melee range mostly compared to other healing specs having ranged damage spells. This makes it almost impossible for Holy Paladin to do real damage, with the exception of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_searinglight.gif) Holy Shock](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20930/holy-shock), which means you have to choose between using it to heal and using it to deal damage and is on a 30-second cooldown.

Best Races for PvE WoW Classic Holy Paladins
--------------------------------------------

Paladins can only be two Alliance Races: [![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) and [![Dwarf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_dwarf_male.gif) Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf).

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Race** | [Druid Druid](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=11/druid) | [Hunter Hunter](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=3/hunter) | [Mage Mage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=8/mage) | [Paladin Paladin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=2/paladin) | [Priest Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) | [Rogue Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue) | [Shaman Shaman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=7/shaman) | [Warlock Warlock](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=9/warlock) | [Warrior Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) |
| [Dwarf Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Gnome Gnome](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=7/gnome) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Human Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Night Elf Night Elf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=4/night-elf) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Orc Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Tauren Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Troll Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Undead Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Best Race for Alliance Holy Paladins

Paladin is a unique faction for the Alliance, meaning if you want to play a Paladin, you must be Alliance. Your choice of race as a Paladin is between [![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) and [![Dwarf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_dwarf_male.gif) Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf), and the choice mostly comes down to your personal preference as neither race offers a significant advantage for Holy Paladins.  
  
[![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) is marginally better for PvE in WoW Classic, and [![Dwarf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_dwarf_male.gif) Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) is the best PvP Paladin race.

#### [Human Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) Paladin

Humans are marginally the best PvE race for Paladin because they give a small benefit in the form of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_shardbrilliantsmall.gif) The Human Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20598/the-human-spirit), which will increase the amount of mana that you passively generate while out of combat or by following the 5-second rule. Because Paladins do not use Spirit as their primary method of mana generation, this is a marginal gain. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_note_02.gif) Diplomacy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20599/diplomacy) is also an excellent time-saver for when you need to earn reputation for gear, mounts, and patterns at level 60. Humans are decent in PvP because of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20600/perception), which will let you potentially see a Rogue before they open on you if you use the ability when they are nearby. However, because you need to activate [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20600/perception) in order to use it, it is incredibly situational and can be challenging to make use of.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_note_02.gif) Diplomacy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20599/diplomacy): Reputation gains increased by 10%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_05.gif) Mace Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20864/mace-specialization): Skill with Maces and Two-Handed Maces increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20600/perception): Dramatically increases stealth detection for 20 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_meleedamage.gif) Sword Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20597/sword-specialization): Skill with Swords and Two-Handed Swords increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_shardbrilliantsmall.gif) The Human Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20598/the-human-spirit): Spirit increased by 5%.

#### [Dwarf Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) Paladin

While Dwarves provide no benefits for PvE, they are the best choice in PvP. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform) is an extremely powerful ability that can change the course of a fight when a Rogue or Warrior is attacking you by allowing you to drop their bleeds and poisons, which includes [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_mindsteal.gif) Blind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2094/blind). Eventually, in AQ40 [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform) will be useful due to the high number of poison debuffs, but will rarely be needed in other dungeons or raids.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_dwarf_findtreasure.gif) Find Treasure](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2481/find-treasure): Allows the dwarf to sense nearby treasure, making it appear on the minimap
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_wizardmark.gif) Frost Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20596/frost-resistance): Increases Frost Resistance by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_musket_03.gif) Gun Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20595/gun-specialization): Guns skill increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform): While active, grants immunity to Bleed, Poison, and Disease effects. In addition, Armor increased by 10%. Lasts 8 sec.

### Best Race for Horde Holy Paladins

Paladins cannot be Horde. Horde instead has Shaman as their own unique class.

WoW Classic Paladin Healer Specializations
------------------------------------------

There are three specialization talent trees for Classic Paladins: Holy is healing-focused, Protection tank-focused, and Retribution DPS-focused. Classes in Classic WoW will earn a total of 51 talent points, allowing them to take talents from multiple trees, though most builds typically invest the majority of their points in one tree, while taking only select bonuses in the others.  
  
 **Holy:** Invokes the power of the Light to protect and to heal.

* [Holy Shock builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/paladin/healer-talent-builds-pve#standard-pve) form the basis of most healing builds, providing a strong burst of instant damage or healing suitable for PvE and PvP. Multiple variants exist, picking up [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_mindsooth.gif) Improved Concentration Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20256/improved-concentration-aura) for caster groups or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_lightningshield.gif) Blessing of Sanctuary](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20911/blessing-of-sanctuary) for tank mitigation.

 **Protection:** Uses Holy magic to shield themselves and defend allies from attackers.

* [Holy Shield builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/lights-bulwark-protection-paladin-tanking#talents) dip into all three trees in order to pick up [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_innerfire.gif) Consecration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=26573/consecration) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_windwalkon.gif) Benediction](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20105/benediction), though there are several choices which can be made to increase threat generation or survivability. While their AoE threat in dungeons can be very strong, the lack of a taunt and ranged pull are Protection's biggest weakness, though both can be overcome through proper positioning and threat management. Mana is also a unique consideration among the tanking specializations, causing the Paladin to frequently downrank spells, prioritize MP5, and have to drink between pulls.

 **Retribution:** A righteous crusader who judges and punishes opponents with weapons and Holy magic.

* [Repentance builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/paladin/dps-pvp-arena#ret-paladin-pvp) are viable in PvP builds capable of dealing damage while still supporting their allies with several different buffs and auras to increase armor or elemental resistance depending on the situation. Variants investing into the Protection tree for [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofstrength.gif) Reckoning](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20182/reckoning) provide extra burst, but gives up the defensive benefits of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_prayerofhealing.gif) Repentance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20066/repentance) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_arcane_blink.gif) Spiritual Focus](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20205/spiritual-focus) in order to do so. While [PvE variants](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/paladin/dps-talent-builds-pve#blessing-of-kings) exist, they're typically seen as below average damage dealers and frequently scorned.

### Best Builds for Holy Paladins

Healing Paladins will invest most of their points into the Holy tree, in a standard PvE 35/11/5 Talent Build setup, although points can be swapped around if you must provide [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_lightningshield.gif) Blessing of Sanctuary](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20911/blessing-of-sanctuary) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_mindsooth.gif) Improved Concentration Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20256/improved-concentration-aura).  
  
Viable end-game PvE builds are covered in our [Classic Paladin Healer Talents & Builds Guide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/paladin/healer-talent-builds-pve).

Best Professions for Classic Holy Paladins
------------------------------------------

Unlike in other versions of WoW, professions in Classic do not offer any direct combat benefits just for having them. For the most part, you should choose professions that you enjoy, or perhaps even more importantly, will make you gold. Gold is an incredibly important part of Classic due to the many important and expensive purchases that you will need to make, such as epic riding, gear, and consumables such as potions for raiding and PvP. Most professions can help you make gold in some way, but gathering professions such as Mining, Herbalism, and Skinning are always great choices.

### [Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

While most professions do not offer combat benefits, Engineering is the exception. Engineers get access to tons of powerful bombs, tools, and trinkets that can be incredibly strong, especially in PvP. Trinkets such as [![Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_04.gif) Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18638/hyper-radiant-flame-reflector), [![Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_02.gif) Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18634/gyrofreeze-ice-reflector), and [![Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_16.gif) Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18639/ultra-flash-shadow-reflector) allow you to reflect spells of a specific type when used, which can easily change the outcome of a fight. Grenades such as [![Iron Grenade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_08.gif) Iron Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4390/iron-grenade) are critical for stunning a target from range, letting you interrupt a cast or run away in a bad situation. There are also tons of miscellaneous items and pieces of gear like [![Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_49.gif) Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10588/goblin-rocket-helmet), which have different special effects and uses in PvP situations. Engineering is one of the most popular professions in Classic, and for a good reason. If you plan to PvP or raid anything more than casually, Engineering is almost a requirement due to the strength of the consumables that it brings.
