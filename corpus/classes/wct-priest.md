Priests in WoW Classic are masters of light and shadow, offering the strongest healing capabilities in the game as well as a viable damage specialization. They also bring plenty of useful utility in the form of dispels, buffs, and crowd control. Priest healers are always in demand in group content of any kind, and most raids will want to bring at least one Shadow Priest, especially if they have Warlocks in the group who can benefit from [Shadow Weaving](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/15257).

While Priests are considered one of the weakest classes for solo play, they bring an exceptional healing toolkit, with the most varied and powerful healing spells in the game. On the Horde side, they are the only class who can [Dispel Magic](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/527), and one of only two classes on each faction who can use [Resurrection](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2010). They tend to be very busy in group content healing, buffing, dispelling, and resurrecting other characters. They also have some fun niche abilities such as [Mind Vision](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2096), [Levitate](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1706), [Mind Control](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/605), and [Mind Soothe](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/453) that can be extremely valuable in certain situations.

Roles and Specializations
-------------------------

The three talent trees for Priests are **Discipline**, **Holy**, and **Shadow**.

* **Discipline**
  + Focuses on utility talents and buffs.
  + Discipline is a little weaker as a healer than Holy, but offers the [Divine Spirit](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/14752) and [Power Infusion](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/10060) buffs, which may be more useful than added healing, depending on the content and your group.
* **Holy**
  + Offers primarily healing talents.
  + The strongest healing specialization in the game and always in demand for group content.
* **Shadow**
  + Contains talents that improve your damage with shadow spells.
  + Deals less damage than pure damage dealing classes, but still sometimes brought to raids for [Shadow Weaving](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/15257) as well as its utility and passive healing capabilities.

Class Feature: Unique Racial Abilities
--------------------------------------

Priests are the only class who get special racial abilities based on their race. This makes your choice of race much more significant as a Priest.

On the Alliance side, Dwarves are considered the essential race for Priests due to their extremely useful [Fear Ward](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/6346) ability. Horde have a little more flexibility to choose, however.

Resources
---------

Priests use **Mana** as their main ability resource.

Races
-----

Priests have a couple of [Race](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/race/) options for each faction. Priests are unique in that they also obtain special priest abilities based on their race, which are marked with an asterisk (\*) below.

#### Luxrah

I've been playing World of Warcraft on and off since vanilla, usually as a healer or caster and often as a guild leader. I play both retail and classic. I also love RPGs, sandboxes, and sims.
