In Classic WoW, having a good ammo bag and quality ammunition is important for every Hunter. Ammo bags not only store large amounts of ammunition but also provide an addition to ranged attack speed when equipped. Using higher level ammunition is also beneficial, and the best options will improve your performance in PvP and PvE.

How Do Ammo Bags Work?
----------------------

Ammo bags are used to store and manage ammunition for Hunters. When a stack of ammo runs out, the bag automatically reloads the next stack of the same type so that you do not have to manually equip a new stack.

If you have different types of ammo in your bag, for example [Thorium Headed Arrow](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18042) and [Jagged Arrow](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/11285), you can switch between them by right-clicking the stack you want to equip. Hunters often do this to save higher value arrows for more important tasks while using cheaper options elsewhere.

When you purchase or craft ammunition, it will prioritize filling the slots in an equipped ammo bag before filling general bags. Ammunition stacks in groups of 200, so even the smallest ammo bag available can hold up to 1200 arrows or bullets.

Ammo bags also display the number of remaining shots on your action bar. If the total number of shots is less than 1000, the exact number is shown. For counts of 1000 or more, the display shows a “\*” instead.

It should be noted that the ranged attack speed bonus from ammo bags does not stack! If you decide to equip multiple ammo bags (which is not recommended, as you should only equip one), only the bonus from the best ammo bag will apply to your ranged attack speed.

Ammunition
----------

Ammunition includes arrows for bows and crossbows, and bullets for guns. Lower quality ammunition is typically cheaper and more suited for questing and farming. These can be purchased from vendors in major cities and across leveling zones.

![wow classic vendor with arrows](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Vendor-with-Arrows.jpg)

Higher quality ammunition, however, tend to require more effort to obtain, and may involve farming reputation, crafting through a profession, or looting from specific bosses.

### Arrows

For bow and crossbow users, the best arrows offer the highest bonuses to damage. An example shown below is [Doomshot](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12654):

![wow classic doomshot info](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/wow-classic-doomshot-info.jpg)

Doomshot provides the highest damage bonus in the game for arrow users but is considerably rare and difficult to obtain.

### Bullets

There are high damage bullets available for gun users but these are less commonly used due to Hunter itemization favoring bows and crossbows.

![wow classic miniature cannon balls info](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/wow-classic-miniature-cannon-balls-info.jpg)

[Miniature Cannon Balls](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13377) drop from [Cannon Master Wiley](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/stratholme-living/cannon-master-willey) in [Stratholme (Living)](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/stratholme-living) and boast the highest damage addition for any ammunition in the game.

Ammo Bags
---------

### Quivers

Quivers are ammo bags that are used to store arrows. The higher the quiver’s level, the more arrows it can hold, and the greater the ranged attack speed bonus.

Below is a list of all available quivers in Classic.

So What Should I Choose?
------------------------

Hunters throughout Classic typically rely on bows or crossbows, making a higher level quiver more worthwhile to farm. Some Hunters may choose to use guns instead, and will need to obtain a good quality ammo pouch. The best ammo bags and ammunition often require spending considerable money or effort to acquire.

### Quivers

#### [Ancient Sinew Wrapped Lamina](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18714)

This is the best quiver in the game and the only ammo bag that has 18 slots, as all others have 16 or fewer, and it provides a 15% bonus to ranged attack speed. To obtain the Lamina, you will need to obtain two items:

* [Mature Black Dragon Sinew](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18705) – a world drop item with an extremely low drop rate. This item, however, can be bought from the auction house but is usually very expensive.
* [Ancient Petrified Leaf](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18703) – drops from **Majordomo Executus** in **The Molten Core** and starts the epic Hunter quest line.

Upon completing the initial quest from the Ancient Petrified Leaf, you will get the option to complete **Ancient Sinew Wrapped Lamina** which will reward you with this quiver.

#### [Harpy Hide Quiver](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19319)

This is the second best option for quiver users. Like the Lamina, it bears a 15% bonus to ranged attack speed but contains 16 ammunition slots instead of 18. To obtain it, you need to reach Revered with your faction in Alterac Valley. Once Revered, you can purchase this quiver from your respective faction vendor:

* ![Wow Alliance Crest](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Alliance-Crest.png) Alliance: **Thanthaldis Snowgleam** (Alterac Valley) / **Gaelden Hammersmith** (Alterac Mountains)
* ![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Horde-Crest.png) Horde: **Gruunda Wolfheart** (Alterac Valley) / **Jekyll Flandring** (Alterac Mountains)

### Ammo Pouches

#### [Gnoll Skin Bandolier](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19320)

This is the best option in the game for gun users. It holds 16 ammunition slots and a 15% bonus to ranged attack speed.  
Like the Harpy Hide Quiver, this can be purchased from your respective Alterac Valley vendor after raising your reputation to Revered.

### Arrows

#### [Doomshot](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12654)

Doomshot has the highest addition to DPS in the game for arrow users (+20.0). These drop in quantities between 50-200 from [Shadow Hunter Vosh’gajin](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/lower-blackrock-spire/shadow-hunter-voshgajin) in [Lower Blackrock Spire](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/lower-blackrock-spire) and have a 28% drop chance.

The top Hunters usually farm and save these for specific situations, such as fights in PvP or raid boss encounters.

#### [Thorium Headed Arrow](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18042)

Almost every Hunter uses Thorium Headed Arrows, as they are the second best option (+17.5) and easier to obtain than Doomshot. Hunters can get these by turning in 200x [Thorium Shells](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/15997) (which are crafted by Engineers) to their faction specific quest giver:

* ![Wow Alliance Crest](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Alliance-Crest.png) Alliance: **Arrows Are For Sissies** in **Ironforge**
* ![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WoW-Horde-Crest.png) Horde: **A Fair Trade** in **Orgrimmar**

These arrows are also tradable, which allows players to buy them from the Auction House instead of crafting the required Thorium Shells.

#### [Ice Threaded Arrow](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19316)

These arrows provide a +16.5 damage bonus and are a cheaper alternative to Thorium Headed Arrows. They can be purchased in stacks of 200 from the Alterac Valley vendor after reaching Honored with your respective faction.

### Bullets

#### [Miniature Cannon Balls](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13377)

This is the ammunition with the highest damage in the game (+20.5) and they drop from [Cannon Master Wiley](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/stratholme-living/cannon-master-willey) in [Stratholme (Living)](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/stratholme-living). Due to itemization, however, most Hunters will end up using bows and crossbows over guns, meaning these are not as popular as the best arrows.

#### [Rockshard Pellets](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/11630)

Just like Miniature Cannon Balls, these bullets (+18.0) can only be obtained as an item drop. They can be looted from [Lord Roccor](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/blackrock-depths/lord-roccor) in [Blackrock Depths](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/blackrock-depths).

#### [Thorium Shells](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/15997)

Thorium Shells (+17.5) are the easiest option to obtain for gun users. These can either be crafted with [Engineering](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/engineering-1-300/) or bought directly from the Auction House.
