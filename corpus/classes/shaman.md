Enter the Shaman: the Horde-specific class opposite the Alliance-specific Paladin. Commune with the elemental spirits and wield the four elements of nature — fire, earth, air, water — through placed totems. A hybrid class, Shamans can dish out huge AoE healing through chain healing; meteoric, elemental nukes like chain lightning; and big bonks through two-handed Windfury procs. Metaphorically, Shamans are the toolbox’s toolbox; there really is a totem for everything. Shaman players are resilient and creative in their playstyle, and fit in as a support element to any team. They don’t output the biggest damage, and not always the biggest heals, but their totems are a must-have in every raid group, and raids usually bring a shaman for each 5-man grouping.

Roles and Specializations
-------------------------

There are three talent trees for Shaman: **Elemental**, **Enhancement** and **Restoration**.

* **Elemental**
  + Focuses on spellcasting elemental spells like Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning and various Shock spells like Frost Shock.
  + Elemental Shamans are not particularly in demand as damage dealers, but they can usually find a spot just for the totems they bring.
* **Enhancement**
  + Focuses on, well, “big bonks” with various weapon enchantments like Windfury Weapon in melee combat.
  + While not the strongest damage dealers, Enhancement Shamans are often desirable in raids for the buffs they give to other melee classes.
* **Restoration**
  + Focuses on healing, generally raid healing.
  + Shaman healers are often in high demand for their totems and solid AoE healing capabilities.

View the complete Shaman talent tree in our [Shaman Talent Calculator](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/tools/talent-calculator/shaman/).

Class Feature: Totems
---------------------

Totems are the signature characteristic of Shamans, and the primary reason you want one in every group. Their buffs are static and affect members of your *party* in an area of effect around the totem. Most 40-man raid groups bring a Shaman for each group because their totems are so invaluable.

Before you can start dropping totems, you’ll need to acquire four permanent reagents, one matching each totem type: fire, water, air, earth. You collect them throughout leveling: [Earth Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/5175) at level 4, [Fire Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/5176) at 10, [Water Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/5177) at 20 and [Air Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/5178) at 30. Each type of totem has a theme and a number of different castables for each. Only one of each type of totem can be placed at once, e.g., you can’t have [Grace of Air Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8835) and [Windfury Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8512) at the same time. Casting a totem of the same type to one already present will cause the previously cast totem to disappear.

Some of the unique and vital-to-raid totems are listed below:

* [Windfury Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8512): This totem is the reason there are spots for Enhancement shamans in raids. Generally, you *need* Windfury in each melee group for them to parse well, so you’re absolutely bringing one Enhancement for each of your melee groups. This totem gives your main-hand weapons a 20% chance of granting an extra attack with extra melee attack power. Needless to say, Warrior players will be screaming at you to drop this in your dreams.
* [Tremor Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8143): An AoE fear dispel that is applied every few seconds on a tick-based system; the only tool like it for the Horde.
* [[Mana Spring Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5675)](http://Mana Spring Totem) and [Mana Tide Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/16190): [Mana Spring Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5675) is available to all Shaman specs, but [Mana Tide Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/16190) is available only to Restoration Shamans. These two totems are the most effective group-wide mana regenerating spells for Horde.
* [Earthbind Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2484): A 50% AoE slow is ridiculous, especially when you can place it out of LOS and slow an entire group of mobs to a crawl. Don’t underestimate this in raid scenarios either; there’re plenty of mobs which aren’t slow immune.
* [Poison Cleansing Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8166) & [Disease Cleansing Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8170): The great thing about these totems is that you can place them down and cast your single-target dispel at the same time, really piling on the dispels. Fights like Viscidus rely heavily on these totems because of mass poison dispel.
* [Strength of Earth Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8160): This is the butter to [Windfury Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8512)‘s bread. Adds strength to all members within a party, which means more attack power.

#### About the Author

![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/tml-avatars/whatsupdoc.png)

#### Strong

Thrall is the best Warcraft character; tell me I'm wrong. Long-time Blizzard fan who thinks that gnomes are the worst type of people and rogues don't tip (except into your spine). Flying mounts should never have been added to the game, and playing 12 hours of WoW a day just makes you "dedicated."
