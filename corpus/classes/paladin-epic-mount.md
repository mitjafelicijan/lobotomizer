Paladins are one of two classes that get unique [mounts](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/mounts/) specifically for their class, the other being [Warlocks](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/warlock-epic-mount-quest/). Both classes get a basic mount at level 40 and an epic version at level 60. Your level 40 mount as a Paladin is *free*, and your level 60 mount comes at a steep discount. These mounts are also summoned via spells, which saves you a bag slot!

Your first mount is acquired via a simple quest from your class trainer. Later on you’ll need at least 350 gold and the help of allies to successfully acquire your epic mount. The mounts are well worth the effort for the style points since nobody other than a Paladin can ride one!

Note that the level 60 mount cannot be obtained until [Phase 2](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/content-phases/), when the [Dire Maul West](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/dire-maul-west/) dungeon is added to the game.

Paladin Warhorse Mount (Level 40)
---------------------------------

To get your first mount at level 40, seek out one of the following Paladin trainers:

* [Brandur Ironhammer](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/5149) inside the Hall of Mysteries at the Mystic Ward in Ironforge
* [Arthur the Faithful](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/5491) inside the Cathedral of Light at Cathedral Square in Stormwind

They offer the quest [The Tome of Nobility](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/4486). This will task you with seeking out [Duthorian Rall](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/6171) in Stormwind. Once you find him, all you have to do is turn in the quest, pick up the next part of [The Tome of Nobility](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/1661), and that’s it! You now have your [Summon Warhorse](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/13819) spell. As a bonus, learning this spell also teaches you the Riding skill. Where other classes must pay 80-100 gold for their first mount and Riding skill, you get the whole package for free!

Paladin Charger Mount (Level 60)
--------------------------------

This is going to be a bit more challenging! You’ll to invest both time and money to get this awesome mount, although you will save a lot of gold compared to buying a standard epic mount. Let’s first go over what you’ll actually need to complete the quest chain.

### FAQ

**Where can I start the quests?**

The questline begins with [Duthorian Rall](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/6171), found within the Cathedral of Light in Stormwind City.

**Can I solo the questline?**

No, you will need a group for Dire Maul, Scholomance, and Stratholme if you don’t already have the [Stratholme Holy Water](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/13180).

**Do I need to learn riding skills?**

No, both the level 40 and 60 mount quests give you the necessary skills to ride them.

**Is there any way to bypass the gold requirements?**

You can collect all necessary mats if you have [Mining](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/mining-1-300/) and [Herbalism](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/herbalism-1-300/), but you’ll still need to find someone with [Alchemy](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/alchemy-1-to-300/) to transmute the bars. The combined 350 gold requirement of [Emphasis on Sacrifice](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/7637), [Collection of Goods](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/7642), and [Ancient Equine Spirit](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/7643) *cannot* be skipped.

**Can I fight Death Knight Darkreaver again after the final quest?**

Yes, you’ll need to pick up another [Divination Scryer](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/18746) from Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker in the SWC Cathedral. He will offer you the instantly completable quest [Again Into the Great Ossuary](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/7666).

### Advice

* Try to collect all of the necessary materials *before* starting the quest chain to save you time. You can stash them in the bank and pull them out just before you need them as you’ll already be near a bank. (We’ll mention when to pull your items out before leaving a convenient location).
* Make sure to use the correct judgment spells when fighting the waves leading up to Death Knight Darkreaver! They do significant damage and AoE stun all enemies in range.
* Take a strong and competent group with you when you run Dire Maul, Scholomance, and Stratholme for the holy water. Make sure they’re on the same page as you and that they’re ready to stop at the appropriate locations to help/allow you to do your quests.
* Make sure to have a Rogue with you when you do Dire Maul and Scholomance. This will eliminate your need for specific keys. Otherwise, you’ll need to clear other parts of the dungeon to get the keys that allow you access to the specific parts of the dungeon you need to be in.

### Quest Walkthroughs

Without further ado, we’ll start on the quest walkthroughs. There are several quests to do in the questline, so we’ve split it up into four easily digestible sections. Make sure to fully read through them beforehand so you’re well prepared and have any necessary mats taken out of the bank.

If I'm not working or spending time with the family I'm probably gaming. Some of my favorite recent games I've played are Far Cry 5, World of Warcraft Classic, and 7 Days to Die.
