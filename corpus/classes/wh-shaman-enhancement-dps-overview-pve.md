*Shamans are the spiritual advisors of the Horde. The shaman is a versatile and flexible class that fulfills many roles in an adventuring party. While other classes are pure fighters or spellcasters, the shaman enjoys a happy medium in-between. The shaman is an effective spellcaster, but can also fight extremely well with mace and staff.* - World of Warcraft Game Manual, 2004

|  | Shamans in WoW Classic are all about Totems. A Totem is a stationary, generally one-shottable due to very low health, independent object in the game world, which is placed by the shaman in exchange for Mana and a global cooldown. There are many Totems available to Shamans, and each has a unique, often niche, ability. You can have one Totem of each element placed at once - Water (such as  [Healing Stream Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10463/healing-stream-totem)), Earth (such as  [Strength of Earth Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25361/strength-of-earth-totem)), Air (such as  [Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10614/windfury-totem)) and Fire (such as  [Searing Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10438/searing-totem)). Besides Totems, Enhancement [Shaman Shaman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=7/shaman) have some of the largest burst damage potential in the game when combining  [Stormstrike](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17364/stormstrike) with  [Windfury Weapon](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16362/windfury-weapon) procs and  [Earth Shock](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10414/earth-shock) as a followup that hits the target at the same time, and can also single target heal when needed with  [Lesser Healing Wave](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10468/lesser-healing-wave), making them very flexible. |

Viability of DPS Enhancement Shaman in WoW Classic PvE Content
--------------------------------------------------------------

[![Shaman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_shaman.gif) Shaman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=7/shaman) is Horde's best support buddy in PvE, bringing everything from healing to massive damage increases. Even if you are not focusing on the more common healing role, encounters outside raiding are short enough that your damage will be great and you can still be a valuable raid member for a guild who wants your Totems but does not want to run 8 Restoration Shamans, which is a likely scenario.  
  
The real value of Shaman isn't in their own damage, but in the buffs they bring - most notably [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10613/windfury-totem), which has an *incredible* impact on Warrior damage. Due to exactly how powerful that buff is, many raiding Shaman lean toward Enhancement in order to talent into [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_enchantweapon.gif) Improved Weapon Totems](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=29193/improved-weapon-totems) to increase their buffs further, though they have a fairly stale rotation made up of only two long cooldown abilities, so they spend most of their time alternating Windfury and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_invisibilitytotem.gif) Grace of Air Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25359/grace-of-air-totem) to maximize buff potential.   
  
Windfury aside, Shaman bring several other useful totems including [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_tremortotem.gif) Tremor Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=8143/tremor-totem) and spell resistances, which can be very important in Molten Core.

Strengths of DPS Enhancement Shaman
-----------------------------------

#### * (Extra) Unrivaled support class for Horde

Shamans are one of the most desired party members in WoW Classic, as they bring strong burst damage ([![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofmight.gif) Stormstrike](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17364/stormstrike), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_cyclone.gif) Windfury Weapon](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16362/windfury-weapon) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_earthshock.gif) Earth Shock](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10414/earth-shock)), healing ([![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_healingwavelesser.gif) Lesser Healing Wave](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10468/lesser-healing-wave)), **vastly increased damage** for all kinds of groups ([![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_brilliance.gif) Tranquil Air Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25908/tranquil-air-totem), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10614/windfury-totem) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_earthbindtotem.gif) Strength of Earth Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25361/strength-of-earth-totem)) and unrivaled utility for the group ([![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_tremortotem.gif) Tremor Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=8143/tremor-totem), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_poisoncleansingtotem.gif) Poison Cleansing Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=8166/poison-cleansing-totem) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fireresistancetotem_01.gif) Fire Resistance Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10538/fire-resistance-totem)). Take note that Enhancement [![Shaman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_shaman.gif) Shaman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=7/shaman) support Totems are the strongest of all, as they benefit from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_earthbindtotem.gif) Enhancing Totems](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16295/enhancing-totems) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_enchantweapon.gif) Improved Weapon Totems](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=29192/improved-weapon-totems). Last, but not least, they are the preferred [![Annihilator](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_12.gif) Annihilator](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12798/annihilator) / [![Nightfall](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_12.gif) Nightfall](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19169/nightfall) wielders, as they can still bring full Totemic power to their group, while maintaining great uptime on its buff due to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ghoulfrenzy.gif) Flurry](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16284/flurry).

#### * Top notch burst damage and burst healing

Enhancement Shamans are one of the scariest classes to face in PvP, as they can often drop you straight from 100% to 0% life if they get Windfury procs that critical strike and have [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_earthshock.gif) Earth Shock](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10414/earth-shock) ready. They can also easily save someone from dying through the use of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_ravenform.gif) Nature's Swiftness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16188/natures-swiftness) with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_magicimmunity.gif) Healing Wave](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25357/healing-wave) if you are using the defensive spec.

#### * Best utility in PvP

With quick heals such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_healingwavelesser.gif) Lesser Healing Wave](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10468/lesser-healing-wave), the shortest cooldown ranged interrupt in game, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_earthshock.gif) Earth Shock](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10414/earth-shock), which also deals significant damage, an offensive dispel in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_purge.gif) Purge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=8012/purge), and plenty of PvP-oriented totemic utility in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_strengthofearthtotem02.gif) Earthbind Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2484/earthbind-totem), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_groundingtotem.gif) Grounding Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=8177/grounding-totem) and the ubiquitous [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10614/windfury-totem), a melee player's best friend.

---

Weaknesses of DPS Enhancement Shaman
------------------------------------

#### * Mana Problems

Mana, especially when Totem Twisting, is a problem for Enhancement [![Shaman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_shaman.gif) Shaman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=7/shaman)s in Wow Classic. Swapping totems every 10 seconds costs a lot of Mana, and your regeneration abilities as a Shaman are pathetic since they do not possess talents that allow Mana regeneration to continue during combat. While you can somewhat offset this weakness with Mana consumables and Mana per 5-second gear, it will never stop being a problem whenever fights are long.

#### * Low Sustained Damage

Due to the point above and their lack of strong attack abilities, Shamans have low sustained damage over a long period, especially when compared with classes such as Rogues and Warriors. This forces frequent drinking while leveling or soloing, and heavy Mana consumable usage in raids.

#### * Pressured to focus on Healing

Since healers are few and far between in WoW Classic, and Shaman's great capabilities for healing, you will be asked to heal in most groups you join. Since this is a guide for **Enhancement** Shamans, we would like to advise you to create your own groups and/or show your superior dedication to the guild, by crafting [![Annihilator](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_12.gif) Annihilator](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12798/annihilator) / [![Nightfall](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_12.gif) Nightfall](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19169/nightfall), and thus justifying your spot.

Best Races for PvE WoW Classic DPS Enhancement Shaman
-----------------------------------------------------

Only Horde players can be Shaman in Classic WoW: [![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc), [![Troll](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_troll_male.gif) Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll), [![Tauren](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_tauren_male.gif) Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren).

Shaman are WoW Classic's **Horde** only class, which are the only source of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=27621/windfury-totem), an insanely powerful boost to a Shaman's group damage output. They also possess several other useful Totems and some of the best burst damage in the game, although they need to manage their Mana well for their full potential to be realized over the course of a long fight. They are also the primary [Totem Twisting](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/shaman-totems-classic-wow) specialization, as they are the only ones able to naturally grab several critical Totem talents in their tree: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_earthbindtotem.gif) Enhancing Totems](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16295/enhancing-totems) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_enchantweapon.gif) Improved Weapon Totems](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=29192/improved-weapon-totems).  
  
The best WoW Classic race for Enhancement Shaman is [![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) in both PvE and PvP.

#### [Orc Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) Shaman

Orcs are one of the best PvP Races in the game due to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_23.gif) Hardiness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20573/hardiness), which will cause you to resist enemy crowd control 25% more often for a total of 30% when accounting for the baseline 5% chance to resist stuns. Stun effects include [![Iron Grenade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_08.gif) Iron Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4390/iron-grenade), [![Tidal Charm](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_rune_01.gif) Tidal Charm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=1404/tidal-charm), or the dreaded [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_kidneyshot.gif) Kidney Shot](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=8643/kidney-shot). [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_orc_berserkerstrength.gif) Blood Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20572/blood-fury) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_02.gif) Axe Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20574/axe-specialization) are also amazing for Enhancement, making Orc the default choice for all types of content.

#### Racial Bonuses

#### [Troll Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) Shaman

Trolls are also a good race for PvE. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_troll_berserk.gif) Berserking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20554/berserking), especially if used right after a big area of effect ability from the boss that lowered your health significantly, grants a huge haste increase, which is huge for damage. None of the other racials will have much impact on your performance, but [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_troll_berserk.gif) Berserking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20554/berserking) alone is very nice to have.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pelt_bear_ruin_02.gif) Beast Slaying](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20557/beast-slaying): Damage dealt versus Beasts increased by 5%.

At full health, the speed increase is 10% with a greater effect up to 30% if you are badly hurt when you activate Berserking. Lasts 10 sec.

#### [Tauren Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren) Shaman

Taurens are not the best in either PvP or PvE. But they are a decent option for both, having a little bit of extra health due to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Endurance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20550/endurance). [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warstomp.gif) War Stomp](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20549/war-stomp) is fantastic in PvP, as it allows you the time to cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_healingwavelesser.gif) Lesser Healing Wave](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10468/lesser-healing-wave) uninterrupted, and can also be used to gain time while running away with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritwolf.gif) Ghost Wolf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2645/ghost-wolf), or for letting allies run away. Finally, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_flower_01.gif) Cultivation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20552/cultivation) allows you to level [![Herbalism](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Herbalism](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=182/herbalism) much quicker, which is excellent while leveling!

#### Racial Bonuses

WoW Classic Enhancement Shaman DPS Specializations
--------------------------------------------------

There are three specialization talent trees for Classic Shaman: Enhancement (melee DPS), Elemental (Ranged DPS), and Restoration (Healing).   
  
Classes in Classic WoW will earn a total of 51 talent points, allowing them to take talents from multiple trees, though most builds typically invest the majority of their points in one tree, while taking only select bonuses in the others. As an Enhancement Shaman, you will put the majority of your points into the Enhancement tree, with some support in Restoration or Elemental, depending on the situation.  
  
 **Restoration:** By calling on their spiritual power, shamans can restore health to injured allies.

* [Mana Tide builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/shaman/healer-talent-builds-pve#deep-restoration-caster-maximum-healing) specialize not only in great mana efficiency, but also flexibility with both strong single target and AoE healing. There are a lot of strong talent choices in the Restoration tree, making it quite common to spend the vast majority of talent points there, rather than spreading them across multiple trees.

 **Enhancement:** Shamans enhance their weapons with elemental effects, empowering their blows with the power of fire, wind, or ice.

* [Stormstrike builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/shaman/enhancement/dps-talent-builds-pve#stormstrike-pve) can be incredibly bursty due to chain windfury procs, but are extremely passive, with only two primary abilities in the rotation, both on moderate cooldowns. Because of this, the Shaman is free to focus on maximizing totem buffs with a strategy called [Totem Twisting](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/shaman-totems-classic-wow#advanced-tactics-totem-twisting). Because of their lower personal damage contribution, Enhancement Shaman are typically the go-to specialization for maintaining important raid debuffs such as [![Annihilator](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_12.gif) Annihilator](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12798/annihilator) and [![Nightfall](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_12.gif) Nightfall](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19169/nightfall).

 **Elemental:** The elemental force of the shamans can be used to damage enemies from afar with lightning strikes, earthquakes, and lava bursts.

* [Elemental Mastery builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/shaman/elemental/dps-talent-builds-pve#elemental-mastery-pve) are designed to deal sustained damage, with several defensive talents to help PvE and PvP viability. For pure PvP gameplay, [Nature's Swiftness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/shaman/elemental/dps-talent-builds-pve#natures-swiftness-pvp) enables one of the best hybrid damage and healing Shaman builds.

### Best Builds for Enhancement Shaman

As an Enhancement Shaman, you will put the majority of your points into the Enhancement tree, with some support in Restoration or Elemental, depending on the situation.  
  
Viable end-game PvE builds are covered in our [Classic Enhancement Shaman DPS Talents & Builds Guide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/shaman/enhancement/dps-talent-builds-pve).

Best Professions for Classic DPS Enhancement Shaman
---------------------------------------------------

### [Herbalism](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/herbalism-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Shamans don't have any notable profession-specific gear. As such, it is usually great to go [![Herbalism](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Herbalism](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=182/herbalism) for gold making and independence in your consumable farming (especially where [![Black Lotus](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_herb_blacklotus.gif) Black Lotus](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13468/black-lotus) are concerned!), or [![Alchemy](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Alchemy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=171/alchemy) to gather valuable recipes and create your own consumables.

### [Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Engineering is an absolute must-have if you are trying to go the extra mile in PvE or PvP. In PvE, you should go [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/trade_engineering.gif) Gnomish Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20220/gnomish-engineering), allowing you to craft [![Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_polymorphchicken.gif) Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10725/gnomish-battle-chicken) and [![Arcanite Dragonling](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_head_dragon_01.gif) Arcanite Dragonling](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16022/arcanite-dragonling), bind on pickup trinkets that summon pets that can help your group immensely. The Battle Chicken attacks the nearest target and has a chance on hit to trigger [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_birdbeck_01.gif) Battle Squawk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23060/battle-squawk), which increases the melee attack speed of all party members by 5%, making it great in a melee group. Meanwhile, the Dragonling also attacks the nearest target, stacking [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_fireball.gif) Flame Buffet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9658/flame-buffet) for increased fire damage taken, which is excellent against any enemy vulnerable to fire. Also, in PvE, you will be able to use [![Dense Dynamite](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_06.gif) Dense Dynamite](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18641/dense-dynamite), a bomb that deals ~400 damage, which only has a cooldown of 60 seconds, which can be a significant boost in damage when a whole group is using it.  
  
In PvP, Engineering allows you to do things that you wouldn't normally be allowed to. With [![Iron Grenade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_08.gif) Iron Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4390/iron-grenade) or similar items, a Shaman can gain time to cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_healingwavelesser.gif) Lesser Healing Wave](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10468/lesser-healing-wave) uninterrupted. As another example, [![Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_49.gif) Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10588/goblin-rocket-helmet) can allow you to take an enemy out of the fight for over 10 seconds. Also notable, are the reflector trinkets: [![Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_04.gif) Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18638/hyper-radiant-flame-reflector), [![Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_02.gif) Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18634/gyrofreeze-ice-reflector), and [![Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_16.gif) Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18639/ultra-flash-shadow-reflector). These items allow the Shaman to reflect various spells back at the caster, such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_fireball02.gif) Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18809/pyroblast), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_frostbolt02.gif) Frostbolt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25304/frostbolt), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_deathcoil.gif) Death Coil](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17926/death-coil), gaining more time to do valuable healing. Take note that you will only reflect spells for 5 seconds, and get an obvious effect on you when the trinkets are used. Finally, [![Goblin Sapper Charge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Sapper Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge) can be bought from players who went [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/trade_engineering.gif) Goblin Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20221/goblin-engineering) and deals a massive burst of damage, which can be used to finish players off in PvP, to increase raid DPS in PvE, or in mass area of effect PvP situations where all players use it to wipe an enemy group instantly.
