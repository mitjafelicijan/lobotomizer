The Druid is a versatile hybrid class, capable of filling any role in the game thanks to their powerful shapeshifting abilities. In WoW Classic, they are often considered to be jacks-of-all-trades, masters-of-none, with their flexibility and utility making up for what they may lack in damage, healing, or threat output compared to other classes.

Druids are best known for their unique group utility in the form of [Innervate](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/29166) and [Rebirth](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20748). In PvP, they are the kings of mobility, able to escape roots and slows with their shapeshifting and race ahead of the pack with [Dash](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/23099) and [Travel Form](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/783). Whether you’re looking to powershift your way up the damage meters, keep your party alive with powerful heal-over-time spells, or lift everyone’s spirits as a dancing Boomkin, the nature-loving Druid class has something for everyone.

  + Poor DPS performance in raids.
* **Feral**
  + Contains talents for melee DPS and tanking.
  + Cat DPS is generally mid-tier performance in raids, but great for leveling.
  + Decent tanking for dungeons and raids in Bear form.
* **Restoration**
  + Focused on healing.
  + Strong raid healing performance and great for dungeons.

Class Feature: Shapeshifting
----------------------------

The signature feature of the Druid class is its shapeshifting capability. New forms are learned as you level, unlocking new approaches to combat and travel. Switching forms breaks snares and slows, allowing Druids a great deal of freedom of movement on the battlefield.

* [Bear Form](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5487) is the first form learned at level 10, and is the primary form for [Feral Tanking](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/feral-druid-tank-guide-som/). This form gets beefier at level 40 with [Dire Bear Form](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/9634).
* [Cat Form](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/768) is learned at level 20 and is used for [Feral DPS](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/feral-druid-pve-dps/). This form also allows the use of the [Prowl](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/9913) and [Dash](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/23110) abilities, allowing the Druid to stealth or sprint. If specced into the [Feline Swiftness](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/17002) Feral talent, it also allows faster movement in areas where mounts can’t be used.
* [Moonkin Form](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/24858) is learned through a talent in the Balance tree and is used for [Balance DPS](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/balance-druid-pve-dps/). This form gives [Moonkin Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/24907), a 3% increased spell critical chance to party members within 30 yards.
* [Aquatic Form](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1066) is learned at level 16 and allows the Druid to move very quickly in water. This is an underrated ability for leveling and farming.
* [Travel Form](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/783) is learned at level 30 and increases movement speed on land. This form can only be used outside and is slower than a mount, but it is an instant cast.
* **Tree of Life Form** and **Flight Form** are not added to the game until later expansions.

Resources
---------

Druids use multiple types of ability resources, depending upon their current form.

* **Mana** is used when they are in their normal humanoid form or [Moonkin Form](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/24858).
* **Rage** is used in [Bear Form](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5487) or [Dire Bear Form](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/9634).
* **Energy** is used in [Cat Form](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/768).
* **Combo Points** are also acquired and spent in [Cat Form](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/768).

Races

Druids have only one [Race](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/race/) option for each faction.

#### Luxrah

I've been playing World of Warcraft on and off since vanilla, usually as a healer or caster and often as a guild leader. I play both retail and classic. I also love RPGs, sandboxes, and sims.
