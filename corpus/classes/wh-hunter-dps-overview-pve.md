Viability of Hunters in WoW Classic Fresh PvE Content
-----------------------------------------------------

Because of their lack of raw damage in PvE, [![Hunter](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_hunter.gif) Hunter](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=3/hunter) is not needed as much in raids for pure DPS. They bring excellent utility, but raid groups will often only need 3-5 hunters to perform that. Meaning you might find it harder to get a raid spot but when you do there will be far less competition for gear than other classes.   
  
Classes like [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) and [![Mage](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_mage.gif) Mage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=8/mage) will fill up to potentially 10 spots each in some raid groups. This is because once the mechanics are down, the raid brings the highest damage dealing classes. So basically you will be wanted, but only in lesser numbers than some classes, which has it's good points and bad points.

Strengths of Classic Hunters
----------------------------

#### * Solo farming [Dire Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2557/dire-maul) - North Tribute For Gold

Hunters can solo farm [Dire Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2557/dire-maul) unlike any other class. You can sneak past most mobs and the ones they can't, you can pull, use your pet to distract, run past and reset with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_feigndeath.gif) Feign Death](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=5384/feign-death). This way you can run all the way to the last boss [King Gordok](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11501/king-gordok) without having to fight any trash mobs. Doing this and selling the items or disenchanting them for [![Large Brilliant Shard](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_shardbrilliantlarge.gif) Large Brilliant Shard](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14344/large-brilliant-shard) provides some good gold per hour.

#### * Utility

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_drowsy.gif) Tranquilizing Shot](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19801/tranquilizing-shot) is a spell you will learn from [![Tome of Tranquilizing Shot](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_book_11.gif) Tome of Tranquilizing Shot](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16665/tome-of-tranquilizing-shot) which drops from [Lucifron](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12118/lucifron) in [Molten Core](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2717/molten-core). This will allow you to remove the buff [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_challangingroar.gif) Frenzy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19451/frenzy) off certain mobs such as [Magmadar](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11982/magmadar) in [Molten Core](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2717/molten-core). There are bosses and mobs throughout the game that will require you to be there to use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_drowsy.gif) Tranquilizing Shot](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19801/tranquilizing-shot) on and weaken it.  
  
[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_arcane_blink.gif) Distracting Shot](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20736/distracting-shot) is a ranged taunt that will cause the target to switch to you immediately. You will use this to kite certain mobs around on some fights for your group. It can be used to pull aggro off a healer, and if quick enough have your pet taunt it off you. There are a lot of situational uses for this spell that your group will enjoy having you use it.

#### * Unique Pets

Having the option to tame pets that will help you in all situations is quite a strong perk. Whether you grab something tanky to help you kill that big elite by yourself, or maybe you find a pet with spell damage abilities, helping you bypass [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) armor. There are numerous pets you will use for certain situations.  
  
Learn more in our [Classic Hunter Pet Guide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classic-wow-hunter-pets).

#### * Excel in 1v1 combat

Hunters generally can win most 1v1s verses a similarly skilled player, and even players that may be of a higher skill. Hunters have an abundance of CC and utility plus a pet that will constantly deal damage as long as it can stick to a target. As long as you can learn how to kite, most classes won't be able to beat you very easily in a 1v1. They remain fairly strong for PvP throughout the game.

---

Weaknesses of Classic Hunters
-----------------------------

#### * Dead zone

The dead zone is the distance in which a player has very little or even no options for action against a hostile target. It is in between 5 yards and 8 yards. At 5 yards and less a player can attack with and use melee abilities. At 8 yards or more a player can fire a ranged weapon. Hunters also can't move and shoot at the same time in Classic meaning you can't just move back and shoot. Classes like [![Mage](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_mage.gif) Mage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=8/mage) can keep you slowed and stay in this dead zone forcing you only to melee or not attack at all. Unfortunately, there are sometimes limited options to get out of the dead zone.

#### * Damage isn't the best

You are required for certain mechanics and provide decent DPS, but generally, only a few hunters will make up your 40 man group, since you only need a few at most for the mechanics and then other DPS do more. This DPS gap only gets larger as patches go on. You can mitigate this gap in dps with other classes however by learning to melee weave. This is an engaging and rewarding playstyle that can increase your dps a significant amount when done properly.

#### * Micro Management

There are a few things that you will always have to make sure you have on you as a [![Hunter](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_hunter.gif) Hunter](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=3/hunter). If you are ever out in the world, or even worse in a dungeon, raid or PvP instance and find yourself out of ammo, you could be in trouble. A Hunter without ammo is a [![Rogue](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_rogue.gif) Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue) without daggers. A lot of your abilities will be unavailable to use, and your DPS will be extremely lower. You will have to travel back to a city or town and purchase some ammo, or you will be a big hindrance.  
  
You also have to take care of your pet; you will need to feed it and make sure that it is happy, so that is performing the best damage it can. You need to get the right type of food for it, and if you don't feed it enough, it will be weak and even run away. A happy, well-fed pet is a strong pet. On top of keeping your pet fed fully, you will want to keep up the micromanagement to ensure your pet does not die to any mechanics which will result in a dps loss having to spend time resurrecting's your pet which will also take away a large portion of your mana.

Best Races for PvE WoW Classic Hunters
--------------------------------------

Five races can be Hunters in WoW Classic: [![Dwarf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_dwarf_male.gif) Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) and [![Night Elf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_nightelf_male.gif) Night Elf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=4/night-elf) for the Alliance, and [![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc), [![Tauren](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_tauren_male.gif) Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren), and [![Troll](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_troll_male.gif) Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) for the Horde.

| [Undead Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Best Race for Alliance Hunters

Alliance [![Hunter](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_hunter.gif) Hunter](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=3/hunter) have the benefit of Raiding with a Paladin, which can Buff the Hunter with powerful Blessings such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_fistofjustice.gif) Blessing of Might](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25291/blessing-of-might) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_magearmor.gif) Blessing of Kings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20217/blessing-of-kings). A Paladin also uses various Auras, giving a buff to all party members, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_devotionaura.gif) Devotion Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10293/devotion-aura), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_sealoffire.gif) Fire Resistance Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19900/fire-resistance-aura), but the Paladin might also be using [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_mindsooth.gif) Concentration Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19746/concentration-aura), which doesn't benefit the Hunter. Deciding a race for Hunter on Alliance is almost purely cosmetic. You will likely choose a race based on the personal preference of their aesthetics.  
  
Both [![Dwarf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_dwarf_male.gif) Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) and [![Night Elf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_nightelf_male.gif) Night Elf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=4/night-elf) do not provide strong WoW Classic PvE benefits--choose whichever you like.

#### [Dwarf Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) Hunter

Dwarves lack any racial abilities for PvE Hunters. Their Racial mostly helps against [![Rogue](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_rogue.gif) Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue)s, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform) will allow you to remove all poison effects on you, but more importantly, it allows the Dwarf to break out of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_mindsteal.gif) Blind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2094/blind), even while Blinded! [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform) has other uses as well, allowing the Dwarf to remove a [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) Bleeds, or even an [![Undead](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_scourge_male.gif) Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead)Â [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) Class Racial, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_blackplague.gif) Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19280/devouring-plague)! You may think [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_musket_03.gif) Gun Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20595/gun-specialization) would be good considering how important weapon skills are but unfortunately at no point is a gun ever a BiS item for Hunters, so as for PvE Raiding Dwarf has no benefits.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_dwarf_findtreasure.gif) Find Treasure](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2481/find-treasure): Allows the dwarf to sense nearby treasure, making it appear on the minimap. Lasts until cancelled.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_wizardmark.gif) Frost Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20596/frost-resistance): Frost resistance increased by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_musket_03.gif) Gun Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20595/gun-specialization): Guns skill increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform): While active, grants immunity to Bleed, Poison, and Disease effects. In addition, Armor increased by 10%. Lasts 8 sec.

#### [Night Elf Night Elf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=4/night-elf) Hunter

Night Elf has nearly no benefits for a PVE hunter either. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Shadowmeld](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20580/shadowmeld) is an entertaining spell for PVP and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_shadowmeld.gif) Quickness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20582/quickness) is also useful for PvP. But as for PvE benefits, you start with 9 more agility than other races, so it is a pretty much unnoticeable damage increase. So as for Night Elves, they don't have any racials that will affect raiding either.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritarmor.gif) Nature Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20583/nature-resistance): Nature Resistance increased by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Wisp Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20585/wisp-spirit): Transform into a wisp upon death, increasing movement speed by 50%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_shadowmeld.gif) Quickness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20582/quickness): Dodge chance increased by 1%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Shadowmeld](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20580/shadowmeld): Activate to slip into the shadows, reducing the chance for enemies to detect your presence. Lasts until canceled or upon moving. Night Elf Rogues and Druids with Shadowmeld are more difficult to detect while stealthed or prowling.

---

### Best Race for Horde Hunters

[![Troll](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_troll_male.gif) Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) is the best Classic WoW Horde Hunter race for PvE, while [![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) or [![Tauren](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_tauren_male.gif) Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren) is the best Classic WoW Horde Hunter race for PvP.  
  
Horde [![Hunter](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_hunter.gif) Hunter](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=3/hunter) will unfortunately not benefit as much from their faction's unique class Shaman. While Alliance Hunters will be able to receive buffs from a Paladin, the perhaps most useful thing Shamans can do to buff dps is [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=27621/windfury-totem). While this is extremely useful to melee DPS types the hunter won't receive much from this. But unlike Alliance, the Horde racials for hunters are a lot stronger for DPS and I would even argue PvP.

#### [Orc Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) Hunter

Orcs are the absolute best PvP Race in the game, period. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_23.gif) Hardiness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20573/hardiness) is so powerful, Blizzard had no choice but to nerf it a total of **three** times, leading up to Warlords of Draenor. Now that Classic is releasing, the true power of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_23.gif) Hardiness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20573/hardiness) will be realized once again. Every character in World of Warcraft has a base 5% chance to resist a Stun effect. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_23.gif) Hardiness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20573/hardiness) increases your Stun resist chance, effectively giving the Orc a 30% chance to Resist incoming Stuns. Things like [![Iron Grenade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_08.gif) Iron Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4390/iron-grenade), [![Tidal Charm](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_rune_01.gif) Tidal Charm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=1404/tidal-charm), or even an enemy Rogue's [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_kidneyshot.gif) Kidney Shot](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=8643/kidney-shot), all can be resisted. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_warcry.gif) Command](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20575/command) is a flat 5% damage increase for your pet so is a plus for both PvE and PvP. As for [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_orc_berserkerstrength.gif) Blood Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20572/blood-fury), it only buffs melee attack power, so it isn't beneficial.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_02.gif) Axe Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20574/axe-specialization): Skill with Axes and Two-Handed Axes increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_warcry.gif) Command](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20575/command): Damage dealt by Hunter and Warlock pets increased by 5%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_23.gif) Hardiness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20573/hardiness): Chance to resist Stun effects increased by an additional 25%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_orc_berserkerstrength.gif) Blood Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20572/blood-fury): Increases base melee attack power by 25% for 15 sec and reduces healing effects on you by 50% for 25 sec.

#### [Tauren Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren) Hunter

Tauren Hunters lack any racials that make them the best choice for PvE. But that being said having that little bit of extra health with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Endurance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20550/endurance) can be useful in rare circumstances, it may just be that little bit of extra health you needed to survive! Also, the use of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warstomp.gif) War Stomp](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20549/war-stomp) in PvP can be useful to peel for other players or yourself. It will also give you a 2-second window to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_feigndeath.gif) Feign Death](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=5384/feign-death) and place a [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_chainsofice.gif) Freezing Trap](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1499/freezing-trap) on your target. Since you can't place traps in combat in Classic, this is very useful. It also allows you to save your [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_golemstormbolt.gif) Scatter Shot](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19503/scatter-shot) which is usually what hunters will use before feign/trapping.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_flower_01.gif) Cultivation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20552/cultivation): Herbalism skill increased by 15.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Endurance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20550/endurance): Total Health increased by 5%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritarmor.gif) Nature Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20551/nature-resistance): Nature Resistance increased by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warstomp.gif) War Stomp](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20549/war-stomp): Stuns up to 5 enemies within 8 yds for 2 sec.

#### [Troll Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) Hunter

Trolls are the best race for hunters in PvE overall. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_bow_12.gif) Bow Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=26290/bow-specialization) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_troll_berserk.gif) Berserking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20554/berserking) give you a significantly higher output than Hunters of other races. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_regenerate.gif) Regeneration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20555/regeneration) is also useful while leveling and generally grinding, it will also help healers slightly in raids making them have to heal you a tiny bit less than others. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pelt_bear_ruin_02.gif) Beast Slaying](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20557/beast-slaying) is useful for leveling mainly, while killing mobs but has several uses in raids where beasts are present like MC's [Magmadar](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11982/magmadar). Trolls don't have any racials that make them stand out in PvP, but the overall higher damage output will still have them be useful.

#### Racial Bonuses

WoW Classic Hunter DPS Specializations
--------------------------------------

There are three specialization talent trees for Hunters: Beast Mastery, Marksmanship, and Survival. Hunters frequently invest half or more of their points into Marksmanship though several viable talent combinations still exist, depending on whether the player is interested in PvE or PvP.   
  
Â **Beast Mastery:** A master of the wild who can tame a wide variety of beasts to assist them in combat.

* [Beast Mastery/Marksmanship builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/hunter/dps-talent-builds-pve#bm-mm) provide excellent top end damage by emphasizing both pet damage and the Hunter's own ranged attakcs, though falls off if the pet is unable to attack. A [similar hybrid build](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/hunter/dps-talent-builds-pve#intimidation-scatter-shot) exists for PvP which rewards proper pet management in conjunction with kiting tools to keep the player out of harm's way.

Â **Marksmanship:** A master archer or sharpshooter who excels in bringing down enemies from afar.

* [Trueshot Aura builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/hunter/dps-talent-builds-pve#mm-sv) are the heart of most Hunter builds in WoW Classic, as the tree provides a number of bonuses useful in all situations, including increased range, damage, reduced mana costs, and a group-wide buff.

 **Survival:** A rugger tracker who favors using animal venom, explosives and traps as deadly weapons.

* The [Lightning Reflexes build](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/hunter/dps-talent-builds-pve#lightning-reflexes-scatter-shot) is a solid PvP build, especially for higher geared players in later phases of the game, offering strong burst damage, crowd control, and survivability in melee.

### Best Hunter Spec for PvE in WoW Classic

The best Hunter spec for early PvE is Marksmanship. With a MM/SV 2/31/18 Talent Build build, you deal solid DPS and provide your party with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_trueshot.gif) Trueshot Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19506/trueshot-aura).   
  
Viable end-game PvE builds are covered in our [Classic Hunter DPS Talents & Builds Guide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/hunter/dps-talent-builds-pve).

Best Professions for Classic Hunters
------------------------------------

Though Hunters generally aren't required to have professions to raid, some guilds will want you to have them. They will help with crafting gear, gold making, PvP, and some extra damage.

### [Skinning](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/skinning-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Many Hunters will skill into [![Skinning](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Skinning](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=393/skinning), as Hunters are great at soloing difficult monsters that drop expensive skinning materials. Examples of these materials include [![Devilsaur Leather](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pelt_03.gif) Devilsaur Leather](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=15417/devilsaur-leather) Leather and [![Black Dragonscale](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_monsterscales_07.gif) Black Dragonscale](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=15416/black-dragonscale). As well as making gold from these materials they can also be used to craft some great early game armor for Hunters. Primarily the [Devilsaur Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=143/devilsaur-armor) set. [![Leatherworking](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/trade_leatherworking.gif) Leatherworking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=165/leatherworking) compliments [![Skinning](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Skinning](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=393/skinning) well but [![Engineering](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=202/engineering) will always have that aspect of bringing that little bit of extra damage.

### [Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Engineering is an absolute must-have if you are trying to go the extra mile in PvE or PvP. In PvE, you will be able to use [![Dense Dynamite](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_06.gif) Dense Dynamite](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18641/dense-dynamite), a bomb that deals ~400 damage, which only has a cooldown of 60 seconds, which can be a significant boost in damage. You can also use [![Goblin Sapper Charge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Sapper Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge) at times especially if you melee weave and are going in close to a pack of mobs.   
  
In PvP, Engineering is just as useful. With an [![Iron Grenade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_08.gif) Iron Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4390/iron-grenade), a Hunter can gain more distance from a target or line up a big [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_spear_07.gif) Aimed Shot](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19434/aimed-shot). There is also the super-powerful [![Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_49.gif) Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10588/goblin-rocket-helmet), a Helmet item that will enable you to charge a target and "knocking them silly," which is an incapacitate effect that lasts for over 10 seconds. This can be a great tool too reset the fight, get some bandages off and just let your shorter cool-downs such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_feigndeath.gif) Feign Death](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=5384/feign-death), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_chainsofice.gif) Freezing Trap](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1499/freezing-trap) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_golemstormbolt.gif) Scatter Shot](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19503/scatter-shot) recharge.  
  
[![Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_04.gif) Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18638/hyper-radiant-flame-reflector), [![Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_02.gif) Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18634/gyrofreeze-ice-reflector), and [![Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_16.gif) Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18639/ultra-flash-shadow-reflector) are also from Engineering and can be highly useful in PvP. These Trinkets allow the Hunter to "reflect" various Spells back at the caster. Things like [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_fireball02.gif) Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18809/pyroblast), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_frostbolt02.gif) Frostbolt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25304/frostbolt), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_deathcoil.gif) Death Coil](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17926/death-coil). These can be massively game-changing moments that can turn the tide toward the Hunters' favor if timed properly. The Reflect Buff only lasts for 5 seconds and has a noticeable effect on the Hunter's body, notifying all enemies the Reflector is on (that is if they are paying attention). As a hunter, you will constantly leave combat in 1v1s to kite, so it is easy to swap these trinkets over once you have used them too.  
  
Lastly, [![Goblin Sapper Charge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Sapper Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge) is a massive burst of damage that will also damage yourself slightly. These are good in big AoE PvP battles when you are being advanced on and even in some raid situations to nuke certain annoying mobs. Since the range is so short on these and as a Hunter you will be trying to avoid that melee range, these will not always be so useful.
