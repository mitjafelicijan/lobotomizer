This was a *lot of fun* to play and I must say that the results are quite surprising. I never thought that I would be able to achieve this amount of success with such a build. It won’t turn you into an AoE farming monster that will outclass Mages for example, but it is still able to pull its weight. It is also rather easy to get started, **but** I would personally advise you to wait until you have more gear to make it easier on you.

Your **Tier 2** set is extremely versatile, which is why I advise you to wait; if you don’t like the playstyle, you can easily switch your spec back to healer and your gears will still be suited for the job; so use this to your advantage. If you are super excited to try this build then definitely go ahead but I think that with more gears, you will be able to maximize your time and effort and you will put the odds in your favor if you are ganked.

But I would definitely give it a try if you play on a **PvE server** as this is the best case scenario, you don’t have to worry about other players and you can focus on efficiency. Just be aware that the server I was on during my testing had a rather low population so if you play on a popular server, it might be difficult to farm peacefully without members of either faction messing up your vibe.

What really motivated me to make this guide was the stigma around Paladins that says that they are *only healers or buff dispensers*. I think this is a narrow point of view as you can do much more than that if you have the right gears and the will to try something new and think outside the box. Being a hybrid class has its downsides, yes, but also its upsides and I think that it is better to focus on that than the negative. If you made it this far, you are awesome, and we hope that you enjoyed this new way to play the Paladin, you have all the tools here to succeed if you ever want to try this build. So until next time, hopefully sooner this time, have a good one, and stay blessed!

Talents
-------

[![classic paladin 11 21 19](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Classic-Paladin-11-21-19.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/tools/talent-calculator/paladin#?t=A22222555559B22222777755444aaadddhC2222266644bb99999ee)

This [11/21/19 build](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/tools/talent-calculator/paladin#?t=A22222555559B22222777755444aaadddhC2222266644bb99999ee) is the perfect one to achieve your goal: aoe farm like a boss. While you don’t get any 31 talent points abilities, you actually get much better. In fact, the synergy you get with [consecration](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20924), [blessing-of-sanctuary](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20914) and [improved-retribution-aura](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20092) is amazing. You also pickup some very nice talents along the way that help you with survivability, sustainability and damage which is what you need to succeed!

Stat Priority
-------------

* **Stamina** – For surviving the onslaught
* **Intellect/Spell Power** – For a bigger mana pool and so your spells to hit harder
* **Strength/MP5** – For more damage and shield block value and sustainability
* **Reflect Damage** – For insane passive damage
* **Defense** – For extra survivability

Items (Thorns)
--------------

### Shields

* [thermapluggs-central-core](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9458)
  + This shield is easily obtained from Mekgineer Thermaplugg in Gnomeregan, and has the same green text as the [grand-marshals-aegis](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18825)! Definitely a great item to get you started asap!
* [the-green-tower](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/1204)
  + This low level *epic* shield is a world drop so it might be difficult to get your hands on it but if you do, it is fit for the job.
* [argent-defender](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13243)
  + This item is acquired through a questline that starts with the quest *The Archivist* in Eastern Plaguelands and is a decent shield.
* [crest-of-retribution](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13375)
  + This one drops off Ramstein the Gorger in Stratholme Undead and has built-in thorn damage which synergizes well with the build.
* [drillborer-disk](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/17066)
  + This epic shield drops off Garr in Molten Core and has amazing stats, but do not ninja loot the tanks in your raids though!
* [skullflame-shield](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/1168)
  + This is the best shield for the job as it has Lifesteal on it and a 1% chance to deal **AoE thorn damage** when struck in combat; it doesn’t get better than this!
* [force-reactive-disk](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18168)
  + This engineering-specific shield is good for its AoE damage when you block but will cost you quite a decent amount of gold to repair periodically. I don’t advise you to use this one, but if you already have one crafted, you can try and see how it goes for you.

### Trinkets

Here, you will find a variety of useful trinkets that you can use to make this build shine. Having multiple trinkets in your bags to swap them will guarantee your success!

##### Passive Trinkets:

* [briarwood-reed](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12930)
* [rune-of-the-dawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19812)
* [burst-of-knowledge](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/11832)
* [uthers-strength](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/11302)
* [second-wind](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/11819)
* [essence-of-the-pure-flame](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18815)
* [darkmoon-card-heroism](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19287)
* [darkmoon-card-maelstrom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19289)

##### Active Trinkets:

* [smokeys-lighter](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13171)
* [ragged-johns-neverending-cup](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/15873)
* [smolderwebs-eye](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13213)
* [chained-essence-of-eranikus](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10455)
* [ramsteins-lightning-bolts](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13515)
* [heart-of-the-scale](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13164)
* [fetish-of-chitinous-spikes](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/21488)

### Miscellaneous Gear

* [electromagnetic-gigaflux-reactivator](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9492)
  + This helm is a great piece of gear to add to your arsenal as it gives you a very nice [static-barrier](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/11841)
* [naglering](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/11669)
  + Definitely a *must have* as it gives you very nice tanking stats AND thorn damage!
* [razor-gauntlets](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18326)
  + Decent pair of gloves with thorn damage, but it will only be available in Phase 2 when Dire Maul is released.
* [cloak-of-flames](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/3475)
  + A rare dungeon/raid BoE drop, if you can somehow get your hands on it, it will greatly help with its thorn damage

Consumables
-----------

Now let’s go over some consumables that will make your life a whole lot easier; note that these aren’t the best in their category because the whole idea of this build is to make it viable with the least amount of resources, if it required Naxx BiS, a [thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/19019), a flask and the blood of your mother then it wouldn’t really make sense to show you that; but at the same time, if you have access to more and better consumables, then knock yourself out:

* [crystal-spire](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/11567)
* [oil-of-immolation](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/8956)
* [dragonbreath-chili](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12217)
* [elixir-of-greater-intellect](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9179) + [scroll-of-intellect-iv](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10308)
* [elixir-of-giants](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9206) + [scroll-of-strength-iv](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10310)
* [elixir-of-greater-agility](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9187) + [scroll-of-agility-iv](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10309)
* [arcane-elixir](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9155)
* [elixir-of-greater-defense](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/8951) + [scroll-of-protection-iv](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10305)
* [elixir-of-fortitude](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/3825) + [scroll-of-stamina-iv](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10307)
* [scroll-of-spirit-iv](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10306)
* [thorium-shield-spike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12645) (Although not a consumable properly speaking, it is the only required enchant on your gears)

Gameplay Tips
-------------

#### To achieve quick success, follow this 10 steps formula:

1. Buff up: [blessing-of-sanctuary](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20914)/[retribution-aura](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/10301)/Trinkets & misc items (i.e. [heart-of-the-scale](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13164), [electromagnetic-gigaflux-reactivator](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9492), etc.)/Scrolls/Pots/Friend’s buffs (if applicable)
2. Mount up and gather as much mobs as you can handle (5-10 should be what you’d typically aim for)
3. Once gathered up, drop a max rank [consecration](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20924)
4. Use [seal-of-light](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20349)/[seal-of-wisdom](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20357) and [judgement](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20271) on the target that has to die first
5. Reapply a seal: [seal-of-righteousness](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20154)/[seal-of-light](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20349)/[seal-of-wisdom](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20357)
6. Use Trinkets (i.e. [ramsteins-lightning-bolts](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13515)) and consumables ([oil-of-immolation](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/8956))
7. Heal if necessary (using [concentration aura](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/19746) if needed)
8. Reapply seals and judgements as needed
9. Eat and drink
10. Rinse and repeat!

Grinding Spots
