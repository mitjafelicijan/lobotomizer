Warlocks are WoW Classic’s masters of darkness, dealing fire and shadow damage with their spells and inflicting their enemies with debilitating curses. Their demon minions offer valuable utility and survivability, drawing the attention of mobs while the Warlock deals damage from afar. In raids, Warlocks are often welcome for their solid damage output, particularly in newer versions of WoW Classic where the debuff cap has been removed, allowing the class to utilize all of its DoTs. Warlocks are also required to fill a unique “[caster tank](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/pve-warlock-twin-emperor-tanking/)” role in the [Temple of Ahn’Qiraj](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/temple-of-ahnqiraj-aq40/) raid.

Warlocks are in high demand for their [Ritual of Summoning](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/698), which allows them to summon other players to just about any location. They can also provide a group with [Healthstone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/5509)s, which provide an extra healing option that doesn’t share a cooldown with potions, and [Soulstone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/16893)s, allowing another character (usually a healer) to resurrect immediately if they die. They also have the advantage of being able to earn special summoned mounts at a steep discount compared to other classes.

Roles and Specializations
-------------------------

The three talent trees for Warlocks are **Affliction**, **Demonology**, and **Destruction**.

* **Affliction**
  + Focuses on enhancing the Warlock’s damage-over-time abilities.
  + In old versions of Vanilla WoW where there was a limit to the number of debuffs that could be on any given mob, this tree was often avoided. In newer versions of WoW Classic where the debuff cap is removed, it is considered the strongest DPS build for Warlocks.
* **Demonology**
  + Offers buffs to the Warlock’s survivability as well as the damage and utility of their demon pets.
  + This tree is the strongest for PvP and solo play, but does not offer as much damage as the others for raids.
* **Destruction**
  + Enhances the Warlock’s direct damage spells.
  + Most raid builds go fairly deep into this tree for the Ruin talent, but avoid the capstone ability.

View the complete Warlock talent tree in our [Warlock Talent Calculator](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/tools/talent-calculator/warlock).

Class Feature: Demons
---------------------

Much of a Warlock’s utility comes from their choice of demon pet.

* The **Imp** offers a group-wide Stamina buff with its [Blood Pact](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11767).
* The **Voidwalker** is a tank, albeit an underwhelming one that doesn’t hold threat very well. It offers the Warlock with a powerful survivability cooldown in the form of [Sacrifice](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19443).
* The **Succubus** is often used in PvE for its large mana pool, which combines well with [Dark Pact](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/18938). They are often preferred for PvP due to their [Seduction](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/6358) ability.
* The **Felhunter** gives the Warlock a silence ability with [Spell Lock](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19647) as well as a magic purge/dispel ability with [Devour Magic](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19736), making it a strong choice for PvP.
* The **Infernal** can only be summoned through the [Inferno](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1122) spell, and must be maintained with the [Subjugate Demon](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11726) spell.
* The **Doomguard** must be summoned through a [Ritual of Doom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/18540), which requires a full party and kills one of the participants. It must be maintained with the [Subjugate Demon](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11726) spell.
* Other demons found throughout the world can be controlled temporarily with the [Subjugate Demon](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11726) spell.

Class Feature: Soul Shards
--------------------------

Warlocks have several abilities that consume [Soul Shard](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6265)s, special items that are acquired by killing enemies with [Drain Soul](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8288). The enemies have to be of a level that grants experience, so farming these shards isn’t entirely trivial. The average Warlock will go through many of these shards in a typical raid, as they are used for summoning other players with [Ritual of Summoning](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/698), placing a [Soulstone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/16893) on a player, or summoning [Healthstone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/5509)s to use or hand out to other players.

Warlocks can use special high capacity soul bags for storing their [Soul Shard](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6265)s, but this means sacrificing at least one bag slot. Either way, their inventory space is generally greatly reduced compared to other classes, much like Hunters who must use Quivers to carry their ammo. The tradeoff is that the abilities that use these shards are unique to Warlocks and often put them in high demand. Many Warlocks offer up their summoning services as a way of making extra gold.

Resources
---------

Warlocks use **Mana** as their main ability resource.

Races
-----

I've been playing World of Warcraft on and off since vanilla, usually as a healer or caster and often as a guild leader. I play both retail and classic. I also love RPGs, sandboxes, and sims.
