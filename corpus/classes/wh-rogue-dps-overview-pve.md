Viability of Rogues in WoW Classic PvE Content
----------------------------------------------

[![Rogue](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_rogue.gif) Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue) is one of the best Damage dealing classes in the game. Because of how high their damage output is, most high-end guilds will bring a large number of Rogues with them on Raid night. In Alliance Raids, you will often see 4-6 [![Rogue](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_rogue.gif) Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue) in the Raid. Of course, the Horde will value a Rogue more, because of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=27621/windfury-totem) increasing Melee damage output, Horde often bring 5-8 [![Rogue](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_rogue.gif) Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue) per Raid.  
  
Rogues perform extremely well in the early phases of Classic. Currently, the majority are raiding as Combat, specced for either daggers or swords, with daggers generally considered better at this stage although the difference is largely determined based on what weapon drops are available.

Strengths of Classic Rogues
---------------------------

#### * Can make gold from [Lockpicking Lockpicking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=633/lockpicking) in town or [Pick Pocket](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=921/pick-pocket) in Dungeons

Rogues are incredibly self-sufficient, using their class specific skill, [![Lockpicking](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Lockpicking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=633/lockpicking), to unlock lock boxes for members of their faction. They can also choose to run various dungeons, using [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bag_11.gif) Pick Pocket](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=921/pick-pocket) on most humanoid targets often making a considerable amount of gold. Looting [![Heavy Junkbox](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_box_03.gif) Heavy Junkbox](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16885/heavy-junkbox) from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bag_11.gif) Pick Pocket](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=921/pick-pocket) can lead to quite a bit of gold. You can even loot rare and epic items like a [![Shadowblade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_sword_12.gif) Shadowblade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=2163/shadowblade) out of a [![Heavy Junkbox](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_box_03.gif) Heavy Junkbox](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16885/heavy-junkbox)!

#### * One of the highest damage classes in PvE

Rogues played well are able to be consistently at the top of damage meters. Rogues can choose between using dagger weapons and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_backstab.gif) Backstab](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11281/backstab) or sword weapons and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_ritualofsacrifice.gif) Sinister Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11294/sinister-strike) with different talent specializations to back up each style.

#### * One of the most dangerous Classes in PvP, can win nearly every one versus one encounter

Because a rogue can pick and choose their battles, thanks to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_stealth.gif) Stealth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1787/stealth), a rogue can open on a target when they feel the time is right. This allows the rogue to be an opportunist, taking advantage of enemy players who let their health get too low. Even when a rogue isn't "ganking" someone and chooses to participate in an "honorable" fight, with enough cooldowns up ([![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_vanish.gif) Vanish](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1857/vanish), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_mindsteal.gif) Blind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2094/blind), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_antishadow.gif) Preparation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=14185/preparation)) a rogue can solo nearly any class in the game - especially when the rogue gets the opener.

---

Weaknesses of Classic Rogues
----------------------------

#### * Cooldown dependent

Taking into account the last thing I mentioned, a big problem is a rogue is fairly exposed when all of the major cooldowns are down. Nearly every cooldown ability a rogue has is at a minimum of 5 minutes, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_sprint.gif) Sprint](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11305/sprint), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_shadowward.gif) Evasion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=5277/evasion), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_vanish.gif) Vanish](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1857/vanish), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_mindsteal.gif) Blind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2094/blind). This means you might have to wait quite a long time for all your strong cooldown abilities to be ready! Not many other classes have quite as many 5+ minute cooldowns as necessary for survival as a rogue does.

#### * Reagent heavy, [Blinding Powder Blinding Powder](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=5530/blinding-powder), [Flash Powder Flash Powder](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=5140/flash-powder), Poison Reagents, and [Thistle Tea Thistle Tea](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=7676/thistle-tea)

Speaking of long cooldowns, a lot of these abilities also require a reagent! [![Blinding Powder](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_ammo_gunpowder_01.gif) Blinding Powder](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=5530/blinding-powder) and [![Flash Powder](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_powder_purple.gif) Flash Powder](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=5140/flash-powder) are both must have at all times, allowing a rogue to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_mindsteal.gif) Blind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2094/blind) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_vanish.gif) Vanish](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1857/vanish), respectively. Not only that, but your poisons are a big part of what makes you a rogue, and those are required to be crafted and in your bags. Lastly, no rogue is complete without at least one stack of [![Thistle Tea](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_drink_milk_05.gif) Thistle Tea](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=7676/thistle-tea) in the backpack!

#### * Rogues are one of the most common Classes

The biggest weakness of all, rogues are *everywhere*! It can be difficult winning the rolls for various items in a Raid or even just finding a group, for a raid or a dungeon, because there will be so many rogues online at any given time! If you are the type of person that doesn't want to compete with a large pool of players, you will likely not have a good time playing Rogue.

Best Races for PvE WoW Classic Rogues
-------------------------------------

Seven races can be rogues in WoW Classic: [![Dwarf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_dwarf_male.gif) Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf), [![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human), [![Gnome](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_gnome_male.gif) Gnome](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=7/gnome), and [![Night Elf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_nightelf_male.gif) Night Elf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=4/night-elf) for the Alliance, and [![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc), [![Undead](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_scourge_male.gif) Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead), [![Troll](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_troll_male.gif) Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) for the Horde.

### Best Race for Alliance Rogues

[![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) is the best Classic WoW AlliancerRogue race for PvE. [![Gnome](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_gnome_male.gif) Gnome](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=7/gnome), [![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human), or [![Dwarf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_dwarf_male.gif) Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) are good choices for Classic WoW Alliance rogue race for PvP, each with different strengths.  
  
Alliance [![Rogue](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_rogue.gif) Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue) have the benefit of raiding with a Paladin, which can buff the rogue with powerful blessings such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_fistofjustice.gif) Blessing of Might](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25291/blessing-of-might) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_magearmor.gif) Blessing of Kings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20217/blessing-of-kings). A paladin also uses various auras, giving a buff to all party members, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_devotionaura.gif) Devotion Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10293/devotion-aura), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_sealoffire.gif) Fire Resistance Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19900/fire-resistance-aura), but the paladin might also be using [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_mindsooth.gif) Concentration Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19746/concentration-aura), which doesn't benefit the rogue.

#### [Human Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) Rogue

Humans are, without a doubt, the best PvE Raiding Alliance Race because of the incredible racial [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_meleedamage.gif) Sword Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20597/sword-specialization). Having a higher weapon skill reduces the odds you will miss an attack, reduces the chance the target can block, dodge, or parry your attacks, and most importantly reduces the damage penalty of glancing blows when attacking a higher level target. Weapon skill goes an incredibly long way in PvE content, increasing your overall damage by a significant margin. As for PvP, Humans are decent. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20600/perception) can increase your chance of getting the opener versus another [![Rogue](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_rogue.gif) Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue) in the world, which makes a huge difference when fighting the mirror match. Of course, you can always catch a [![Druid](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_druid.gif) Druid](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=11/druid) who is [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Prowl](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9913/prowl)ing nearby, as well.

#### Racial Bonuses

#### [Dwarf Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) Rogue

Dwarves are one of the best PvP races for a Rogue. Again, the racial mostly only helps against other [![Rogue](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_rogue.gif) Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform) will allow you to remove all poison effects on you, but more importantly it allows the Dwarf to break out of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_mindsteal.gif) Blind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2094/blind)! [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform) has other uses as well, allowing the Dwarf to remove a [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) bleeds, or even an [![Undead](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_scourge_male.gif) Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest)'s [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_blackplague.gif) Devouring Plague](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19280/devouring-plague)! It is extremely useful to have [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform) to remove damage over time effects, allowing the Dwarf to cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_vanish.gif) Vanish](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1857/vanish), without it breaking shortly after. As for PvE raiding, Dwarf has no damage dealing benefits.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_dwarf_findtreasure.gif) Find Treasure](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2481/find-treasure): Allows the dwarf to sense nearby treasure, making it appear on the minimap
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_wizardmark.gif) Frost Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20596/frost-resistance): Increases Frost Resistance by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_musket_03.gif) Gun Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20595/gun-specialization): Guns skill increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_unholystrength.gif) Stoneform](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20594/stoneform): While active, grants immunity to Bleed, Poison, and Disease effects. In addition, Armor increased by 10%. Lasts 8 sec.

#### [Night Elf Night Elf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=4/night-elf) Rogue

Night Elf has nearly no benefits for a rogue. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Shadowmeld](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20580/shadowmeld) doesn't do much, other than passively increasing your [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_stealth.gif) Stealth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1787/stealth) level. While choosing to play Night Elf doesn't have much of an impact in PvE or PvP, Night Elves do start with the highest agility of any of the Races, but this is a fairly minor benefit. Compared to Dwarves, the Night Elf will always have 9 more agility, even in matching gear.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritarmor.gif) Nature Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20583/nature-resistance): Nature Resistance increased by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Wisp Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20585/wisp-spirit): Transform into a wisp upon death, increasing movement speed by 50%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_shadowmeld.gif) Quickness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20582/quickness): Dodge chance increased by 1%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Shadowmeld](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20580/shadowmeld): Activate to slip into the shadows, reducing the chance for enemies to detect your presence. Lasts until cancelled or upon moving. Night Elf Rogues and Druids with Shadowmeld are more difficult to detect while stealthed or prowling.

#### [Gnome Gnome](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=7/gnome) Rogue

Gnomes are the absolute best Alliance PvP race for Rogue, thanks to their racial ability [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_trip.gif) Escape Artist](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20589/escape-artist). One of the easiest ways to control a rogue is to use immobilize effects, such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_frostnova.gif) Frost Nova](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10230/frost-nova), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_stranglevines.gif) Entangling Roots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9853/entangling-roots), or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_shockwave.gif) Improved Hamstring](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23695/improved-hamstring). This is known as "peeling" in PvP, where a player uses slow and immobilize effects to effectively "peel" a melee character off of their ally. While rogues do have access to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_sprint.gif) Improved Sprint](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=13875/improved-sprint) in the Combat tree, Gnome rogues can forego that for other talents, increasing their damage output and going for more aggressive talents such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_ice_lament.gif) Cold Blood](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=14177/cold-blood) in the Assassination tree. As for PvE raiding, Gnome has no damage dealing benefits.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Arcane Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20592/arcane-resistance): Arcane Resistance increased.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_essenceeternallarge.gif) Expansive Mind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20591/expansive-mind): Intelligence increased by 5%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gear_01.gif) Engineering Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20593/engineering-specialization): Engineering skill increased by 15.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_trip.gif) Escape Artist](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20589/escape-artist): Escape the effects of any immobilization or movement speed reduction effect.

### Best Race for Horde Rogues

[![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) is the best Classic WoW Horde Rogue race for PvE. [![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) or [![Undead](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_scourge_male.gif) Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) is the best Classic WoW Horde Rogue race For PvP.  
  
Horde [![Rogue](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_rogue.gif) Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue) have the benefit of raiding with a Shaman, which has access to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=27621/windfury-totem), an insanely powerful boost to a rogue's damage output. For [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=27621/windfury-totem) to work, the rogue has to forego applying a poison to the main hand. It's also important to understand that [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_sword_27.gif) Sword Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=13964/sword-specialization) auto attacks can trigger a [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=27621/windfury-totem), and vice versa, allowing the rogue to output an avalanche of auto attacks throughout a raid boss fight.

#### [Orc Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) Rogue

Orcs are the absolute best PvP Race in the game, period. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_23.gif) Hardiness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20573/hardiness) is so powerful, Blizzard had no choice but to nerf it a total of **three** times, leading up to Warlords of Draenor. In the classic version of the game the true power of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_23.gif) Hardiness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20573/hardiness) will be realized once again. Every character in World of Warcraft has a base 5% chance to resist a stun effect. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_23.gif) Hardiness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20573/hardiness) increases your stun resist chance, effectively giving the Orc a 30% chance to resist incoming stuns. Things like [![Iron Grenade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_08.gif) Iron Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4390/iron-grenade), [![Tidal Charm](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_rune_01.gif) Tidal Charm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=1404/tidal-charm), or even an enemy rogue's [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_kidneyshot.gif) Kidney Shot](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=8643/kidney-shot), all can be resisted. It's also important to mention that the rogue's PvP trinket ([![Insignia of the Horde](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_trinketpvp_02.gif) Insignia of the Horde](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18849/insignia-of-the-horde)) does not remove stun effects, only increasing the power of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_23.gif) Hardiness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20573/hardiness). As for PvE, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_orc_berserkerstrength.gif) Blood Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20572/blood-fury) only gets more and more powerful as the rogue acquires better gear and more attack power. It is a strong damage boosting racial for PvE.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_02.gif) Axe Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20574/axe-specialization) - Skill with Axes and Two-Handed Axes increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_orc_berserkerstrength.gif) Blood Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20572/blood-fury) - Increases base melee attack power by 25% for 15 sec and reduces healing effects on you by 50% for 25 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_warcry.gif) Command](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20575/command) - Damage dealt by Hunter and Warlock pets increased by 5%.

#### [Undead Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) Rogue

When it comes to PvP, Undead is a formidable race for rogues because of the racial ability [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_raisedead.gif) Will of the Forsaken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=7744/will-of-the-forsaken). It is a strictly better [![Insignia of the Horde](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_trinketpvp_02.gif) Insignia of the Horde](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18849/insignia-of-the-horde), being only a 2-minute cooldown, versus 5 minutes. Furthermore, with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_raisedead.gif) Will of the Forsaken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=7744/will-of-the-forsaken), you can essentially have another trinket slot, because you won't need to carry your insignia. As for PvE raiding, Undead has no damage dealing benefits but an extra way to break out of fear will come in handy for a few bosses.

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_cannibalize.gif) Cannibalize](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20577/cannibalize): When activated, regenerates 7% of total health every 2 sec for 10 sec. Only works on Humanoid or Undead corpses within 5 yds. Any movement, action, or damage taken while Cannibalizing will cancel the effect.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_detectinvisibility.gif) Shadow Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20579/shadow-resistance): Shadow Resistance increased by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_demonbreath.gif) Underwater Breathing](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=5227/underwater-breathing): Underwater breath lasts 300% longer than normal.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_raisedead.gif) Will of the Forsaken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=7744/will-of-the-forsaken): Provides immunity to Charm, Fear and Sleep while active. May also be used while already afflicted by Charm, Fear or Sleep. Lasts 5 sec.

#### [Troll Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) Rogue

Trolls are pretty close to Orc when it comes to PvE. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_troll_berserk.gif) Berserking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=26296/berserking) provides a activated temporary boost to your damage output, similar to an Orc's [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_orc_berserkerstrength.gif) Blood Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20572/blood-fury). [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_regenerate.gif) Regeneration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20555/regeneration) is also fairly robust, essentially giving you a higher health pool during a raid boss fight, potentially giving your healers more time to toss a heal your way. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pelt_bear_ruin_02.gif) Beast Slaying](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20557/beast-slaying) won't have a significant impact in PvE raiding, as there aren't that many Beast type enemies.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pelt_bear_ruin_02.gif) Beast Slaying](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20557/beast-slaying): Damage dealt versus Beasts increased by 5%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_troll_berserk.gif) Berserking](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20554/berserking): Increases your casting and attack speed by 10% to 30%. At full health, the speed increase is 10% with a greater effect up to 30% if you are badly hurt when you activate Berserking. Lasts 10 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_bow_12.gif) Bow Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=26290/bow-specialization): Skill with Bow Weapons increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_regenerate.gif) Regeneration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20555/regeneration): Health regeneration rate increased by 10%. 10% of total Health regeneration may continue during combat.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_throwingaxe_03.gif) Throwing Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20558/throwing-specialization): Skill with Throwing Weapons increased by 5.

WoW Classic Rogue DPS Specializations
-------------------------------------

There are three specialization talent trees for Classic Rogues: Assassination, Combat, and Subtlety. Classes in Classic WoW will earn a total of 51 talent points, allowing them to take talents from multiple trees, though most builds typically invest the majority of their points in one tree, while taking only select bonuses in the others. Rogues have several viable talent combinations, depending on whether the player is interested in PvE or PvP.   
  
 **Assassination:** A deadly master of poisons who dispatches victims with vicious dagger strikes.

* [Seal Fate builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/rogue/dps-talent-builds-pve#seal-fate-daggers) depend on critical strikes from their combo point builders in order to generate extra combo points and funnel damage into a single target, though the dagger variants are dependent on attacking from behind with Backstab.

 **Combat:** A ruthless fugitive who uses agility and guile to stand toe-to-toe with enemies.

* [Combat Swords builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/rogue/dps-talent-builds-pve#combat-swords) stack hit and the chance to trigger extra attacks with swords in order to deal a large amount of sustained auto attack damage, supplemented by powerful cooldowns for two-target and bust damage capability.
* [Combat Daggers builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/rogue/dps-talent-builds-pve#combat-daggers) trade the extra attack effect of sword specialization for the extra critical strike chance of Dagger specialization, while taking up many of the same valuable talents in the Combat tree.

 **Subtlety:** A dark stalker who leaps from the shadows to ambush unsuspecting prey.

* [Cold Blood Hemorrhage builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/rogue/dps-talent-builds-pve#cold-blood-hemorrhage) are capable of stunlocking and near one shotting vulnerable targets in PvP, however the build and Rogues in general are extremely cooldown driven and considerably weaker when caught without them available.

### Best Rogue Spec for PvE in WoW Classic

Combat Rogues are the best spec for Rogues in the early phases of Classic WoW. They will choose between [Combat Swords (19/32)](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/rogue/dps-talent-builds-pve#pve-talent-builds-for-rogues) or [Combat Daggers (15/31/5)](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/rogue/dps-talent-builds-pve#combat-daggers), depending on what are the best weapons available. Many Rogues will stick with Daggers, but it largely depends on which weapons you can actually get your hands on. If you can get much stronger swords than you can daggers, you may deal more damage switching to a sword specialization.  
  
Viable end-game PvE builds are covered in our [Classic Rogue DPS Talents & Builds Guide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/rogue/dps-talent-builds-pve).

Best Professions for Classic Rogues
-----------------------------------

### [Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Engineering is an absolute must-have if you are trying to go the extra mile in PvE or PvP. In PvE, you should go [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/trade_engineering.gif) Gnomish Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20220/gnomish-engineering), allowing you to craft [![Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_polymorphchicken.gif) Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10725/gnomish-battle-chicken), a Bind on Pickup Trinket that summons a Pet. After being summoned, the Battle Chicken will attack the nearest target and has a chance on hit to trigger a Battle shout, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_birdbeck_01.gif) Battle Squawk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23060/battle-squawk), which increases the Melee Attack Speed by all party members by 5%. Also in PvE, you will be able to use [![Dense Dynamite](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_06.gif) Dense Dynamite](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18641/dense-dynamite), a bomb that deals ~400 damage, which only has a cooldown of 60 seconds, which can be a significant boost in damage.  
  
In PvP, Engineering changes everything. Because Rogues can really only do damage within Melee range, many classes will try to "kite" the Rogue, by applying Slows or Immobilization effects and creating distance. With something like [![Iron Grenade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_08.gif) Iron Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4390/iron-grenade), a Rogue can Stun the target and allow the Rogue to catch up, allowing the Rogue to continue dealing damage. There is also the super-powerful [![Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_49.gif) Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10588/goblin-rocket-helmet), a Helmet item that will enable you to charge a target and "knocking them silly," which is an incapacitate effect that lasts for over 10 seconds. This can be a great tool to close the distance, as well as a great way to keep a target Crowd Controlled for a longer period.  
  
I also can't mention Engineering and PvP without talking about the Reflector Trinkets. [![Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_04.gif) Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18638/hyper-radiant-flame-reflector), [![Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_02.gif) Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18634/gyrofreeze-ice-reflector), and [![Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_16.gif) Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18639/ultra-flash-shadow-reflector). These Trinkets allow the Rogue to "reflect" various Spells back at the caster. Things like [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_fireball02.gif) Pyroblast](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18809/pyroblast), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_frostbolt02.gif) Frostbolt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25304/frostbolt), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_deathcoil.gif) Death Coil](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17926/death-coil). These can be massively game-changing moments that can turn the tide toward the Rogue's favor if timed properly. The Reflect Buff only lasts for 5 seconds and has a noticeable effect on the Rogue's body, notifying all enemies the Reflector is on (that is if they are paying attention). Lastly, [![Goblin Sapper Charge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Sapper Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge) is a massive burst of damage. With this Consumable, a Rogue can easily kill an enemy player in a single chain of Stuns, bursting a target down.

Classic Rogue Class Mechanics
-----------------------------

*The rogue is one of the most lethal character classes in the game, able to deal out immense damage in a short period of time. The most effective rogues sneak through the shadows without detection, and then strike enemies from behind with a flurry of assassination attacks. Yet, for all their fast-hitting power, rogues are not very durable, relying on quickness and stealth for protection instead of armor and high health.* - World of Warcraft Game Manual, 2004

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | One of the most unique things about the Rogue class is the use of Energy as a resource to activate Abilities, instead of the more common resource, Mana. Rogues are also unique because they use Combo Points to trigger powerful Attacks; a target can have up to five combo points on them at a time. Another unique aspect of Rogue, is the use of  [Poisons](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2842/poisons), allowing the Rogue to apply harmful effects to their weapons, increasing their assassination skills. A Rogue will also use  [Stealth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1784/stealth), sneaking around creatures and slipping undetected behind enemy lines. |

### Energy

*Energy is used to power rogue abilities. Unlike mana or health, energy does not improve with level, nor is it influenced by any attribute. A rogue’s energy bar always starts at 100 points, unless modified by a rogue talent. When a rogue uses a special attack or ability, it costs energy points. Energy replenishes reasonably quickly over time, so a rogue can continue to perform special attacks during a battle. However, energy regeneration isn’t rapid enough to allow a rogue to continue to use many abilities indefinitely. The rage bar is displayed in yellow underneath the character's health bar.* - World of Warcraft Game Manual, 2004

All [![Rogue](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_rogue.gif) Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue) start with 100 Energy, unless of course, some decide to take the Talent [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_earthbindtotem.gif) Vigor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=14983/vigor) in the Assassination Tree, which is not recommended. Every 2 Seconds, Rogues will gain 20 Energy, which is known as an "Energy Tick." So, when a Rogue is at 0 Energy, it would take 10 seconds, or five Ticks to pool enough energy to get back to 100. A vital resource for a Rogue is an addon known as "Energy Watch." Energy Watch creates a small bar that fills up every 2 seconds, indicating an Energy Tick.  
  
Pooling Energy is when a Rogue chooses not to spend Energy, saving up Energy for a large amount, to quickly spend in a flurry of attacks. Pooling is essential when a Rogue wants to wait for an important Cooldown to come up or to time their Abilities with a proc like the [Crusader Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20034), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofstrength.gif) Holy Strength](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20007/holy-strength). These three things are all vital to understand as a [![Rogue](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_rogue.gif) Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue), because these are small mechanics that can be taken advantage of, to increase a Rogue's Damage in a Raid.




### Combo Points

*Combo points are only generated when the rogue uses specific special attacks or abilities. The rogue's powerful finishing moves require combo points to use, in addition to the regular energy expenditure. A rogue can accumulate a maximum of five combo points. You can see how many combo points you have by looking at the target monster's NPC portrait. The combo points appear as red dots.  
  
When a finishing move is executed, all combo points are spent, and the move takes effect. A minimum of one combo point is required to use the finishing move, but the more combo points spent, the greater the effect.* - World of Warcraft Game Manual, 2004

Combo Points are another mechanic unique to [![Rogue](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_rogue.gif) Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue). Combo Points are generated from specific moves, such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_ritualofsacrifice.gif) Sinister Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11294/sinister-strike), which will add a Red Circle next to the target's portrait. If the Rogue changes to a new enemy Target, all previous Combo Points will be lost. An Enemy Target can have a maximum of 5 Combo Points at once, allowing these Points to be consumed when the Rogue uses a "Finisher", such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_eviscerate.gif) Eviscerate](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=31016/eviscerate), gaining a stronger effect, the more Combo Points consumed.

### [Poisons](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2842/poisons)

Rogues get Poisons at Level 20. Alliance Rogues can start a Quest Chain that begins with [![Mathias and the Defias](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/quest-start.gif) Mathias and the Defias](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2360/mathias-and-the-defias), while Horde Rogues start a Quest Chain with [![Mission: Possible But Not Probable](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/quest-start.gif) Mission: Possible But Not Probable](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2478/mission-possible-but-not-probable). After completing a few quests, the Rogue will be rewarded with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/trade_brewpoison.gif) Poisons](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2842/poisons) and [![Recipe: Thistle Tea](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_scroll_03.gif) Recipe: Thistle Tea](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18160/recipe-thistle-tea), a massively powerful Consumable that every Rogue should have on them at all times. Poison Skill Rating is granted to the Rogue each level, increasing the Max Skill Rating by 5. A Level 30 Rogue will have 150 Skill Rating, whereas a Level 60 Rogue will have 300 Skill Rating. Reagents for crafting Poisons can be purchased from Vendors with the title <Poison Supplies> in capital cities, near Rogue Trainers. After purchasing the necessary Reagents and Vials, Rogues will be able to craft Poisons of their choice.

The best Poisons to use on your Weapons depends on what you are doing and what you are attacking. In almost every PvE encounter as an Alliance Rogue, you will want [![Instant Poison VI](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_poisons.gif) Instant Poison VI](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8928/instant-poison-vi) on both of your Swords, as [![Instant Poison VI](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_poisons.gif) Instant Poison VI](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8928/instant-poison-vi) can proc even on the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_meleedamage.gif) Sword Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20597/sword-specialization) Auto Attacks. [![Deadly Poison V](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_dualweild.gif) Deadly Poison V](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20844/deadly-poison-v) is technically more damage over a longer fight, but it does take up one of the sixteen Debuff slots on the Raid Boss, lowering the total Raid's damage potential. For this reason, you should never use [![Deadly Poison V](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_dualweild.gif) Deadly Poison V](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20844/deadly-poison-v) while Raiding. As a Horde Rogue, you will only apply [![Instant Poison VI](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_poisons.gif) Instant Poison VI](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8928/instant-poison-vi) to your Off Hand weapon, allowing your Main Hand to benefit from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=27621/windfury-totem).  
  
In PvP encounters, you will almost always want [![Crippling Poison II](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_19.gif) Crippling Poison II](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=3776/crippling-poison-ii) applied to both your Main Hand and Off Hand weapon, allowing you to Slow your target as often as possible. If you come across a Spell Caster such as a Mage, Warlock, or a Priest, it might be beneficial for the Rogue to stay in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_stealth.gif) Stealth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1787/stealth) and change the Off Hand Poison to [![Mind-numbing Poison III](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_nullifydisease.gif) Mind-numbing Poison III](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=9186/mind-numbing-poison-iii), allowing you to slow down the Spell Caster's cast time, allowing you to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_kick.gif) Kick](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1769/kick) more often. This can also apply to [![Wound Poison IV](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_poisonsting.gif) Wound Poison IV](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10922/wound-poison-iv), when coming across Healers in the world. It is important to remember that most Healer classes will also have a [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_nullifypoison.gif) Cure Poison](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=8946/cure-poison) type spell, allowing them to get out of [![Crippling Poison II](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_potion_19.gif) Crippling Poison II](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=3776/crippling-poison-ii) and get away!
