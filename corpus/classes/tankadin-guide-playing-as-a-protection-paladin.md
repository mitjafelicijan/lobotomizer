This guide is written to help players that want to try tanking as a Protection Paladin in World of Warcraft Classic. Note that there are a few things to keep in mind as this is not an easy role to fill:

* Most people will think of you as inferior to a warrior or druid tank.
* Use all consumables that you can.
* While playing a Protection Paladin at level 60 can be challenging if the group is not willing to work with you a bit, it’s more than possible to be successful.

### Why Tankadins Are Good

* The best AoE threat generation in the game.
* The ability to generate threat without having to worry about being rage starved.
* Able to [Cleanse](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/4987).
* Able to wipe out every debuff in the game – for 15 mana (only paladins are capable of doing this).

While we don’t have a traditional taunt ability, there are a couple of ways to monitor and regain aggro:

1. We can use [Blessing of Protection](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/10278) on whomever has aggro, allowing us the opportunity to generate enough threat to maintain aggro when the bubble either wears off or is cancelled by the player.
2. We can use items such as [Masterwork Target Dummy](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/16023) from [Engineering](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/engineering-1-300/) that makes all mobs in the vicinity focus on it until it’s dead, allowing for you to generate some additional threat or for your group to burn the mobs down while they’re focused on the [Masterwork Target Dummy](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/16023).

#### [Protection Paladin Stats in Vanilla WoW](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Protection-Paladin-Stats-in-Vanilla-WoW.jpg)

### Stats

* **Stamina**: 1 Stamina gives you:
  + 10 Health Points
* **Defencs**: The more Defense you have, the less likely you are to be the victim of a critical strike. (Critical strikes = 200% regular damage, so they can be nasty!) To ensure you don’t experience this, you would reach 440 Defense. However, due to [Redoubt](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20137) and [Reckoning](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20182) requiring receiving critical strikes, we don’t want to achieve this. But with every point of Defense you obtain, you’ll also receive 0.04% in Dodge, Block, Parry and Miss, totaling 0.20% total avoidance per point of Defense.
* **Agility**: 1 Agility gives you:
  + 2 Armor
  + 0.05% Dodge
  + 0.05% Melee Critical Strike
* **Strength**: 1 Strength gives you:
  + 2 Melee Attack Power
  + 0.20 Block Value
* **Intellect**: 1 Intellect gives you:
  + 15 Mana
  + 0.02% Spell Critical Strike
* **Spell Damage**: Spell damage increases the amount of damage your spells cause. As a Protection Paladin, here are the coefficients that we care about:
  + [Consecration](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20924): 33-35% of your spell damage
  + [Holy Shield](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20928): 20% of your spell damage
  + [Seal of Righteousness](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20293): 11% of your spell damage
  + [Judgement of Righteousness](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20293): 50% of your spell damage
  + [Exorcism](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/10314): 45% of your spell damage
* **Mana per 5**: This is an important stat for Protection Paladins since we rely exclusively on spells for our threat generation. Items from the [Deathbone Guardian](https://wowclassicdb.com/itemset/124) set are a great addition to any paladin’s inventory when first starting out tanking at level 60. With a misleading name, Mp5 ticks every two seconds, rather than every 5.

### Abilities

![Righteous Fury](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Righteous-Fury.jpg)

**[Righteous Fury](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/25780):**

If you are tanking you want this up at all times, **DO NOT** forget to use this before a boss fight or whenever you are just sitting not doing anything and have the mana. With [Improved Righteous Fury](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20470), this causes your holy spells to cause 90% additional threat. It is imperative to have this up at all times when tanking.

![Seal of Righteousness](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Seal-of-Righteousness.png)

**[Seal of Righteousness](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20293):**

This is the standard seal used when tanking inside dungeons. It provides threat on each successful melee attack, while if the boss or target dodges, parries or your attack just misses, your [Seal of Righteousness](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20293) won’t generate any threat.

![Seal of Wisdom](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Seal-of-Wisdom.png)

**[Seal of Wisdom](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20357):**

[Seal of Wisdom](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20357) and its corresponding [Judgement](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20271) effect are nearly mandatory for the longer fights when we’re tanking them. This is mainly used in raids since our threat does not come from [Seal of Righteousness](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20293) in raids.

![Judgment](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Judgment.png)

**[Judgement](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20271):**

[Judgement](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20271) is the spell we use to either cause a significant amount of damage from [Seal of Righteousness](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20293) or place debuffs on the target with [Seal of Light](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20349) or [Seal of Wisdom](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20357). Most of the time in dungeons you’ll be using [Seal of Righteousness](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20293) and [Judgement](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20271) followed by a reapplication since the mobs will likely die too soon for [Seal of Wisdom](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20357) to be beneficial. In raids, however, we don’t use [Seal of Righteousness](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20293) for threat, so [Seal of Wisdom](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20357) and [Judgement](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20271) is used instead.

![Consecration](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Consecration.png)

**[Consecration](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20924):**

[Consecration](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20924) is one of the few reasons paladins are easier to play when it comes to AoE tanking. It does have a hefty mana cost, coming in at 565 for Rank 5, but the threat it puts out is well worth the cost. (Sitting at 0 spell damage, it works out to be 91.2 threat per second) It should be mentioned that it is possible to downrank your spells if you are running low on mana, as any threat is better than none.

![Holy Shield](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Holy-Shield.gif)

**[Holy Shield](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20928):**

[Holy Shield](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20928) increases our chance to block by 30% for a maximum of 4 blocks for a duration of 10 seconds. [Holy Shield](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20928) has a threat modifier of 20%, so at Rank 3, [Holy Shield](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20928) causes roughly 296.4 threat per block. ([Holy Shield](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20928)‘s damage is 130, multiplied by 1.20, totaling 156, and because it’s Holy spell damage, [Righteous Fury](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/25780) increases that threat by 90% for a grand total of 296.4)

![Blessing of Sanctuary](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blessing-of-Sanctuary.png)

**[Blessing of Sanctuary](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20914):**

[Blessing of Sanctuary](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20914) causes you to take up to 24 less damage from all sources (physical and magical) while also causing 35 holy damage on every successful block. Combined with [Holy Shield](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20928), this is a great tool for threat generation, causing 66.5 threat per block.

![Vanilla WoW Devotion Aura](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Auras.png)

**Auras:**

More often than not, [Retribution Aura](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/10301) will be the go-to aura for Protection Paladins since it provides 38 passive threat on all attacks that hit us (including partial blocks, too). If your healer(s) is/are having a tough time keeping you alive, you can use [Devotion Aura](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/10293) for a very slight reduction in physical damage taken. If you’re tanking a caster mob, both [Retribution](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/10301) and [Devotion Aura](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/10293) are useless and you should change to a resistance aura.

![Blessing of Protection](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Blessing-of-Protection.png)

**[Blessing of Protection](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/10278):**

This allows you to “bubble” a party or raid member, forcing any physical-attacking mob to focus on the second person on their threat table (Hopefully, that’s you!) Keep in mind that this does NOT include casters, they will still fire away at your target since they’re not protected from magical damage.

![Divine Protection Rank 1](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Divine-Protection-Rank-1.gif)

**[Divine Protection Rank 1](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/498):**

This is one of the Paladin’s best traits. Simply by spending 15 mana, we can eliminate any debuffs in the game (with the exception of [Forbearance](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/25771), of course). With the help of a macro, we can use this and still maintain aggro over the target by casting it, and then immediately cancelling the effect:

```
#showtooltip Divine Protection
/cast Divine Protection
/cancel Divine Protection
```

![Cleanse](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Cleanse.png)

**[Cleanse](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/4987):**

Allows the Paladin to remove 1 poison, 1 disease, and 1 magic effect. Incredibly helpful and useful!

### Talents

**[11/31/9](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/tools/talent-calculator/paladin?t=A11111666669B2222244477777999aaabbbbbhmmmmmpC222226666)**

This talent build is aimed for raid-tanking at level 60. It’s vital for you to pick up [Blessing of Kings](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20217) so that you can learn [Greater Blessing of Kings](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/25898) (at level 60) since that’s how we generate 95% of our threat while in raids. Since [Greater Blessing of Kings](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/25898) is learned at level 60, its baseline threat is 60, multiplied by 1.90, for a total of 114 threat. This means that if you buff five players, you’ll be generating  570 threat every global cooldown.

[![pve paladin protection talents wow classic standard build](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/PvE-Paladin-Protection-Talents-WoW-Classic-Standard-Build.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/tools/talent-calculator/paladin?t=A11111666669B2222244477777999aaabbbbbhmmmmmpC222226666)

The reality of the situation is that [One-Handed Weapon Specialization](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/16542) is pretty useless for us since our melee damage is never relied on for threat. [Reckoning](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20182) is beneficial in raiding content since we’ll be relying on mana regeneration to allow us to generate threat and extra swings (especially with [Flurry Axe](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/871)) are always a welcome sight with [Seal and Judgement of Wisdom](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20357). If necessary, you can move one point from [Precision](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20193) into [Anticipation](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20100) for an added 0.32% overall avoidance.

If I'm not working or spending time with the family I'm probably gaming. Some of my favorite recent games I've played are Far Cry 5, World of Warcraft Classic, and 7 Days to Die.
