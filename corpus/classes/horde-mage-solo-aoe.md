This guide discusses the leveling route that I think is the best for mage in Classic WoW. I based the information off of stress test data, private server data, and from what other players in the beta discovered. The guide mostly quests from levels 1-22 and then prioritizes AOE grinding to 60 from there. I included multiple AOE farm locations for each level range to try to help in the case that a spot is already camped on all layers (after layering there will be less competition on leveling mobs). Then I also added in some quest zones (that are the most efficient for mage IMO) that you can do if you get bored of grinding.

Talents
-------

![horde mage solo aoe talents](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Horde-Mage-Solo-AoE-Talents.jpg)

If you AREN’T mostly AoE farming, I recommend deep frost to get the shatter combo, or you can get wand spec in the arcane tree.

For AoE farming I get wand spec and arcane concentration before going back to the frost tree because a free blizzard is huge, even though its not as powerful as on private servers (also the arcane hit chance is nice for finishing pulls with arcane explosion).

You can also drop points out of improved frostbolt for other things (shatter mainly) in the frost tree if you feel the need, I just like the 1 sec cast on rank 1 frostbolt for pulling groups, also just for when I single target a mob down/pvp

**Here is the build that I will be using:**

* [Level 1-39 Talents](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/tools/talent-calculator/mage#?t=C2220077766bbb91ccdddhiii111188)
* [Level 40-46 Talents](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/tools/talent-calculator/mage#?t=C2220077766bbb98ccdddhiii884444p4eeeee)
* [Level 47-60 Talents](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/tools/talent-calculator/mage#?t=C2220077766bbb98ccdddhiii884444pA001116666644C4eeeeeA99)

Class Quests
------------

I only do the Mage’s Wand quest, Celestial Power quest, and Destroy Morphaz quest (do destroy Morphaz at 60 most likely, and you can do the same with others but they can be nice to have while leveling)…other than these 3 I don’t recommend any of the others.

* [Mage’s Wand](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/1952): (lvl 40 wand) (2 prereqs)
* [Celestial Power](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/1958): (restore mana OH)
* [Destroy Morphaz](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/8253): (16 sp neck) (do at 60)

Stat Priority
-------------

Stam = Int > Spirit > Spell Power > Agi = Str

Your goal is to get the biggest health and mana pool as possible to make AOE grinding easier, since spellpower doesn’t have a good coefficient on AOE spells.

Spell Efficiencies (Dmg/Mana)

**Frostbolt:**

* Lvl 4 r1=0.78 **best 4-6**

* Lvl 6 r2=0.85555 (0.92222) **best 6-8**
* Lvl 12 r3=0.97692 (1.06923) **best 12-14**

**Arcane Explosion**

* Lvl 14 r1=0.46 worth on 3 mobs or more

Leveling & Farming Spots
------------------------

### Lvl 1-5 Starting Zone

* Skip 1st quest, (just farm to lvl 2)
* Bat/Wolf Quest is level 2
* boxes/spider quest=lvl3 samuel also lvl 3 (skip unless lucky)
* The Scarlet Crusade quest (lvl 4)
* Get to 5 asap to go to tirisfal glades

### Lvl 5-10 Tirisfal Glades

* Try to get to LVL 6 before making it to Brill, (do the gloom weed quest [[Gordo’s Task](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3164)] and pumpkin quest [[Fields of Grief](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/365)] while killing things)
* Level 6 allows you to train new spells and get extra quests before doing a big round of quests in the zone
* Set Hearth in Brill / Learn First Aid
* Get to lvl 10 ASAP then immediately go to UC then Silverpine

### Lvl 10 Undercity

* Set hearth in UC
* Train 10 skills
* Buy dagger & 1h sword skill for 10s each
* Exit out sewers

### Lvl 10-12 Silverpine

* Hold onto 6 [discolored worg hearts](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/3164) for quest later
* Get to at least lvl 12, but mainly try to complete all the low level silverpine quests that are green or yellow unless one is congested
* Before the Barens: If you can afford it, buy a lvl 15 wand from wand vendor (33s 40c) at Undercity before leaving because it is faster than trying to do a high level wand quest at 13 where you risk dying, however if someone is selling one of the Enchanting wands you can buy one of those also I would not recommend leveling enchanting yourself if your goal is speed leveling

### Lvl 12-17 The Barrens

**KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR CHEN’S EMPTY KEG**

[![wow classic horde mage solo aoe lvl 12 17 the barrens](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WoW-Classic-Horde-Mage-Solo-AoE-Lvl-12-17-The-Barrens.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WoW-Classic-Horde-Mage-Solo-AoE-Lvl-12-17-The-Barrens.jpg)

* Set hearth at ratchet/crossroads (at ratchet before going to Stonetalon)
* Skip any quests that have too much competition for mob spawns, also I don’t like the [Miner’s Fortune](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/896) quest…mainly because I’m never lucky
* Once you start to run out of quests in the Barrens or they are slightly too high of a level…go to Stonetalon Mountains

### Lvl 16-18 Stonetalon Mountains

Do the easy to complete quests, which are all the quests in the southeast side of Stonetalon, so not in the Charred Veil or anywhere north of Sunrock Retreat and those can you get about 1.5 to 2 levels especially if you kill your way around the zone. Also skip the quest at the top of the waterfall in the Windshear Crag as there is too much travel time.

### Lvl 18-19 The Barrens

* Finish up any quests in northern Barrens and then finish off in Southern Barrens
* If you can make it to 20 here…great, if not, no big deal…just keep hearth in Org if possible but Ratchet/Crossroads works too

### Lvl 19-20 Silverpine Forest

* If you can’t make it to 20 in the Barrens just finish up in Silverpine on the quests to the south
* At 20 train tp to UC, hearth to org, train tp to org, then tp back to UC

### Lvl 20-22 Hillsbrad Foothills

* Do low level quests to get to 22 asap so you can AoE more effectively
* Here is a list of the low level quests that are doable at 20/21:
  + [The Rescue](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/498)
  + [WANTED: Syndicate Personnel](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/549)
  + [Battle of Hillsbrad](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/527) (Part 1)
  + [Elixir of Suffering](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/496) (Part 1)
  + [Elixir of Suffering](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/499) (Part 2)
  + [Elixir of Pain](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/501) (Part 1)
  + [Elixir of Pain](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/502) (Part 2)
  + [Souvenirs of Death](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/546)
* That should get you 2 levels if you are killing your way wherever you go
* You can probably do [Battle of Hillsbrad](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/528) (Part 2) also
