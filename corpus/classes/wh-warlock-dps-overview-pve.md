Viability of Warlocks in WoW Classic PvE Content
------------------------------------------------

Warlocks do not do top tier raid damage till the later stages of Classic WoW. However, at least three warlocks are typically brought to every raid due to the utility they bring with curses, soulstones, healthstones, and crowd controlling effects such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_cripple.gif) Banish](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18647/banish). Warlocks are a viable class to play in early game PvE due to their utility and gain viability later into the game as their DPS starts to quickly ramp up.  
  
Warlocks are typically assigned a specific curse to maintain in each encounter/raid, with the best geared player prioritizing [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_curseofsargeras.gif) Curse of Agony](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11713/curse-of-agony) and sometimes [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_abominationexplosion.gif) Corruption](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25311/corruption) in order to proc [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_twilight.gif) Nightfall](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18095/nightfall), all of which greatly inflate that player's damage relative to other Warlocks in their raid. This creates a large disparity between the top and bottom performers, as they not only benefit from better gear, but also the ability to use more damaging spells.

---

### Best Race for Alliance Warlocks

[![Gnome](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_gnome_male.gif) Gnome](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=7/gnome) is the best Classic WoW Alliance Warlock race for both PvE and PvP.  
  
The primary benefit of raiding on Alliance is being able to raid with Paladins. Paladins have multiple impactful buffs for a Warlock such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_greaterblessingofkings.gif) Greater Blessing of Kings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25898/greater-blessing-of-kings), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterblessingofwisdom.gif) Greater Blessing of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25918/greater-blessing-of-wisdom), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterblessingofsalvation.gif) Greater Blessing of Salvation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25895/greater-blessing-of-salvation). The main attribute that impacts a warlock's damage output gain from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_greaterblessingofkings.gif) Greater Blessing of Kings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25898/greater-blessing-of-kings) is Intellect. 10% more intellect not only increases your chance to receive a critical strike (60 int =1% crit) but also increases the warlock's overall mana pool. Furthermore, since this buff gives a percentage increase, it gains more and more value, the more geared the warlock player gets. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterblessingofwisdom.gif) Greater Blessing of Wisdom](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25918/greater-blessing-of-wisdom) will lower the number of times a warlock will have to cast [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_burningspirit.gif) Life Tap](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11689/life-tap). Not only does this save some healer mana throughout the clearing of a raid, but it also lowers the number of global cooldowns (1.5 seconds) the warlock receives from using [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_burningspirit.gif) Life Tap](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11689/life-tap). Fewer globals spent on life tap means more time to cast damaging spells. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterblessingofsalvation.gif) Greater Blessing of Salvation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25895/greater-blessing-of-salvation) is the most impactful of the paladin buffs for a warlock. Warlocks have no way to reduce threat other than [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_shadowpact.gif) Master Demonologist](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23825/master-demonologist), which sacrifices many impactful talents to obtain.  
  
Moreover, warlocks are capable of producing some of the highest crits in Classic WoW since there are many debuffs to increase shadow damage. For these reasons, threat reduction from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterblessingofsalvation.gif) Greater Blessing of Salvation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25895/greater-blessing-of-salvation) is extremely valuable to a warlock. If a warlock still produces a concerning amount of threat, Paladins have even **MORE** ways to help. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofprotection.gif) Blessing of Protection](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10278/blessing-of-protection) can save a warlock's life when they accidentally over aggro, or can allow a warlock player to play even more aggressively!

### [Gnome Gnome](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=7/gnome) Warlock

Gnomes are hands down the best race in the game for Warlock PvE due to to their ability, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_essenceeternallarge.gif) Expansive Mind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20591/expansive-mind). Although this passive racial ability is not game-breaking, it will affect the warlock at all times in PvE as opposed to other races that have abilities that are situational. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gear_01.gif) Engineering Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20593/engineering-specialization) also makes a minor impact when raiders use engineering pets from trinkets such as [![Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_polymorphchicken.gif) Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10725/gnomish-battle-chicken) and [![Arcanite Dragonling](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_head_dragon_01.gif) Arcanite Dragonling](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16022/arcanite-dragonling). If a gnome takes the time to level their engineering to 315 these two pets will be level 63 when summoned, instead of 60. Not to mention that [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_trip.gif) Escape Artist](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20589/escape-artist) is fantastic in PvP!

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Arcane Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20592/arcane-resistance): Arcane Resistance increased.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_essenceeternallarge.gif) Expansive Mind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20591/expansive-mind): Intelligence increased by 5%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gear_01.gif) Engineering Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20593/engineering-specialization): Engineering skill increased by 15.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_trip.gif) Escape Artist](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20589/escape-artist): Escape the effects of any immobilization or movement speed reduction effect.

### [Human Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) Warlock

[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_shardbrilliantsmall.gif) The Human Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20598/the-human-spirit) is the only racial ability from humans that affects a Warlock in pve. However, the Spirit gained is not significant since warlock gear does not have much, if any spirit at all. Furthermore, many warlocks will be raiding with the "Demon Sacrifice/Ruin" talent build, which has [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_metamorphosis.gif) Demonic Embrace](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18701/demonic-embrace), lowering a warlock's spirit even further. Lastly, humans have [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20600/perception) for PvP, but it does not stack with similar effects such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_detectinvisibility.gif) Detect Greater Invisibility](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11743/detect-greater-invisibility) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_auraofdarkness.gif) Paranoia](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19480/paranoia). Making it not too significant.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_note_02.gif) Diplomacy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20599/diplomacy): Reputation gains increased by 10%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_05.gif) Mace Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20864/mace-specialization): Skill with Maces and Two-Handed Maces increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Perception](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20600/perception): Dramatically increases stealth detection for 20 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_meleedamage.gif) Sword Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20597/sword-specialization): Skill with Swords and Two-Handed Swords increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_enchant_shardbrilliantsmall.gif) The Human Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20598/the-human-spirit): Spirit increased by 5%.

---

### Best Race for Horde Warlocks

[![Undead](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_scourge_male.gif) Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) is marginally better than [![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) as the best Classic WoW Horde Warlock race for PvE, while [![Undead](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_scourge_male.gif) Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) and [![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) are equal in PvP, providing benefits against different matchups.  
  
Warlock players deciding to join the Horde are able to gain benefits that a Shaman player can provide. Shamans are capable of supplying warlocks with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_manaregentotem.gif) Mana Spring Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10497/mana-spring-totem), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_brilliance.gif) Tranquil Air Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25908/tranquil-air-totem), and even [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_summonwaterelemental.gif) Mana Tide Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17359/mana-tide-totem) if the Shaman is specced into it! Unfortunately, warlocks tend to have a disadvantage in PvE on Horde because the totems that a shaman puts down are limited to only buffing the members of the party in which the shaman is placed. Meaning, if there is ever a lack of shamans in the raid group, then shamans will be prioritized towards melee groups over caster groups since [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10613/windfury-totem) makes such a large impact on raid performance. Whenever this happens, warlock players will quickly become threat-capped, limiting their damage output. Luckily both Horde races that can choose warlock as a class have great racial abilities for PvP.

### [Orc Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) Warlock

Orcs do not have many significant abilities for Warlocks in raids. The only racial orcs have that does impact a warlock's gameplay is [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_warcry.gif) Command](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20575/command). However, this racial is only beneficial under certain conditions. First, the warlock would have to be raiding with the "Shadow Mastery/Ruin" talent build since the alternative, "Demonic Sacrifice/Ruin" build opts to sacrifice their pet. Next, the warlock would only be allowed to use their [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_summonimp.gif) Summon Imp](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=688/summon-imp) to DPS on fights where it is able to survive. There are many fights with AoE damaging effects, such as [Vaelastrasz the Corrupt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=13020/vaelastrasz-the-corrupt), where your imp will die if not in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_impphaseshift.gif) Phase Shift](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=4511/phase-shift). Then, if all of those conditions are met, your imp will do 5% more damage. One could argue that [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_23.gif) Hardiness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20573/hardiness) could contribute to raid performance. However, there are very few stunning effects in Classic WoW raids, and the ones that are present can be completely avoided if the warlock player positions themselves correctly. However, Hardiness is incredible in almost all PvP scenarios! Some Rogues despise the stun resistance of orcs so much that they avoid fighting Orc warlocks completely!

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_02.gif) Axe Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20574/axe-specialization) - Skill with Axes and Two-Handed Axes increased by 5.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/racial_orc_berserkerstrength.gif) Blood Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20572/blood-fury) - Increases base melee attack power by 25% for 15 sec and reduces healing effects on you by 50% for 25 sec.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_warcry.gif) Command](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20575/command) - Damage dealt by Hunter and Warlock pets increased by 5%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_23.gif) Hardiness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20573/hardiness) - Chance to resist Stun effects increased by an additional 25%.

### [Undead Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) Warlock

There are two situational racial abilities that benefit Undead Warlocks in a raid. These two abilities are [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_raisedead.gif) Will of the Forsaken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=7744/will-of-the-forsaken) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_detectinvisibility.gif) Shadow Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20579/shadow-resistance). Let's start by discussing the benefits of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_raisedead.gif) Will of the Forsaken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=7744/will-of-the-forsaken). There are multiple boss encounters in Classic WoW that have AoE-fearing effects. Some can be avoided without any DPS loss, and some are very difficult to avoid without losing DPS. During these encounters, Undead warlocks can use their Will of the Forsaken to completely avoid one fear, allowing the undead warlock to continue to DPS for 4+seconds (depending on the encounter) while Orc warlocks will be stuck in fearing effects. The faster that these sorts of bosses are defeated, the more of an impact Will of the Forsaken will have on the DPS meters. Will of the Forsaken is also instrumental in PvP, allowing Undead warlocks to have an extreme advantage versus any Warlock of another race! [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_detectinvisibility.gif) Shadow Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20579/shadow-resistance), while only minimally, helps warlocks reduce shadow damage taken from some bosses that can cast damaging shadow abilities. The most common of these examples would be using a warlock to tank [Emperor Vek'lor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15276/emperor-veklor).

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_cannibalize.gif) Cannibalize](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20577/cannibalize): When activated, regenerates 7% of total health every 2 sec for 10 sec. Only works on Humanoid or Undead corpses within 5 yds. Any movement, action, or damage taken while Cannibalizing will cancel the effect.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_detectinvisibility.gif) Shadow Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20579/shadow-resistance): Shadow Resistance increased by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_demonbreath.gif) Underwater Breathing](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=5227/underwater-breathing): Underwater breath lasts 300% longer than normal.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_raisedead.gif) Will of the Forsaken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=7744/will-of-the-forsaken): Provides immunity to Charm, Fear and Sleep while active. May also be used while already afflicted by Charm, Fear or Sleep. Lasts 5 sec.

WoW Classic Warlock DPS Specializations
---------------------------------------

Classes in Classic WoW will earn a total of 51 talent points, allowing them to take talents from multiple trees, though most builds typically invest the majority of their points in one tree, while taking only select bonuses in the others. Warlocks are a somewhat special case in that they frequently skip the bottom-most talents in order to better hybridize among all three talent trees, though several viable talent combinations still exist, depending on whether the player is interested in PvE or PvP.   
  
Â **Affliction:** A master of shadow magic who specializes in drains and damage-over-time spells.

* [Shadow Mastery/Ruin builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/warlock/dps-talent-builds-pve#shadow-mastery-ruin-30-0-21) bring utility, multiple DoTs and, use a pet while raiding, often to increase the health of group tanks. A [similar build](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/warlock/dps-talent-builds-pve#shadow-mastery-ruin-pvp-30-0-21) exists for PvP which sacrifices tankiness for better sustain and damage potential.

Â **Demonology:** A master of demons who compels demonic powers to aid them.

* [Master Demonologist builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/warlock/dps-talent-builds-pve#master-demonologist-ruin-0-30-21) are useful for raiding Warlocks who find themselves continually needing to stop DPS in order to manage their threat, allowing them to deal more damage than they otherwise would if their tank was unable to keep up. It also forgoes sacrificing their pet for damage, allowing it to benefit the party instead. Ideally, you should never have to resort to this build.

Â **Destruction:** A master of chaos who calls down fire to turn and demolish enemies.

* [Conflagrate builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/warlock/dps-talent-builds-pve#conflagrate-19-1-31) are the most fragile, but highest damage potential PvP builds, able to burst full health players to dust in a matter of seconds, excelling in duels and other 1v1 situations, though susceptible to being ganged up on and taken down easily in team fights.

Â **Hybrid**: As stated, Warlocks are a special case in that they frequently abstain from using the 31 point talent in any particular tree, instead of spreading their points more evenly.

* The [Demonic Sacrifice build](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/warlock/dps-talent-builds-pve#demonic-sacrifice-ruin-9-21-21) is the strongest single target spec (if no movement is involved), revolving around sacrificing their Succubus pet in order to deal 15% more shadow damage. It has several drawbacks, however precluding the use of a pet, which can be an important buff for raid tanks, and less cleave damage compared to the SM Ruin build.

### Best Warlock Spec for PvE in WoW Classic

Affliction is the best Warlock spec for early Classic WoW, as players will use a Shadow Mastery / Ruin (30/0/21) for maximum performance. It has the benefit of being well-performing in solo content, cleave damage, fights with forced movement, and holds its own in PvP.  
  
A more-uncommon Warlock spec is Demonology, running a Demonic Sacrifice / Ruin (9/21/21) build. This spec used to be the best performing with limited access to debuff slots. This is no longer the case. DS Ruin still provides the highest single target DPS as long as there is no forced movement, this is also known as a "Patchwork style" fight. They can also provide different ranks of [![Major Healthstone](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_stone_04.gif) Major Healthstone](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19013/major-healthstone) thanks to their talents.

Best Professions for Classic Warlocks
-------------------------------------

No matter the class you choose to play, you can go with any professions you'd like. However, some professions give you slight edges over others. The professions PvE Warlocks want are [![Engineering](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=202/engineering) and [![Tailoring](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Tailoring](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=197/tailoring).

### [Tailoring](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/tailoring-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

There are a few items from different phases of content that are best in slot but require Tailoring.**Phase 1:**[![Robe of the Void](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_cloth_51.gif) Robe of the Void](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14153/robe-of-the-void), crafted from [![Pattern: Robe of the Void](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_scroll_03.gif) Pattern: Robe of the Void](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14514/pattern-robe-of-the-void)(an extremely rare drop from [Darkmaster Gandling](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=1853/darkmaster-gandling)), is the best in slot chest piece until the warlock player either receives [![Robe of Volatile Power](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_cloth_18.gif) Robe of Volatile Power](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19145/robe-of-volatile-power) that drops in Molten Core or [![Bloodvine Vest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_cloth_07.gif) Bloodvine Vest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19682/bloodvine-vest) in phase 4. Robe of the Void cannot be crafted unless the player has 300/300 tailoring. It is important to note that while this chest piece is technically best in slot, [![Robe of Winter Night](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_cloth_49.gif) Robe of Winter Night](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14136/robe-of-winter-night) is not far behind it in terms of DPS gain. Also, Robe of Winter Night does not require the warlock to roll tailoring since it is bind on equip and will save the warlock player a lot of gold!**Phase 4:**Â [Bloodvine Garb](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=421/bloodvine-garb), consisting of the three items [![Bloodvine Leggings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_cloth_14.gif) Bloodvine Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19683/bloodvine-leggings)Â [![Bloodvine Vest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_cloth_07.gif) Bloodvine Vest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19682/bloodvine-vest) and [![Bloodvine Boots](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_cloth_02.gif) Bloodvine Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19684/bloodvine-boots), do not technically require the warlock to have tailoring to acquire like [![Robe of the Void](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_cloth_51.gif) Robe of the Void](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14153/robe-of-the-void) does since each of the Bloodvine items are bind on equip. Even so, warlock players will still want to have 300 Tailoring when wearing this set. The set-bonus, 2% spell critical strike chance, will only be activated if the player wearing the items has 300 Tailoring and 2% spell critical strike chance is **NOT** something warlock players will want to miss out on!

### [Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

Engineering improves performance in three different ways. It improves damage output, gives access to gear, and grants access to various useful trinkets!As for damage output, the primary item used would be the notorious [![Goblin Sapper Charge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Sapper Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge). This explosive has no cast time and has no maximum number of targets it can hit. If the player has a well-timed sapper charge during AoE encounters, they can instantly jump up the damage meters! The downside to this explosive is that not only does it hurt the user when cast, but also requires the player to be in near-melee range of any enemies they wish to hit. If there are AoE scenarios that are too threatening for the warlock to get too close to, he/she can opt to use a [![Dense Dynamite](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_06.gif) Dense Dynamite](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18641/dense-dynamite).Early into the game in Phase 1 of content warlocks with engineering can use [![Green Lens](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_44.gif) Green Lens](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10504/green-lens) of Shadow Wrath for +36 shadow damage, which is one of the best pre-raid helmets. Later into the game when [Zul'Gurub](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=1977/zulgurub) is released in Phase 4 comes access to another Bloodvine item, [![Bloodvine Goggles](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_47.gif) Bloodvine Goggles](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19999/bloodvine-goggles). This helmet is an amazing pre-raid helmet if the player does not already have the rank 10 PvP set 2-piece bonus (helmet + shoulders).Although there are several pets available to the player through engineering warlocks are primarily concerned with getting [![Arcanite Dragonling](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_head_dragon_01.gif) Arcanite Dragonling](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16022/arcanite-dragonling) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_polymorphchicken.gif) Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12906/gnomish-battle-chicken). [![Arcanite Dragonling](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_head_dragon_01.gif) Arcanite Dragonling](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16022/arcanite-dragonling) is useful once reaching [Ahn'Qiraj](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3428/ahnqiraj) and [Naxxramas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3456/naxxramas) once Mages are able to use their fire talent build. Players summon arcanite dragonling against bosses because of the debuff it applies, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_fireball.gif) Flame Buffet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16168/flame-buffet). If your arcanite dragonling is on cooldown or your guild is raiding [Molten Core](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2717/molten-core) and [Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair), warlocks can be swapped into melee heavy groups to use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_polymorphchicken.gif) Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12906/gnomish-battle-chicken). This little chicken has a chance to cast the buff [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_birdbeck_01.gif) Battle Squawk](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23060/battle-squawk) for all of the melees in the group! It is also important to note that both of these pet trinkets can be used before engaging any boss and swapped over to another DPS trinket. Swapping the pet trinket away will not make the pet disappear! Warlock's who opt to tank [Emperor Vek'lor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15276/emperor-veklor) will want to get two [![Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_16.gif) Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18639/ultra-flash-shadow-reflector) since they are the best shadow resistance trinkets available when heading into [Ahn'Qiraj](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3428/ahnqiraj).
