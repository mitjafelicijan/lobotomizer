*"The druid is a formidable class with good healing ability, potent offensive spells, excellent buffs, and the unique ability to shapeshift into different animal types. In its animal forms, the druid can adopt new roles, such as that of a warrior or rogue, giving it great versatility."* -- World of Warcraft Game Manual, 2004

Druids are the jack of all trades class, able to perform the roles of healing, tanking, melee DPS, or caster DPS. In Classic WoW, Druids are likely to fill the role of a healer, while occasionally being an off-tank, and rarely being used as a DPS. The most unique aspect of the Druid class is the ability to shapeshift into forms such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_bearform.gif) Bear Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=5487/bear-form), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_forceofnature.gif) Moonkin Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24858/moonkin-form), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_aquaticform.gif) Aquatic Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1066/aquatic-form), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_travelform.gif) Travel Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=783/travel-form), allowing access to different abilities and resources for each. They are the only class other than Rogues that have the ability to stealth with the use of [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Prowl](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9913/prowl), and one of the only classes to provide a resurrection during combat with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_reincarnation.gif) Rebirth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20748/rebirth).

Viability of Restoration Druid Healers in WoW Classic Fresh PvE Content
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Druids are a great all-around class, being able to perform all roles. While they do not top the meters normally, they do offer incredible utility. Raids will look to bring 1-3 healing Druids. Heal-over-time effects such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_rejuvenation.gif) Rejuvenation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25299/rejuvenation) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_resistnature.gif) Regrowth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9858/regrowth) do not stack from multiple Druids on a single target.   
  
Healing on a Druid is the most viable option as Feral tanking has only very niche uses, and Feral DPS or Balance DPS isn't considered great.

---

Strengths of Classic Restoration Druid Healers
----------------------------------------------

* **Druids can resurrect in combat.** They are the only class with the ability to bring a player to back to life during a fight, making them essential to any raid. Warlocks are similar but have to cast their Soulstone preemptively.
* **Hybrid talent choices are viable.** Unlike most other classes, Druids can branch into multiple talent trees and still remain viable. Since talent respecs can be costly, this makes it easier to play multiple roles in PvP or PvE without having to change talents.
* **Druids have tons of utility.** [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_regeneration.gif) Mark of the Wild](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9885/mark-of-the-wild), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_lightning.gif) Innervate](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=29166/innervate), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_faeriefire.gif) Faerie Fire](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9907/faerie-fire), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_nullifypoison_02.gif) Abolish Poison](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2893/abolish-poison), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_removecurse.gif) Remove Curse](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2782/remove-curse), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_reincarnation.gif) Rebirth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20748/rebirth) are just some of the numerous abilities that Druids bring to any fight, making them very intricate and engaging.

Weaknesses of Classic Restoration Druid Healers
-----------------------------------------------

* **Druids do not have a “normal” resurrection ability.** Paladin, Priest, and Shaman all have an out of combat resurrection ability, but Druids do not. This can mean frequent corpse-runs for your group.
* **Don’t expect to top the charts.** If you’re looking to be the best of any role, look elsewhere. Druids are most effective as hybrids, jumping in and out of forms as needed.

Factions & Races
----------------

Only two races in WoW Classic can be Druids: [![Night Elf](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_nightelf_male.gif) Night Elf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=4/night-elf) for the Alliance and [![Tauren](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_tauren_male.gif) Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren) for the Horde. Therefore, you do not have any options when choosing what Druid race is best for PvE or PvP once you have picked a faction to play.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Race** | [Druid Druid](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=11/druid) | [Hunter Hunter](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=3/hunter) | [Mage Mage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=8/mage) | [Paladin Paladin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=2/paladin) | [Priest Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) | [Rogue Rogue](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=4/rogue) | [Shaman Shaman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=7/shaman) | [Warlock Warlock](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=9/warlock) | [Warrior Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) |
| [Dwarf Dwarf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=3/dwarf) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Gnome Gnome](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=7/gnome) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Human Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Night Elf Night Elf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=4/night-elf) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Orc Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Tauren Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Troll Troll](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=8/troll) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [Undead Undead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=5/undead) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Since Classic WoW is so strongly community-based, it is recommended that you pick whichever faction your friends, family, or guild chooses as the differences between the races are quite small.

### Alliance Druids

Alliance Druids have the benefit of playing alongside a Paladin, which can buff the Druid with powerful Blessings such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_fistofjustice.gif) Blessing of Might](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25291/blessing-of-might) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_magearmor.gif) Blessing of Kings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20217/blessing-of-kings). Paladins can also give useful Auras such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_devotionaura.gif) Devotion Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=465/devotion-aura), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_sealoffire.gif) Fire Resistance Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19891/fire-resistance-aura), or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_mindsooth.gif) Concentration Aura](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19746/concentration-aura), which can be helpful for casting healing or damage spells.

#### [Night Elf Night Elf](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=4/night-elf) Druids

Night Elves draw a lot of attention due to their overall appearance, but they also have a slightly larger mana pool. While [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Shadowmeld](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20580/shadowmeld) can only be used out of combat, this ability comes in handy during PvP situations as it allows the player time undetected to drink and restore mana. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Wisp Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20585/wisp-spirit) may not affect combat, but it does significantly reduce the time it takes to corpse-run, making it an excellent passive racial during leveling. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_shadowmeld.gif) Quickness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20582/quickness) is stronger for melee combat, especially tanking, and will have little use to a healing Druid. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritarmor.gif) Nature Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20583/nature-resistance) can be quite useful when facing Horde Shaman in PvP.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritarmor.gif) Nature Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20583/nature-resistance): Nature Resistance increased by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_wispsplode.gif) Wisp Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20585/wisp-spirit): Transform into a wisp upon death, increasing movement speed by 50%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_shadowmeld.gif) Quickness](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20582/quickness): Dodge chance increased by 1%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Shadowmeld](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20580/shadowmeld): Activate to slip into the shadows, reducing the chance for enemies to detect your presence. Lasts until cancelled or upon moving. Night Elf Rogues and Druids with Shadowmeld are more difficult to detect while stealthed or prowling.

---

### Horde Druids

Horde Druids have the benefit of playing alongside a Shaman, which has access to [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=27621/windfury-totem). [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_windfury.gif) Windfury Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=27621/windfury-totem) only affects melee attacks and does not work while in shapeshift forms, making this interaction not very useful, especially to healing Druids. However, Shamans also bring a multitude of other useful totems, such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_tremortotem.gif) Tremor Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=8143/tremor-totem), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_stoneskintotem.gif) Stoneskin Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10408/stoneskin-totem), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_frost_summonwaterelemental.gif) Mana Tide Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17359/mana-tide-totem), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_manaregentotem.gif) Mana Spring Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=10497/mana-spring-totem).

#### [Tauren Tauren](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=6/tauren) Druid

Taurens have an increased hitbox as well as extra reach on melee attacks. This makes them a solid choice for PvP, combined with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warstomp.gif) War Stomp](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20549/war-stomp). [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_flower_01.gif) Cultivation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20552/cultivation) comes in handy as Herbalism is a good profession for Druids. While both Druid races have [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritarmor.gif) Nature Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20551/nature-resistance), it’s slightly less useful for Tauren in PvP since there aren’t Alliance Shaman in Classic. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Endurance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20550/endurance) is great for all roles and forms. These abilities have minimal effect on PvE.

#### Racial Bonuses

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_flower_01.gif) Cultivation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20552/cultivation): Herbalism skill increased by 15.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_unyeildingstamina.gif) Endurance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20550/endurance): Total Health increased by 5%.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_spiritarmor.gif) Nature Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20551/nature-resistance): Nature Resistance increased by 10.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warstomp.gif) War Stomp](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20549/war-stomp): Stuns up to 5 enemies within 8 yds for 2 sec.

WoW Classic Restoration Druid Healer Specializations
----------------------------------------------------

There are three specialization talent trees for Classic Druids: Balance (ranged spell DPS), Feral Combat (melee tank and DPS), and Restoration (healing). Restoration Druid Healers will spend most of their points in the Restoration tree, with some support talents in the Balance and Feral Combat trees depending on the situation.  
  
Classes in Classic WoW will earn a total of 51 talent points, allowing them to take talents from multiple trees, though most builds typically invest the majority of their points in one tree, while taking only select bonuses in the others. Druid talents are versatile, providing several benefits for other trees, encouraging cross-specializing, and there are several viable talent combinations, depending on whether the player is interested in PvE or PvP.   
  
 **Balance:** Druids can take on the form of a wild moonkin to blast enemies from afar.

* [Moonglow builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/healer-talent-builds-pve#moonglow) hybridize Balance and Restoration in order to provide mana efficiency, but can also deal moderate damage from range as well, however Balance Druids are not seen as overly competitive in Classic, as they are very mana intensive.

 **Feral:** Druids can take on the form of a durable bear or savage cat in order to claw and bite their enemies up close.

* [Feral Combat builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/feral/dps-talent-builds-pve#standard-feral-cat-dps) specialize in utilizing Cat Form for dealing damage, while also lowering the armor of their targets and increasing the critical strike chance of their group members. It is typically the go-to leveling spec, due to the increased damage and movement speed, as well as many of the talents benefitting tanking.

 **Bear:** Feral Druids specializing in tanking

* [Feral Tank builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/feral/tank-talent-builds-pve#dedicated-bear-tank) trade damage potential for increased mitigation, while still providing the same utility in reducing their targets armor and increasing their group members critical strike chance. A slightly tweaked [hybridized damage oriented build](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/feral/tank-talent-builds-pve#bear-tank-with-cat-hybrid-talents) also exists for dedicated off-tanks who spend more time in Cat Form.

 **Restoration:** By calling upon the powers of nature, druids are able to swiftly restore health to their injured allies.

* [Swiftmend builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/healer-talent-builds-pve#swiftmend) are often dedicated tank healers, specializing in consuming healing over time effects for a large burst of healing. [Moonglow builds](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/healer-talent-builds-pve#moonglow) are more mana efficient, making them stronger for early raiding.

### Best Builds for Druid Healers

All healing Druids will put a sizable amount of points into the Restoration talent tree for Classic raiding, such as the Swiftmend 15/0/36 build. You may go deep into other trees to pick up talents like [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_blessingofagility.gif) Heart of the Wild](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17003/heart-of-the-wild), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_faeriefire.gif) Faerie Fire (Feral)](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=17392/faerie-fire-feral), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_naturesblessing.gif) Nature's Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16880/natures-grace), or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sentinal.gif) Moonglow](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16847/moonglow).  
  
Viable end-game PvE builds are covered in our [Classic Restoration Druid Healer Talents & Builds Guide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/druid/healer-talent-builds-pve).

Best Professions for Classic Restoration Druid Healers
------------------------------------------------------

The great thing about playing a healing Druid is that there aren’t many pieces of gear that require a specific profession to use, making any profession viable. Typically, Druids will choose Herbalism and Engineering, or Herbalism with Alchemy. Another option is to pick Herbalism and Skinning while leveling to get some extra gold, and then swap Skinning out for another profession at level 60.

### [Herbalism](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/herbalism-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

[![Herbalism](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Herbalism](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=182/herbalism) is a lucrative profession and needed to provide materials for alchemists in order to supply a raid team with consumables. Since other classes are forced into professions to optimize their gear, Druids tend to pick up [![Herbalism](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Herbalism](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=182/herbalism) simply to help out the guild. As an added perk, Druids can pick herbs while in shapeshift forms such as [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_travelform.gif) Travel Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=783/travel-form).

### [Alchemy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/alchemy-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

[![Alchemy](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Alchemy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=171/alchemy) pairs well with [![Herbalism](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Herbalism](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=182/herbalism) and since Druids aren’t tied to a specific profession like other classes, they can easily pick up [![Alchemy](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Alchemy](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=171/alchemy) to help out with crafting consumables for the raid.

### [Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic)

[Engineering](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/engineering-leveling-1-300-wow-classic) is most commonly picked as a profession in Classic due to its wide variety of powerful items such as [![Iron Grenade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bomb_08.gif) Iron Grenade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=4390/iron-grenade), [![Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_49.gif) Goblin Rocket Helmet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10588/goblin-rocket-helmet), [![Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_polymorphchicken.gif) Gnomish Battle Chicken](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10725/gnomish-battle-chicken), and [![Goblin Sapper Charge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_selfdestruct.gif) Goblin Sapper Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge). If you're trying to min/max your performance in both PvP and PvE, you'll likely need to pick up this profession.

---

Druid Shapeshifting
-------------------

Shapeshifting is the most fun and iconic aspect of being a Druid in both PvE and PvP. While in form, the Druid is immune to polymorph effects. Shapeshifting in or out of forms also frees the Druid from movement impairing effects such as slows, roots, and snares.

* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_bearform.gif) Bear Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=5487/bear-form) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_bearform.gif) Dire Bear Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9634/dire-bear-form) allow the Druid to take on the role of tanking with increased health and armor from items. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_bearform.gif) Bear Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=5487/bear-form) is used a lot during leveling, but is acquired via a questline and not the class trainer.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form) allows the Druid to deal Melee DPS using energy and combo points in a way similar to a Rogue. Druids in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form) can also use [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ambush.gif) Prowl](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9913/prowl).
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_forceofnature.gif) Moonkin Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=24858/moonkin-form) is acquired deep into the Balance talent tree and provides the Druid with increased armor and everyone in the party with 3% Spell Critical Strike Chance. While in this form, the Druid can only use Balance spells.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_travelform.gif) Travel Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=783/travel-form) increases movement speed by 40%. This is especially important since this form is learned at level 30, ten levels before being able to buy a mount. [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_travelform.gif) Travel Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=783/travel-form) is excellent for PvP as it allows the Druid to outrun an opponent or more easily carry flags.
* [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_aquaticform.gif) Aquatic Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1066/aquatic-form) can only be used in water, increases swim speed by 50%, and allows underwater breathing. This form is learned through a questline and not the class trainer.
