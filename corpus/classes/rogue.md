Rogues are WoW Classic’s masters of intrigue, utilizing their stealth, poisons, and agility to evade, assassinate, and steal. They are often thought of as the ultimate PvP class, and they are in high demand for raids as well, with their damage output rivaling even that of Warriors.

Rogues are able to [Pick Lock](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1804)s and [Pick Pocket](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/921)s, which offer some interesting approaches to farming that aren’t available to other classes. [Evasion](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5277), [Sprint](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2983), [Stealth](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1785), and [Vanish](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1856) make them extremely slippery opponents in both PvP and PvE, and their crowd control arsenal is unparalleled with [Blind](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2094), [Cheap Shot](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/6409), [Gouge](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1777), [Kidney Shot](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/408), [Kick](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1766), and [Sap](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/6770) allowing them to keep enemies incapacitated almost indefinitely.

Roles and Specializations
-------------------------

The three talent trees for Rogues are **Assassination**, **Combat**, and **Subtlety**.

* **Assassination**
  + Focuses on improving poison damage and critical strikes.
  + Played less than Combat due to requiring a lot of critical strike rating to be competitive.
* **Combat**
  + Offers buffs to survivability and physical damage.
  + The most common choice for raiding, with its strong damage output.
* **Subtlety**
  + Provides improvements to stealth and utility.
  + Subtlety is an exceptional tree for PvP and solo play, but is not as viable in raids.

View the complete Rogue talent tree in our [Rogue Talent Calculator](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/tools/talent-calculator/rogue).

Class Feature: Stealth
----------------------

[Stealth](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1785) is a core mechanic of the Rogue class which is required for some of their abilities. They are able to sneak their way through enemy-infested areas to reach their objective, which can be especially useful for solo play and farming. While Druids are also able to stealth, Rogues are the only class who can [Vanish](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1856) once they have already engaged in combat, offering the ultimate escape when a situation goes bad.

Class Feature: Poisons
----------------------

Rogues utilize a variety of poisons on their weapons which grant them some unique, useful buffs. These poisons can be crafted by the Rogue or purchased from Poison Vendors found in cities and many quest hubs.

Class Feature: Lockpicking
--------------------------

Rogues are the only class that is capable of opening locked boxes, chests, and doors thanks to their [Lockpicking](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/lockpicking-1-300/) skill. Some doors in the game require a key, but otherwise a Rogue with the appropriate skill can open anything in the game. The only other way to open locked chests and lockboxes is with expensive crafted consumable items. Many Rogues offer up their services in opening locked boxes as a way of earning some extra gold.

Resources
---------

Rogues use **Energy** as their main ability resource. They also accumulate and spend **Combo Points**.

Races
-----

Rogues have several [Race](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/race/) options for each faction.

#### Luxrah

I've been playing World of Warcraft on and off since vanilla, usually as a healer or caster and often as a guild leader. I play both retail and classic. I also love RPGs, sandboxes, and sims.
