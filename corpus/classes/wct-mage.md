Mages are the ultimate utility class in WoW Classic, between their portals, conjured food and water, mobility, and crowd control. Their ability to control and damage many mobs at once makes them one of the best classes for farming in both dungeons and the open world. The Mage is also a gold printing machine, able to sell portals and conjured water without even leaving their capital city. On top of all this, their strong DPS makes them highly desirable in raids.

With [Blink](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1953), [Slow Fall](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/130), and the ability to teleport themselves and their party members to any major city on demand, Mages have a strong advantage in Vanilla World of Warcraft where simply getting from point A to point B is half the work. They also bring [Counterspell](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2139) and [Remove Lesser Curse](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/475) as well as the valuable [Arcane Intellect](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1460) buff to further cement their desirability in group content.

Roles and Specializations
-------------------------

The three talent trees for Mages are **Arcane**, **Fire**, and **Frost**.

* **Arcane**
  + Contains talents to improve the Mage’s mana utility and effectiveness with Arcane spells.
  + The least popular specialization for Mages in WoW Classic due to the other two offering more damage and control.
* **Fire**
  + Buffs the Mage’s damage with their Fire spells.
  + This specialization offers the highest potential DPS, but is often avoided in early phases due to the Fire resistance of enemies in the Molten Core and Blackwing Lair raids.
* **Frost**
  + Improves the Mage’s damage with their Frost spells and provides additional survivability and utility.
  + This specialization is optimal for solo and PvP content due to its high AoE damage output as well as control and survival talents.
  + Often used in early phase raids where Fire resistance is high.

Class Feature: Portals
----------------------

Mages are able to create Portals to each of their faction’s three major cities. Other players in their group can use these Portals to teleport to that location, saving them the trouble of having to get back there on foot or using a [Hearthstone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6948). Mages will often sell Portals to other players as a way of making extra gold. At the end of a raid, a Mage will usually put up a Portal to their faction’s capital city for everyone to use.

Mages can also Teleport themselves in the same way. There is no cooldown on these abilities, so a Mage can very easily run back and forth between distant locations that would otherwise require quite a lot of travel time.

Class Feature: Conjured Food and Water
--------------------------------------

In addition to Portals, Mages can also conjure up food and water for themselves and their allies to use. These consumables are equivalent to the standard food and water that can be purchased from vendors, but come at no cost. Conjured items disappear once a character has been logged out for 15 minutes, but there is no limit on how much of it a Mage can make (other than the mana required to conjure it or the bag space needed to store it).

Resources
---------

Mages use **Mana** as their main ability resource.

Races
-----

Mages have a few [Race](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/race/) options for each faction.

I've been playing World of Warcraft on and off since vanilla, usually as a healer or caster and often as a guild leader. I play both retail and classic. I also love RPGs, sandboxes, and sims.
