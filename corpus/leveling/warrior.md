Welcome to our WoW Classic leveling guide for warriors! The tough and mighty warrior certainly makes for one of the strongest late-game classes for damage *or* tanking, but it balances out with a fairly weak leveling experience. If you’re feeling frustrated trying to level a warrior, have faith that it *does* get better, and that all your suffering is forging you into a smarter, better warrior player!

Leveling a warrior is fairly different from playing a max-level warrior. For starters, you’ll use a completely different talent specialization and your stat priorities are quite wonky. As a max-level warrior, your primary focus is dealing damage, but you also need to keep an eye on your health, survivability, and overall well being when you’re leveling.

To keep up with the challenge a warrior demands, there are several important things you want to know! This guide will cover some generalized leveling tips, but we’ll also go in depth on how you want to progress as a warrior, including your talent path, ability training schedule, class quests, and even how you should prioritize stats! We’ll also give you some helpful tips and tricks to make the leveling process just a little bit easier!

#### Pros & Cons

**Pros**

* Piloting this class with finesse is like art!
* An engaging, challenging class with a high skill cap.
* Great mobility with both [*Charge*](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11578) and [*Intercept*](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20617).
* One of the best damage-dealers with late-game gear.
* You can use any weapon except wands and have a lot of flexibility in weapon progression.
* Great at serving as a tank and absorbing damage for allies.
* You look absolutely *awesome*.

**Cons**

* *Very* difficult to level solo.
* Terrible self-healing and regeneration.
* Extremely weapon-dependent.
* Confusing playstyle due to awkward stances and weapon swapping.

General Leveling Tips
---------------------

No matter what class you want to play, there are some best practices you can follow to make the experience more enjoyable and quicker overall. Leveling in WoW Classic is all about the journey and gradual progression of your character. If you’re not having a fun time on your way to level 60, then you’ll view leveling as a chore. This begins with ensuring you’re picking the right class that suits your personality and desired playstyle, so make sure a close-and-comfy warrior is the right class for you.

On top of making sure you enjoy every moment you spend in Azeroth, you’ll also want to:

* Don’t be afraid to research quests online that you get stuck on, but try to explore and figure it out for yourself first!
* Make sure you always have **plenty** of food and bandages. Especially as a warrior, you’ll spend a lot of time sitting down and eating after fights. If you run out of food, you’re going to have a bad time because it’ll take literal minutes for your health to regenerate.
* Try to group up whenever possible. With more people around for enemies to smack, you’ll take less damage yourself, giving you more time to slay your foes. Leveling alone is *extremely* challenging, so this can also make your experience better.
* Stick to zones that you’re familiar with and/or have closely-grouped quest hubs. If you already know a zone fairly well, you’ll have a much easier time understanding where to go to complete quest objectives. Closely-grouped quest hubs just make the leveling process much smoother, giving you more experience while requiring you to move around less.
* Ideally you should only be fighting mobs that are equal level, or 1-2 levels below your level.

Warrior Specific Gameplay Advice
--------------------------------

* Get comfortable with using [Hamstring](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7373)! At low levels in particular, you have quite a slow weapon attack speed and will frequently have periods where you won’t be using any abilities and are waiting for your auto attack to come back up. During these periods, you can actually use [Hamstring](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7373) and run away until your auto attack is ready. This will slow your target, which will allow you to get far enough away that they can’t attack you. It may seem tedious, but it can significantly reduce the amount of damage you take, which in turn reduces your down time!
* Until level 38 when you learn [Pummel](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/6554), your only interrupt is [Shield Bash](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1672). This requires you to use a shield and be in either [Battle Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7165), or [Defensive Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/71). It’s probably your most useful ability to use against casters, just make sure you have a shield of some kind on you before engaging with one.
* If you really get yourself into a pickle, you can use [Retaliation](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20230) if you feel confident in turning the battle around and killing your foes. Alternatively, [Intimidating Shout](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5246) will cause enemies to run in fear, giving you a chance to escape.
* Learn how and when to switch stances! Changing stances will offer you access to additional abilities, but it resets your global cooldown and drastically reduces your overall rage (to just 25 with 5 points in Tactical Mastery). This means they’re best used when you really need them and don’t have any other abilities to use in [Battle Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7165).
* Sometimes you’ll need to switch your weapons. Abilities like [Shield Bash](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1672) require you to use a shield, meaning you’ll need to put one on quickly. Unfortunately, switching weapons resets your auto attack swing timer, so try to switch weapons immediately after landing an auto attack. Don’t forget to switch back when you’re done!

### Rotation

Your rotation is going to change depending upon what level you are, as several key abilities require you to reach certain levels to train them. With that in mind, simply drop whatever abilities you don’t have yet from the rotation, but add them in when you’re high enough level to use them.

Your top priority will always be to keep [Battle Shout](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/25289) applied for the attack power bonus. On single targets, if your target is at 20% or lower health, you’ll want to prioritize [Execute](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5308) for the biggest damage. If your target is above 20% health, then your priority becomes to use [Overpower](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7384) upon dodging an attack.

[Overpower](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7384) does require you to dodge though, which does make it unreliable to fit into your rotation. Use it whenever it is available, otherwise use [Mortal Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12294) on cooldown. If [Execute](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5308) and [Overpower](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7384) are both unavailable and [Mortal Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12294) is on cooldown, you can cast [Whirlwind](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1680). After that, spend any excess rage on [Heroic Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/78).

Your rotation becomes a little different with multiple targets. Instead of using [Execute](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5308) right away, you’ll cast [Sweeping Strikes](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12292) for your abilities to hit an additional enemy. Then you’ll actually use [Whirlwind](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1680) right after, followed up by [Execute](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5308) if your target is low enough.

If both abilities are unavailable, use [Overpower](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7384) if you’ve dodged an attack. In the event you don’t dodge, you’ll then use [Mortal Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12294) instead. If you have any spare rage at this point, you can dump it all into [Heroic Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/78).

To simplify:

* **Single Target**: [Battle Shout](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/25289) (keep applied) > [Execute](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5308) >  [Overpower](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7384) > [Mortal Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12294) > [Whirlwind](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1680) > [Heroic Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/78)
* **Multiple Targets**: [Battle Shout](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/25289) (keep applied) > [Sweeping Strikes](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12292) > [Whirlwind](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1680) > [Execute](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5308) >  [Overpower](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7384) > [Mortal Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12294) > [Heroic Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/78)

#### Rotation by Level

Levels 1-10

* If you are ever at 100% health you are likely misplaying. Push the limits of your combat efficiency!
* Train [First Aid](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/first-aid-1-300/) + [Skinning](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/skinning-1-300/) ASAP
* Use whatever weapon has the highest DPS regardless of type (polearm, staff, 1h etc.)
* Save every single copper, you will need money for weapon upgrades. Buy white weapons from the vendors as your money permits.
* Initiate with [Charge](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/100) ideally, but sometimes you will have to face pull as [Charge](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/100) will be a liability.
* Tab target [Rend](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/772) if you are fighting multiple mobs. Use [Thunderclap](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8147) if you are fighting 2+ mobs and only if they have high attack speed.
* Do the [Defensive Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/71) class quest.

Levels 11-20

* It’s most efficient at this stage to kill single targets as opposed to killing multiple at the same time.
* Keep a 1H + Shield on you starting at level 12 when you get [Shield Bash](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/72).
* Make sure you buy new food every 5 levels.
* Skip [Mocking Blow](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/694) and as much as possible in the Protection tree. Only train Rank 1 of [Thunderclap](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8147), [Cleave](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/845), [Overpower](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7384), [Shield Bash](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/72), (damage increase / effect is negligible).

Levels 21-40

* As soon as you have [Blood Craze](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/16487) at 21 you can start practicing sitting mid combat with a **/sit** macro which will make the mob crit you 100% of the time. This will proc [Blood Craze](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/16487) and eventually [Enrage](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12317) at level 25.
* You need to start integrating your **/sit** into your Hamstring Method. This is quite APM intensive but 100% worth it. Once you master this technique you will have a 25% damage boost with nearly 100% uptime.
* At 30 do your [Berserker Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2458) quest and use the Hamstring Method to easily kite around and kill Big Will.
* If 30+ you have a support structure such as a guild, do your [Whirlwind Axe](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6975) quest ASAP.

### Why is a Swing Timer Important?

Before you get started leveling it is of *vital* importance that you download and setup a swing timer.

A swing timer addon measures the time between your weapon swings. It is useful to know this information so you can use abilities and move freely without clipping into your natural auto attack cycle and consequently losing damage. It is extremely important to have this addon as we will be using the Hamstring Method to level to 60.

While the bar is loading to full it means you can move freely, you are not wasting any damage. As it starts to fill back up this signals that your auto attack cooldown has almost reset and you should position yourself to swing again.

### Stat Priority

1. **Strength**
   * Your best stat by far. Strength directly increases your Attack Power, which means your attacks deal more damage! Hitting harder lets you kill enemies faster and gives you less downtime overall.
   * Increases Attack Power with melee weapons. Warriors gain 2 melee Attack Power per point of Strength.
   * Strength does not improve the chance to block but it increases the amount of damage that can be blocked with a shield.
2. **Stamina**
   * After Strength, you’ll want as much Stamina as you can find. Stamina only increases your maximum health, but this is crucial to your survivability. You take an absurd amount of damage as a melee attacker, making a large health pool very beneficial.
   * Increases health points by 10 per point.
3. **Agility**
   * Agility becomes much more important when you’re level 60, but it also benefits you before then. It gives Attack Power, Critical Strike Chance, and Dodge.
   * Increases Attack Power with melee weapons. Warriors gain 1 Attack Power for each point of Agility.
   * Increases chance to score a critical hit with a weapon. You gain 1% Critical chance increased for each 20 points of Agility.
   * Increases chance to Dodge attacks. For every 20 points in Agility you will gain 1% chance to Dodge.
4. **Spirit**
   * You’re also going to want plenty of Spirit while you’re leveling. Spirit lets you regenerate your health when you’re out combat. This means you’ll spend less time sitting and eating, meaning faster leveling overall.
   * Increases health & mana regeneration rates.

### Talent Path

[![warrior leveling build wow classic](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Warrior-Leveling-Build-WoW-Classic.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/tools/talent-calculator/warrior/#?t=A000225555592aaaee88dhddddgggggpB2222211111bbbbbeeeee)

[Talent Order](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/tools/talent-calculator/warrior/#?t=A000225555592aaaee88dhddddgggggpB2222211111bbbbbeeeee)

Despite Fury being the better end-game damage specialization, arms is much better for leveling thanks to reliable rage generation and damage output. Your goal is to max out the Arms tree to pick up [Mortal Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/21551), after which leveling definitely becomes easier.

### Abilities to Train

* **Level 1-10** – Learn every ability offered to you. Complete the [Defensive Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/71) quest.
* **Level 12** – [Battle Shout](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5242) rank 2, [Overpower](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7384), [Shield Bash](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1672)
* **Level 16** – [Heroic Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/285) rank 3, [Mocking Blow](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/694), [Shield Block](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2565)
* **Level 24** – [Retaliation](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20230), [Battle Shout](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/6192) rank 3, [Heroic Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1608) rank 4, [Intimidating Shout](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5246), [Execute](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5308)
* **Level 30** – [Overpower](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7887) rank 2. Complete the [Berserker Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2458) quest.
* **Level 32** – [Heroic Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11564) rank 5, [Battle Shout](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11549) rank 4, [Execute](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20658) rank 2
* **Level 36** – [Whirlwind](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1680)
* **Level 40** – [Execute](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20660) rank 3, [Heroic Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11565) rank 6
* **Level 48** – [Battle Shout](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11550) rank 5, [Mortal Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/21551) rank 2, [Heroic Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11566) rank 7, [Execute](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20661) rank 3, [Overpower](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11584) rank 3
* **Level 50** – [Recklessness](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1719)
* **Level 54** – [Battle Shout](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11551) rank 6, [Mortal Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/21552) rank 3
* **Level 56** – [Heroic Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11567) rank 8, [Execute](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20661) rank 4

### Class Quests

* **[Defensive Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/71):** At level 10, you’ll unlock your first class quest, which will eventually reward you with [Defensive Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/71). This is one of your three core stances and is required to interrupt before level 38. You’ll also be able to use important defensive abilities, but you will need to equip a sword and shield.
* **Brutal/Fire Hardened Armor**: Once you’re level 20, you’ll unlock another class quest chain. After completing it, you’ll have received a nice pair of legs, gloves, a helm, and a blue chest piece that you can actually use to receive 30 rage once an hour. The equipment is fantastic for leveling, but you might have a hard time soloing this until you’re around level 30.
* **[Berserker Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2458) & [Whirlwind Weapon](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/1792)**: Upon reaching level 30, you’ll unlock the class quest for your final stance, [Berserker Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2458). You’ll need this to cast [Intercept](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20617), your other dash ability. More importantly, this quest chain culminates in a reward of one of three whirlwind weapons. You’ll definitely want [Whirlwind Axe](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6975) to benefit from your Axe Specialization talent. [Whirlwind Axe](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6975) is likely a weapon you won’t replace until level 60, but the quest is extremely difficult before you’re level 40.

### Equipment

* **Buy weapons from vendors** – When you’re low level, weapons that are sold by merchants are actually some of the strongest you can find. Somewhere in your race’s starting zone you can find a weapon vendor; don’t be afraid to purchase a weapon if it is an upgrade! At level 30, purchase a [Bullova](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2523) axe from a weapon vendor in a major city.
* **Do quests and/or dungeons for weapons** – Horde players certainly have an advantage here, as they have access to [Ragefire Chasm](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/ragefire-chasm#default) and [Wailing Caverns](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/wailing-caverns#default) quests. Both dungeons reward great low-level weapons. At higher levels, you can do [Uldaman](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman#default) and [Maraudon](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/maraudon#default) for even better weapons.
* **Get your [Whirlwind Axe](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6975) as soon as you can** – Your toughest class quest rewards you with the iconic [Whirlwind Axe](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6975), which you’ll probably use all the way until level 60. Yeah, it’s that powerful! The sooner you get it, the sooner you can start demolishing your enemies!
* Until level 40, warriors can use cloth, leather, or mail equipment. After level 40, they can also use plate gear. However, you should still prioritize gear that provides you with useful stats. Don’t be afraid to wear a piece of cloth or leather if it gives you a better combination of Strength, Stamina, and Spirit than a mail or plate piece does!
* While armor is certainly useful for keeping you alive and giving you extra stats, the attributes of your weapon are far more impactful. The overall damage, weapon speed, and DPS are the biggest factors. You can value a point of weapon DPS as 7 points of Strength, meaning any weapon upgrades you can find are invaluable.

Professions
-----------

Taking the time to level professions while you level will slow your progress, but they can significantly improve your quality of life. You’re free to pick all of the secondary professions ([Fishing](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-horde-fishing-guide-1-300/), [Cooking](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-cooking-guide-1-300/), and [First Aid](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-first-aid-guide-1-to-300/)), but you can only have two primary professions. Which you should choose will ultimately depend on what your goals are. Do you only want to make gold, or would you like a professions that can craft useful equipment for your character?

Here are some great professions to train while leveling a warrior:

* [**Mining**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-mining-guide-1-300/) – Whether you’re interested in making gold or crafting equipment, mining is an excellent choice either way. You’ll need the ore to create weapons and armor through blacksmithing, or bombs and gadgets with engineering. Metal ore also fetches a nice price on the auction house, making mining an extremely versatile pick.
* [**Blacksmithing**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/blacksmithing-1-300/) – You can’t go wrong with blacksmithing as a warrior. This will allow you to craft useful armor and weapons, which are crucial to keeping you alive. You can also create sharpening stones, which will give you a slight damage boost while fighting.
* [**Engineering**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-engineering-guide-1-300/) – Engineering is one of the best end-game professions, but it’s also quite useful for leveling. Gadgets you create through engineering are much more useful against normal creatures you’ll fight while leveling compared to raid environments. The bombs are also helpful in case you get surrounded.
* [**Herbalism**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-herbalism-guide-1-to-300/) – Another good choice here is herbalism. You can pair this with mining for two gathering professions, an excellent gold-generating combo. Alternatively, you can save them to make potions with alchemy.
* [**Alchemy**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-alchemy-guide-1-to-300/) – Alchemy is one of the best professions you can have for leveling, regardless of your class. You’ll have access to several different potions with a variety of effects. Some have long durations that grant you bonuses, while others are one-time shots to restore health and mana. Potions can dramatically turn the tide of any battle, making alchemy an excellent leveling profession.

Useful Macros
-------------

**Start Attack** – Start attack macros are important so you don’t have to manually right-click mobs to attack them. You bake them into your abilities as a macro so even if you don’t have enough rage to use an ability such as [Heroic Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/78) or [Mortal Strike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12294), you will still attack the target. Example:

```
#showtooltip HeroicStrike
/startattack
/cast Heroic Strike
```

**[Charge](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11578) / [Intercept](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20617)** – Puts you into [Battle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7165) / [Berserker Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2458) depending on whether you’re in combat, and you can cast it again to use the correct dash spell.

```
/cast [nocombat,stance:1] Charge; [combat,nostance:3] Berserker Stance; [nocombat,nostance:1] Battle Stance; [combat,stance:3] Intercept
```

**Stance Juggling** – Switches between all of your stances. It alternates between [defensive stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/71) and [battle stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7165), and switches to [Berserker Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2458) if you control-clickcit.

```
/cast [modifier:ctrl,nostance:3] Berserker Stance; [stance:1] Defensive Stance; Battle Stance
```

**Whirlwind** – Switches to [Berserker Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/2458) and uses [Whirlwind](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1680).

```
/cast [stance:3] Whirlwind; Berserker Stance
```

**Overpower** – Switches to [Battle Stance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7165) and uses [Overpower](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7384).

```
/cast [stance:1] Overpower; Battle Stance
```
