Welcome to our WoW Classic leveling guide for the paladin class! Noble paladins are known for using their devotion to the light to repel evil they encounter across Azeroth. They can do this in a number of ways, allowing them to serve as a healer, tank, *or* a damage-dealer. Armed with plenty of useful buffs and crowd control, a paladin is one the Alliance’s core classes.

Most level 60 paladins are typically relegated to healing, although a few do occasionally pass as a tank. In even rarer situations, you can find a Retribution Paladin in a raiding environment, although they are often viewed as a poor DPS class. While Retribution is weaker than a pure damage class like a mage, it can still handle its own and is phenomenal for leveling with.

Leveling a paladin is unlike many other classes, so you’ll want to understand how you can make the most of a limited toolkit. We’ll go over helpful tips for leveling a paladin, including how you can allocate your talents, priorities for stats, an effective rotation, and general advice that will make the whole process easier. Don’t let anyone discourage you from playing a paladin if you enjoy it. You can certainly deal respectable damage and can be quite useful if you know what to do!

#### Pros

* Fantastic survivability and utility.
* Can serve as a backup healer in a pinch.
* Fully capable of soloing, but also a great addition to any group with the use of blessings for party members.
* Laidback rotation allowing you to relax.
* [Free mount at level 40 and discounted epic mount at level 60](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/paladin-epic-mount/).

#### Cons

* Fairly low base damage.
* Not many abilities to use.
* Can quickly run out of mana if spamming [Judgement](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20271) without proper blessing.
* Can be confusing to know what seals, auras, and blessings to use. Also difficult to keep track of them all.
* Big responsibility in any raiding role, required to keeping blessings on party members at all times.
* One of the slowest classes to level.

General Leveling Tips
---------------------

Paladins certainly aren’t well known for being a quick class to level, but they are very sturdy. This makes them excellent for soloing and tackling stronger enemies like elites, even if it does take them longer than most to kill. The gradual pace of a paladin is perfect for allowing you to slow down and appreciate Azeroth in all of its beauty. One thing you’ll definitely notice is each time you gain a stronger spell or piece of equipment. When damage is naturally hard to come by, each little bit helps make the difference and makes leveling quicker.

Here are some useful tips for leveling your paladin:

* Consider running dungeons every 5 levels or so. Weapon upgrades are huge for paladins, and you need specific ones if you want to use [Seal of Command](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20375). Dungeons are often the best source for better weapons and they’ll also give you a nice break from the leveling grind.
* Retribution paladins have no consistent area-of-effect damage, which means fighting multiple enemies at once is fairly silly. You won’t be able to damage more than one at a time, while still receiving damage from both. Try to fight one-on-one as much as possible.
* You should also aim to fight enemies that are only equal in level to you. Higher level enemies naturally cause you to deal less damage, but they also grant reduced experience. Lower level creatures are weaker, but they also give less experience.
* This is easier to do if you carefully decide what zones you want to level in. Not all zones are optimally designed for leveling, nor are they all feasible for the Alliance. Make sure to pick zones suited for your faction and around your level.
* Make sure to constantly have a stack of relevant food and water. Starting at level 5, every 10 levels you can pick up stronger food and water. You’ll inevitably spend *some* time eating and drinking, so make sure this time is minimized by using up-to-date refreshments.
* You’re already going to be doing a lot of running for quests, so kill any monsters you see along the way. You can’t reach level 60 from questing alone (unless you always have rested experience), so you’ll need to kill monsters at some point to make up the difference. When you’re already passing them by is a great time to conveniently pick up some experience.
* Paladins certainly don’t need to group up, but doing so is a very smart choice. You are an extremely sturdy class, but you don’t deal a ton of damage. Paladins are a support class, meaning they’re great in combination with other classes. With your auras, blessings, and any heals you manage to send out, other players will *love* having you in a group, which also makes leveling faster for you!

Paladin Specific Gameplay Advice
--------------------------------

* When it comes to deciding on what blessing to choose, you’ll actually want to use [Blessing of Wisdom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19742). This will allow you to freely cast [Judgement](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20271), giving you the biggest benefit from your seals. While [Blessing of Might](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19740) does add more damage, you’ll be able to cast significantly more before needing to drink when using [Blessing of Wisdom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19742).
* The seal you use largely depends on what weapon you have. More specifically, what the weapon speed is. If it is 3.5 or slower (3.6, 3.7, etc), then you should use [Seal of Command](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20375). Otherwise [Seal of the Crusader](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/21082) will deal more damage.
* Your aura will shift depending on how many enemies you are fighting. Once you have [Sanctity Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20218), it becomes your best single target option. The defensive bonus from [Devotion Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/465) makes it the better option when fighting multiple enemies.
* Don’t be afraid to use your lengthy cooldowns when in a pinch. As a paladin, you have several. [Lay on Hands](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/633) will fully heal you or an ally at the cost of all your mana, but does have an hour long cooldown. [Divine Shield](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/642) is your own personal bubble, while [Blessing of Protection](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1022) is a secondary bubble that you can also use on yourself.
* Feel free to use [Hammer of Justice](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/853) on cooldown. At max rank it stuns for 6 seconds and has a 60 second cooldown, meaning you can effectively keep enemies stunned 10% of the time. This will help mitigate the damage you take, letting you spend longer without sitting to eat. You can do the same with [Repentance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20066) once you learn it, but it only works on humanoids.
* Make sure to use all of your abilities as soon as you can. This will create natural gaps where you are doing nothing but auto attacking, which will allow you to benefit from [Blessing of Wisdom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19742)’s mana regeneration.
* You can heal easily in any spec 40+ with [Blessing of Light](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19977) and down ranked [Holy Light](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/635).
* Judgement is not on the global cooldown (GCD).

### Stat Priority

1. **Strength**
   * Your best stat is going to be Strength. This directly boosts the numbers of your auto attacks, which is one of your biggest sources of damage.
   * Increases Attack Power with melee weapons. Paladins gain 2 melee Attack Power per point of Strength.
   * Strength does not improve the chance to block but it increases the amount of damage that can be blocked with a shield.
2. **Agility**
   * Another solid stat choice is Agility. This also gives you Attack Power, but at a 1:1 ratio. However, Agility also provides a small Critical hit chance *and* Dodge chance, making it a great stat for damage and defense.
   * Increases Attack Power with melee weapons. Paladins gain 1 Attack Power for each point of Agility.
   * Increases chance to score a critical hit with a weapon. You gain 1% Critical chance increased for each 20 points of Agility.
   * Increases chance to Dodge attacks. For every 20 points in Agility you will gain 1% chance to Dodge.
3. **Stamina**
   * Because paladins need to fight in melee range, you’ll want some Stamina to allow you to soak up enemy attacks. If you’re having a hard time staying alive, then you might want some more Stamina.
   * Increases health points by 10 per point.
4. **Intellect**
   * Intellect is also fairly useful for a paladin because it will let you cast [Judgement](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20271) with less strain to your mana pool. With [Blessing of Wisdom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19742) this is less of a problem, but Intellect can help ensure that.
   * Increases mana points by 15 per point and the rate at which weapon skills improve.
5. **Spirit**
   * Spirit is also helpful, but just not as good as any of the other stats here. You’ll be able to use Spirit regen in between [Judgement](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20271) casts, but Spirit isn’t often a convenient stat to acquire because you’ll generally sacrifice Strength or Agility.
   * Increases health & mana regeneration rates.

### Rotation

Despite the sheer number of auras, seals, and blessings a paladin has, there are only a few you really want to use for leveling. You’ll always want to use [Blessing of Wisdom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19742), but your aura depends on the situation and your seal will change based on your weapon speed.

When fighting just one enemy, [Sanctity Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20218) is your best choice for max damage. For multiple targets, [Devotion Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/465) is likely a safer choice. If you have a weapon attack speed of 3.5 or slower, you’ll use [Seal of Command](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20375). Otherwise, use [Seal of the Crusader](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/21082).

Open every fight with your seal, then use [Judgement](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20271). After that you’ll simply auto attack until [Judgement](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20271) is ready again. Because you’re using [Blessing of Wisdom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19742), you shouldn’t have too much issue using [Judgement](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20271) whenever it is available. If your seal ever expires, you’ll simply reapply it. Once an enemy is at 20% health or lower, you can start using [Hammer of Wrath](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/24275). The rest of the time will be filled with auto attacks.

To simplify:

* **Single Target**: [Blessing of Wisdom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19742) > [Sanctity Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20218) > [Seal of Command](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20375)/[Seal of the Crusader](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/21082) > [Hammer of Wrath](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/24275) > [Judgement](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20271) > Auto Attack
* **Multiple Targets**: Same as single target but using [Devotion Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/465).

### Why is a Swing Timer Important?

Before you get started leveling it is of *vital* importance that you download and setup a swing timer.

A swing timer addon measures the time between your weapon swings. It is useful to know this information so you can use abilities and move freely without clipping into your natural auto attack cycle and consequently losing damage.

While the bar is loading to full it means you can move freely, you are not wasting any damage. As it starts to fill back up this signals that your auto attack cooldown has almost reset and you should position yourself to swing again.

### What Seal Should I Use?

[Seal of Command](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20375) = Best with slow 2H weapon

* 3.5 weapon speed or slower
* Best seal to use pre-level 32 if you have the weapon to support it.
* This will proc 7 times per minute (PPM).
* This PPM is how the ability is balanced.
* You can’t increase the PPM but you can increase the damage per proc with a slow 2H weapon.
* You can also twist seals using [Seal of Command](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20375).

[Seal of Righteousness](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20154) = Best with fast weapon

* 3.4 weapon speed or faster
* Best seal to use with a weapon that is 3.4 speed or faster.
* Best seal to use when you are single target killing with [Reckoning](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20177). Each Reck stack benefits from [Seal of Righteousness](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20154) as opposed to SoC.
* If you can sustain through the mana cost judge this Seal on Cooldown as it offers instant damage.

[Seal of the Crusader](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/21082) = Judge during long fights

* Fights lasting 30 sec+
* Judge [Seal of the Crusader](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/21082) before [Seal of Righteousness](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20154) or [Seal of the Crusader](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/21082) on long fights where you will be able to extract full value from the holy damage bonus.

### Tips for Saving Mana

A paladin without mana is a sad paladin indeed. Here are a couple of tips that can save you a lot of mana while leveling:

* Don’t overlap your seals too much. You don’t need to refresh your seal if it still has 10 sec or more before expiring. The best case scenario would be to refresh it as soon as it expires, but since we’re not machines, try refreshing it *in the last 5 sec* as much as possible.
* *You also do not need to heal yourself to 100% health at all time*. If your resources are full, you’re not pushing your limits enough and **you are missing out on exp/hour**. It’s a skill that takes a little bit of practice to master, but eventually you will gauge how much health you are comfortable with. If you’re low on health and need to heal, heal up to *75-80%* and keep going. Unless you over-pull, you’ll do just fine with your mail/plate armor and your emergency buttons.

### Reckoning Build

[Reckoning](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20182) is a tier 5 talent in the Protection tree that when fully ranked (5/5) gives you a 100% chance to gain an extra attack after being critically hit.

This effect stacks up to 4 times and doesn’t go away until used. Thus the term “Reck bomb” was coined, where pallys stack up max stacks and save them until an opportune time to deal massive damage to a player or NPC.

This talent is amazing because we can control when we get crit with 100% certainty by sitting down mid combat. By using a /sit macro all physical attacks made against you (not spells) are guaranteed critical hits.

#### Reckoning Rotation

**Levels 1-32:**

* If weapon is faster than 3.5 sec, use [Seal of Righteousness](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20154).
* If weapon is 3.5 sec or slower, use [Seal of the Crusader](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/21082).
* Use [Blessing of Wisdom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19742) unless mana is not an issue.
* For single targets, use [Sanctity Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20218).
* If fighting 2 or more mobs, use [Retribution Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7294).

**Levels 32-60 Multi-Target**:

* Start with 1H + shield equipped.
* Use [Blessing of Sanctuary](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20911).
* [Retribution Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7294) should be active.
* Cast [Seal of Light](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20165) and pull multiple mobs (as many as you can handle).
* Once mobs are gathered, attack one and sit down immediately with your /sit macro. Keep spamming this macro until you are at 4 stacks.
* Turn around, [Judgement](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20271), and reapply [Seal of Light](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20165), then turn back around and attack, dumping all [Reckoning](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20182) stacks with a fresh seal applied.
* Rinse and repeat!

**Levels 32-60 Single Target:**

* Start with 2H equipped.
* Use [Blessing of Wisdom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19742).
* [Retribution Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7294) or [Devotion Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/465) based on the attack speed of mob.
* Cast [Seal of Righteousness](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20154) and melee the mob once.
* Spam your sit macro until you get 3-4 [Reckoning](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20182) stacks.
* You will then unleash your [Reckoning](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20182) stacks when appropriate followed by a [Judgement](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20271) and [Seal of Righteousness](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20154).
* Using [Hammer of Justice](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/853) single target is inefficient since it will prevent you from being hit for its duration.
* Judging every CD isn’t as efficient as you will be tight on globals.

**Levels 32-60 Full Retribution Build:**

* Start with 2H equipped.
* Use [Blessing of Wisdom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19742) unless mana is not an issue.
* For single targets, use [Sanctity Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20218).
* If fighting 2 or more mobs, use [Retribution Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7294).
* Use [Consecration](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/26573) only when [Vengeance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20049) procs. Use it at any point in the rotation but don’t clip your auto attacks.

#### Reckoning Talent Builds

Ret-Reckoning Build (Fastest)

Start in Retribution tree:

* 5/5 Benediction
* 2/2 Improved Judgement
* 3/5 Parry
* 1/1 Seal of Command
* 2/2 Pursuit of Justice
* 5/5 Conviction
* 5/5 Parry
* 1/1 Sanctity Aura
* 1/3 2H Weapon Specialization

Respec at Lvl 32 to a Reckoning build in Protection:

* 5/5 Redoubt
* 3/3 Precision
* 2/2 Guardian’s Favor
* 1/1 Blessing of Kings
* 3/3 Shield Specialization
* 1/5 Toughness
* 3/3 Improved Hammer of Justice
* 3/5 Toughness
* 5/5 Reckoning
* 1 Blessing of Sanctuary

Proceed into the Retribution tree:

* 5/5 Benediction
* 2/2 Improved Judgement
* 3/5 Parry
* 2/2 Pursuit of Justice

Back to the Protection tree:

* 5/5 One-Handed Weapon Specialization
* 1/1 Holy Shield

Back to the Retribution tree:

* 5/5 Conviction
* 2/2 Improved Retribution Aura

**Notes About This Spec:**

The core assumption with this build is that AoE grinding with [Sanctuary](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20911), [Redoubt](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20127), and [Reckoning](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20182) will be the fastest way to 60.

From 1-32 you will go a straightforward Retribution path, prioritizing sustain with [Blessing of Wisdom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19742) over [Might](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19740) and Judging [SoR](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20154) on cooldown. You respec at 32 because you can get 3/5 [Reckoning](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20182), which represents the efficiency breaking point for it to be reliable.

Ideally you should strive for a slow 2H weapon with high damage range using [Seal of the Crusader](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/21082) and [Hammer of Justice](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/853) on cooldown. However, if only faster weapons are available, use [Seal of Righteousness](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/20154). [Seal of the Crusader](https://wowclassicdb.com/spell/21082) is not worth it to kill on average mobs and should only be judged if you will extract its full value from the fight.

You get [Seal of Light](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20165) ranks every 10 levels ( 30, 40, 50, 60). From levels 30-35, 40-45, 50-55 [Seal of Light](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20165) will have the highest impact as it was newly obtained. For these levels you can be more aggressive about pulling. [Seal of Light](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20165) is used for your multi target [Reckoning](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20182) rotation, so as the efficiency of [Seal of Light](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20165) dies down from 35-40, 45-50, 55-60, consider using the 2H single-target rotation with [SoR](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20154) instead.

[1H Weapon Specialization](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/16538) > [Conviction](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20117) as Paladins don’t benefit as much from crit as say Warriors. Also, [Reckoning](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20182) can potentially be overkill at times, so smoother, more consistent damage is better.

If you plan on tanking dungeons you can shave off 3 points in [Toughness](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1166) for [Improved Righteous Fury](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20470) to drastically help you with threat.

### Talent Path

[![paladin leveling build wow classic](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Paladin-Leveling-Build-WoW-Classic.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/tools/talent-calculator/paladin?t=C2222255566666bb99999iaggglllllpA1111122222B1111144455)

[Talent Order](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/tools/talent-calculator/paladin?t=C2222255566666bb99999iaggglllllpA1111122222B1111144455)

Your best choice of leveling is going to be the [Retribution](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/pve-retribution-paladin/) spec. Although Retribution Paladins don’t have many offensive abilities, they have great survivability when playing alone. Because of the weapon you receive from your class quest, [Seal of Command](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20375) is not useful to you until you find a stronger and slower weapon. You’ll instead want to use [Seal of the Crusader](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/21082) until at least level 30, at which point you should then consider taking [Seal of Command](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20375) if you’ve found a replacement. There is an alternative Protection oriented build you could start using at this point that takes advantage of the [Reckoning](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20177) talent, but it requires you to be engaged and focused, completely disrupting the Retribution Paladin playstyle.

* **Level 40** – [Hammer of Justice](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5589) rank 3, [Devotion Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/1032) rank 5, [Holy Light](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/3472) rank 6, [Blessing of Protection](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/10278) rank 3

* **Level 60** – [Holy Light](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/25292) rank 9, [Hammer of Wrath](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/24239) rank 3, [Blessing of Wisdom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/25290) rank 6, [Devotion Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/10293) rank 7

### Class Quests

* [Redemption](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/1785): At level 12, you’ll unlock the ability to start a class quest for the [Redemption](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7328) spell. It is extremely simple, but will require you to run around a bit and will cost 10 [Linen Cloth](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2589) to complete. [Redemption](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7328) is important because it allows you to resurrect fallen allies. Only priests can also resurrect without a cooldown for the Alliance, making you quite handy in a group setting.
* [Verigan’s Fist](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/1806): At level 20, you should do whatever you can to complete the class quest line that rewards the weapon [Verigan’s Fist](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6953) and [Sense Undead](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/5502). This will require you to traverse across multiple zones and head into a few dungeons to pick up items. This is absolutely worth the hassle because it rewards you with Verigan’s Fist, an insanely powerful weapon that you may not replace until your mid-high 30s. It does have a quick attack speed though, meaning you’ll only want to use [Seal of the Crusader](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20308) with it.

### Equipment

* **At level 40 you can wear plate, but pick stats over armor type**. Paladins can use every armor type in the game. You should use this to your advantage because paladins also benefit from just about every stat. You should aim for plate armor if it is convenient because it will make you tankier, but stats should still come first. Don’t go crazy and run around in strictly cloth armor though, because this will get you killed very quickly.
* **Prioritize weapon damage range and speed instead of DPS**. Unlike other melee classes, damage range is *the* most important weapon stat for a paladin. This is because [Seal of Command](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20375) uses 70% of your weapon damage, a figure calculated from damage range. To use [Seal of Command](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20375) effectively, you’ll need a weapon speed of at least 3.5 or slower to ensure you receive 7 procs per minute.
* **Weapon upgrades are always a huge damage boost**. Much of your damage as a Retribution Paladin comes from auto attacking. This means that anytime you find a new weapon to use, you’ll definitely notice an increase in power. Consider running dungeons often to try and find blue weapons to make leveling easier.

### Professions

If you haven’t thought about taking up professions while you’re leveling, then now is a good time to pick some. Professions will extend the time you take to reach max level, but often times the time investment is well worth it. You can use professions to make gold, which is essential if you want to buy mounts. Considering movement speed directly translates to leveling speed, professions can indirectly help you level by funding your mount. They’re also fantastic for making armor and consumables that make combat much smoother.

Paladins benefit most from these professions while leveling:

* [**Mining**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-mining-guide-1-300/) – A solid profession to pick up for any class is mining. You can use this just to gather ore to sell, but you can also keep it to make armor with blacksmithing or bombs in engineering. As you’ll find many nodes naturally while questing, mining requires very little effort for you to level.
* [**Engineering**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-engineering-guide-1-300/) – If you’re already planning on taking mining, engineering is a great pairing. Not only is engineering one of the best *endgame* professions, but it is also quite useful for leveling. Bombs become more important, crowd control gadgets are more effective, and all your cool toys can actually be used in the open world.
* [**Herbalism**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-herbalism-guide-1-to-300/) – A great alternative is herbalism. You’ll also find plenty of herbs while you quest, so this is another low effort profession. You can sell the herbs on the auction house, or better yet, save them for potions and elixirs.
* [**Alchemy**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-alchemy-guide-1-to-300/) – One of the best leveling professions is alchemy. You can make plenty of fantastic potions and concoctions that help you deal more damage while also being tougher to kill.

### Useful Macros

* **[Seal of Command](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20375)** – This macro simply ensures that your auto attack begins without you needing to right click on an enemy. This will also ensure your attacks begin even if you’re out of mana.

```
/cast Seal of Command
/Startattack
```

* **[Seal of the Crusader](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20308)** – Just like the Seal of Command macro, this macro uses your seal while also starting your auto attack.

```
/cast Seal of the Crusader
/Startattack
```

* **Bubble Toggle** – This macro is excellent and a must-have for any paladin. With one press, this macro allows you to use your invincibility bubble to clear any debuffs and impairments. If you press it again, it will remove the bubble without you needing to right click the buff on your buff bar.

```
/cast Divine Shield
/unbuff Divine Shield
```
