My name is Judgement and I am a Classic WoW enthusiast. I have been playing WoW since Vanilla and in the most recent years I have been spending a lot of time playing Vanilla WoW private servers. After Classic was announced I started to work on leveling routes and doing speedruns which ultimately became the foundation of this guide.

**About the guide**
-------------------

This guide is specialized for Human Paladins but any class can follow it for a smooth route to level 60. If you don’t play Human you can enter the guide in either the Loch Modan or Darkshore part between levels 9-11. If you find this guide in the middle of your way to 60 it’s possible to jump into, but please note that the guide heavily relies on “breadcrumb” quests that are picked up in one zone and done in another, usually involving long chains, so you might not have access to all the quest.

There are some Paladin specific parts for class quests and item upgrades, but they can be skipped and replaced by your own class specific stuff if you are not playing Paladin.

When questing it’s important that you kill mobs while running between one area to another and doing objectives, this xp will add up a lot in the long run and will save you some time grinding to make up for lost xp.

Because of the lack of quest in certain level ranges, doing a few dungeons and their respective quests are highly recommended. If you are trying to speed level, dungeons are mostly not recommend unless you got a prepared guild or friends group since they can be huge time-sinks if you are going with random people in a non-organized group.

There are also some inconsistencies when it comes to which quests that are available and which aren’t. Many quests were changed and added during vanillas lifecycle, some of the most noteworthy are places like Thorium Point and Silithus. Because of the level 40 cap on the classic beta it’s been very hard to confirm which quests that will exist in phase 1 and which will not, so I apologize in advance if I happen to include any quests that don’t yet exist or intentionally skip a quest that I thought wouldn’t exist.

Having a good weapon is crucial for leveling fast. Some of the weapon upgrades I get in this guide is limited supply from vendors and will not always be available. I will point out when there is a new weapon upgrade available during the guide with the **<WEAPON UPGRADE>** notice.

**How to follow the guide**
---------------------------

* **When text is colored with Blue it means to accept a new quest.**
* **When text is colored with Green it means to turn in a quest.**
* **When text is colored with Red it’s important information.**

**Recommended Addons**
----------------------

* [**Questie**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/questie/)  
  
  Shows all available quests on the map for both accept and turn-ins. I will not be super detailed about where to pick up quests so if you aren’t familiar with them this is helpful. Also shows quest information on enemy mouseover for quest item drops.
* [QuestLogEx](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/questlogex/)  
  
  Gives you a bigger quest log so you can see your current quests in a much better view.
* [**Classic Castbars**](https://github.com/wardz/ClassicCastbars)  
  
  Enables enemy cast bars, very valuable for knowing when and what to interrupt.
* [**Onebag3**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/onebag3-classic/)  
  
  I would strongly recommend having a bag addon to be able to sort your bags and bank easier and saving time when selling stuff to vendors etc.
* [**OmniCC**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/omnicc/)  
  
  Add timers on your debuffs on targets. This feature doesn’t exist in standard Classic UI and is very good to know for judgements, repentance, hoj etc.
* [**Auto Attack Bar**](https://github.com/boxto/AbarClassic)  
  
  Will give you a “cast bar” for your auto attacks, useful in order to be able to time your seals and judgements in order not to lose out on any damage.
* [**Leatrix Plus**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/leatrix-plus-classic/)  
  
  Addon that can simplify and automate many functions like quest accepts and turn ins. Will save you a lot of clicks and time if you are trying to level fast. Also has many other functions like automatic ress accept, summon accept, automatic vendor sell/repair etc.

**Bank Alt**
------------

Making a bank alt to use as a personal storage or buy stuff on AH and send to your main while out questing or grinding on the other side of Azeroth is almost a necessity in Classic. The mailbox works like a huge bank storage and lasts for 30 days until it’s automatically sent back if you don’t open it. You can also learn Enchanting on your bank alt at level 5 which makes it able to disenchant any BOE items since there are no skill requirements for disenchanting. When you start looting level 40+ greens you should send them to your bank for DE, it’s usually more profitable then vendoring them and you will need the mats for enchants at 60. You should always have a few gold on your bank to be able to buy stuff on AH you might need during leveling.

**Paladin Talents 1-60**
------------------------

There are many different ways to spend your talents while leveling to 60. I recommend a combination of Ret and Prot talents for solo leveling and questing, here are some examples:

* [**Standard Ret**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/tools/talent-calculator/paladin?t=C1111144222abb9999922igggclllllA11111222229B2222244455) – **(Ret/Sanc aura)**
* [**Defensive Ret/Prot**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/tools/talent-calculator/paladin?t=C2222244666abbB111114445587777dddC9999966ggg8illlllp88) – **(Devo/Sanc aura)**
* [**Offensive Ret/Prot**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/tools/talent-calculator/paladin?t=C2222244555abb99eeB22222444558bbbbdddC999gggi6lllllp66) – **(Ret aura)**
* [**Ret/Reckoning**](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/tools/talent-calculator/paladin?t=C1111144555bbB22222444558777aaadddiiiiiCa9999966gggi6l) – **(Respec to at 46, Devo/Ret aura)**

**Dungeons**
------------

As I said earlier, dungeons are great for catching up on missing XP or a great alternative to grinding in certain level ranges. The dungeons I recommend you can see below, I also made dungeon guides for them with focus on completing all the dungeon quests and gaining as much XP as possible from one run.

#### [Rock Pulverizer](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/4983) weapon upgrade

This part can be counted as a Class Quest for Paladins and should not be done if you are another class (except Warrior if you aren’t getting Whirlwind Axe). At this point your current weapon will most likely be something like [Archeus](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/2000), or maybe even worse. It’s starting to get outdated at this point, and unless you are planning on running all wings of SM soon to get [Bonebiter](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/6830) I would suggest you to do this part, it should take around 30 mins solo or faster if you can get some help and you will get a really good weapon.

Last boss also drops two very good 2h weapons which will be very good for us and can last all the way to 60, so doing Uldaman is a very good idea.

27. HS back to Booty Bay or if HS is on cooldown run to Nethergarde Keep and fly.
28. <WEAPON UPGRADE> You should start looking to buy a new BOE weapon now if you didn’t get one from Uldaman. There isn’t really any more weapons you can get until you either do Maraudon Princess runs at around lvl 50, and if you are leveling fast people will probably not have the scepter ready by then. The weapons I recommend looking out for are [**Blade of the Titans**](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/13043) and [**Executioner’s Cleaver**](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/13018). Expect to pay up to 50g+ for one of them. It may seem much but this weapon will last until 60 if needed so it’s definitely worth.

11. Our first objective is to complete The Flawless Flame. Kill Heavy War Golems, Magma Elementals and Fire Elementals to get the stuff you need. Of course you can also kill the other stuff you have quests for while searching for these like Dark Iron dwarves or spiders, but focus on getting The Flawless Flame completed first.
12. When you got Golem oil and Hearts of Flame return to Kalaran and turn in [The Flawless Flame](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/3442), accept [Forging the Shaft](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/3443).
13. Return to Thorium Point, turn in [Fiery Menace](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/7724) and [Curse these fat Fingers](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/7723) if you have completed them, then fly to Ironforge.

15. Fly back to Thorium Point. Now we go down into the Slag Pit below. There are two ways to get there, either you jump down in the hole close to where Kalaran are or you can go around into the central area and take the normal way in, I recommend jumping down. Use BoP on yourself to avoid falling damage.
16. Run north in the cave and kill dwarfs until you reach the bigger room with a ramp on your right. Turn in [Dwarven Justice](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/3371) at the dwarf on the floor and accept [Release Them](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/3372).
17. Continue up the ramp. In the next room to your right you have Overseer Maltorius, he’s a 50 elite so you probably can’t solo him, but we want the plans on the table behind him. You should be able to get these by stunning him with HoJ and looting it since he’s a spellcaster, so after the HoJ he will cast a shadow bolt giving you extra time to loot the plans before you get interrupted.
18. After you looted the Plans run away to the bridge and jump down on your left side and you will enter the Incendosaur cave.
19. Clear the Incendosaur cave until you kill 20 of them and then leave.

22. Return to Thorium Point and turn in the quests you have completed.THIS PART WILL INVOLVE SOME ELITE/GROUP QUESTS, SKIP IF SOLO AND CAN’T FIND A GROUP FOR IT, CAN ALSO TRY AGAIN LATER ON
23. Now we need to kill some cultist elites to continue, it’s possible to solo the Twilight Dark Shamans you can find to the west outside the cave, just interrupt their heals and you should be fine, the Fire Guards are much harder so avoid them. Getting a group for this will make it much easier. If you can’t solo them or get a group you can skip these quests for now and come back and do them later, around level 50 and you should have no problems doing it.
24. Kill a few cultists until you loot Symbol of Ragnaros. If you get a group you can run up the hill next to the cave and you will find a night elf sitting in a cage next to a pool of lava, the best way to do this is to have one party member aggro all the cultists and run away while the other members get the quest, then repeat for all members in the party. Accept [Prayer to Elune](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/3377), talk with the night elf and turn it in. Accept the follow up.
25. The Mysterious Artifact you need for Release Them are in the center of the Lava Pool, to get it jump into the pool and stand on top of the Artifact, then loot it, otherwise you will take lava damage and get interrupted.
26. Continue killing elites until you loot Symbol of Ragnaros and Prayer to Elune.
27. Return to Kalaran and turn in [The Flame’s Casing](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/3452). Accept [The Torch of Retribution](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/3453). Wait for him to create the torch then turn in. Accept next, then click on the Torch to turn in.

30. Accept [Rise, Obsidion!](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/3566) This quest is semi hard, you need to fight two 52 elites at the same time, if you can’t, skip.
31. Continue up the ramp and kill Overseer Maltorius.
32. Return to Thorium Point and turn in [WANTED: Overseer Maltorius](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/7701).
33. While still in your group, go back to the outhouse where you started in this zone and continue southeast into the mountains, there you will find Margol the Rager. Kill him and loot Margol’s Horn. Accept [The Horn of the Beast](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/3181).

1. Accept all the quests from the Bloodmages to the west to kill and collect stuff in Blasted Lands.
2. Kill beasts in Blasted lands for the quests, focus on birds, basilisks and boars since there are fewer of them. Keep doing laps around the northern and center part of the zone and kill everything.
3. When you complete a quest you can turn it in to make it easier to see how much you have left since they all require the same items. In total to complete all the quests you need the following:  
   
   6x [Blasted Boar Lung](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/8392)  
   
   6x [Scorpok Pincer](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/8393)  
   
   11x [Basilisk Brain](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/8394)  
   
   5x [Snickerfang Howl](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/8391)  
   
   14x [Vulture Gizzard](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/8396)  
   
   Since you need the most of Brains and Gizzard and they are the hardest to get you may not be able to complete all of the quests, if it takes too long to get a certain item, skip the quest that requires many of that item.
4. When done with the quests, keep the consumables you get for progression raids.

60+ The End
-----------

We have now reached the end of the guide. I hope you found it helpful and you reached 60 in a good time. I will continue to work on the guide after Classic launch and fix/change things to make it better over time.

You still have a few elite quests scattered around Azeroth to do, and of course lots of dungeon quests. If you are not yet 60 I recommend any of the following:

1. Grind! Probably the fastest way to 60, some spots I recommend are:  
   
   | -Furbolgs in Winterspring | Timbermaw rep, Firewater,Winterfall E’ko |
   | --- | --- |
   | -Owlbeasts in Winterspring | Lots of vendor greys |
   | -Elementals in Silithus | Hydraxian rep, Elemental earth, Essence of Earth |
   | -Satyrs in Felwood | Runecloth, Felcloth, Demonic runes |
   | -Blackrock Orcs in BS | Runecloth, greys, others. |
2. Complete any remaining quests scattered around Azeroth There are still some elite quests to do in the higher level zones, try to look for groups and do them.
3. Run some end game dungeons and do the quests BRD and Strat have a lot of dungeon quests, so those would be preferred to do to maximize your XP gains. You could also do some quick 2-3 boss runs in LBRS to start farming pre-raid bis gear.
