Hello and welcome to our 1-60 horde leveling guide for WoW Classic! There are multiple ways to level up in Azeroth, but this guide will make things simple for you. The quests and grinding sessions included are sequenced to get you to level 60 as fast as possible! 

This guide does use a combination of questing, grinding, and a few dungeons (skippable). It will still take you multiple days of in-game played time to finish, but you’ll get there in due time if you carefully follow each step below. Without further ado, let’s get to leveling!

### Guidelines

* **Race Choices** – This guide is designed to be usable with every horde race. If you’re an orc or troll, this won’t require any extra work from you. Undead and tauren characters can follow this guide if you jump in at level 12. There are a few places where this affects the guide, but we’ll explain them when it happens.
* **Hearthstones & Inns** – Only change your hearthstone home location when indicated in the guide. You’re going to use it several times to return to specific locations. Additionally, try not to use your hearthstone unless mentioned during the guide so you have it available when needed. Whenever you’re finished with a leveling session, always try and return to an inn so you can accumulate rested experience.
* **Chain Quests** – WoW Classic is packed full of chain quests. Some of these are quite fun and lead to great rewards, while others are a waste of time. This guide takes chain quests into consideration and **only** lists chain quests that you should accept. Meaning, if a quest is not listed in the guide and you see it from a quest giver, don’t pick it up! This can cause your quest log to fill up if you take too many quests that aren’t covered.
* **Grinding** – Grinding is an inevitable part of your leveling journey, but fortunately there isn’t *too* much of it. Grinding sessions will be distributed evenly throughout the guide so you won’t ever need to spend countless hours doing it. To cut down on the time that you *do* spend grinding, kill every monster you see when running between quest objectives.
* **Dungeons** – There are multiple instances where it is recommended to run a dungeon. Dungeons are excellent sources of loot, but they also usually have quests associated with them to give you boatloads of experience. You do need to find a group, but the hassle is definitely worth it. Dungeons *are* all optional, but you will need to spend more time grinding to make up for it instead.
* **Confused?** – We tried our best to make this guide as coherent as possible, but everyone makes mistakes! If there is anything that doesn’t make sense or you can’t find something, click the link in the guide to find detailed information and locations of NPCs.

### Key

* Blue text means that it is time to accept a new quest.
* Green text means that it is time to turn in a quest.
* Red text means that there is something you should do or know.

### Purchase List

Throughout the guide, you will need some items to complete quests. You’ll probably need to purchase these from the auction house, but they aren’t too expensive and are well worth the experience and convenience they offer for following this guide. The level listed next to each item is when you will need it during the guide.

Purchase these items before each level listed:

Level 1-12
----------

Our guide begins in The Valley of Trials, Durotar. Both orc and troll characters naturally spawn here. If you’re a tauren or undead start the guide in the Barrens at level 12.

[![Wow Classic Horde Leveling Guide 1 11 Durotar](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-1-11-Durotar.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-1-11-Durotar.jpg)

#### Level 1

1. Accept your first quest: [Your Place In The World](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/4641). Run west and turn in Your Place In The World. Pick up the next quest: [Cutting Teeth](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/788).
2. Kill boars to the north and south until you reach level 2.

#### Level 2

1. Run north from The Den. Begin hugging the mountain as you run north. Eventually you’ll come across a ramp to your left. Run straight across from it to pick up the quest: [Sarkoth](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/790).
2. Climb the ramp and kill the scorpion [Sarkoth](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3281). Remember to loot him.
3. Run back down the ramp turn in Sarkoth. Accept the next quest: part two of [Sarkoth](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/804).
4. Now return to The Den. Turn in Cutting Teeth and Sarkoth. You should be level 3 now.

#### Level 3

1. Accept the quest: [Sting of the Scorpid](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/789). There should be another quest available specific to your class. It simply requires you to find and talk to your class trainer.
2. All trainers should be close nearby, but a few are actually inside The Den. Talk to your trainer and hand the quest in.
3. Before leaving, pick up the quests: [Vile Familiars](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/1499) and [Galgar’s Cactus Apple Surprise](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/4402). Run a little farther east and accept the quest: [Lazy Peons](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5441).
4. Run just north and stay around the area, killing any grellkin and scorpions you see. Make sure to also collect apples from the cactus bushes and wake up sleeping orcs with your blackjack when you see them.
5. Return to the foreman east of the The Den and turn in Lazy Peons. You should now be level 4.

#### Level 4

1. Turn in Sting of the Scorpid, Vile Familiars, and Galgar’s Cactus Apple Surprise.

4. Eventually you’ll find [Yarrog Baneshadow](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3183). Kill and loot him. Jump to the level just below you.
5. Start hugging the wall on your left until you find another room. Inside will be [Thazz’ril’s Pick](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/178087). After collecting it, use your hearthstone to go back to the Valley of Trials.
6. Turn in Burning Blade Medallion. You should be level 5 by now. Accept the next quest: [Report to Sen’jin Village](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/805).

#### Level 5

1. Find your class trainer and accept the quest they have for you. This will lead to another short quest later on, which you should do as soon as it is convenient. Because each class has different quests, they won’t be covered in the guide. *f you are playing a Tauren or* Undead character, these class quests will not be available to you.  It is advised that you complete your class quests in your own starting zone before getting to the Valley of Trials, or simply skip the level 1-12 section of this guide.
2. Start running east and turn in Thazz’ril’s Pick. Run through the gate and pick up the quest: [A Peon’s Burden](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/2161).
3. From here, keep run southeast to reach Sen’jin Village. Kill any enemies you see along the way.
4. In Sen’jin Village, turn in Report to Sen’jin Village. Pick up all six quests in the village: [A Solvent Spirit](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/818), [Practical Prey](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/817), [Zalazane](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/826), [Minshina’s Skull](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/808), [Thwarting Kolkar Aggression](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/786), and [Report to Orgnil](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/823).
5. Now follow the road north to Razor Hill. Kill scorpions and anything else you see until you are at least level 6.

#### Level 6

1. Once you get to Razor Hill, turn in Report to Orgnil. Accept the next quest: [Dark Storms](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/806). Go inside the inn and set your hearthstone to Razor Hill. Turn in A Peon’s Burden before you leave.
2. Go outside and pick up the quests: [Encroachment](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/837), [Break a Few Eggs](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/815), and [Vanquish the Betrayers](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/784). Go into the large building across the inn to learn first aid.
3. Run up the hill to the northwest and climb the tower to pick up the quest: [Carry Your Weight](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/791). Some classes will have a simple quest to complete now, which they should do.
4. Run southeast out of Razor Hill until you see a keep in the distance, killing anything in your path.
5. Once you arrive at Tiragarde Keep, kill and loot all the humans you find. You also need to enter the keep and reach the main room. On the second floor, you’ll find [Lieutenant Benedict](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3192). Kill him and loot his body.
6. With the key you just acquired, run to the other hallway and climb the stairs to get outside. Up there you’ll find a chest to open with an envelope inside. Use the envelope to acquire the quest: [The Admiral’s Orders](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/830).
7. Jump off the keep and kill humans in the area until your quest is complete *and* you are level 7.

#### Level 7

1. Run northwest back to Razor Hill. Remember to kill any silly enemy that gets in your way. Once you arrive, turn in Vanquish the Betrayers. Accept the next quest: [From The Wreckage….](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/825)
2. Turn in The Admiral’s Orders. Accept the next quest: another [The Admiral’s Orders](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/831). Run outside and climb the tower atop the hill again to turn in Carry Your Weight. Before leaving town, sell to a vendor to clear out your bags.
3. Leave Razor Hill by running mainly east to reach the beach. Make your way into the water and find Gnomish Toolboxes at the bottom.
4. Kill everything in the area until A Solvent Spirit is complete. Then run west *past* Razor Hill until you find some quilboars.
5. Kill [Razormane Quilboars](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3111) and [Razormane Scouts](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3112) in the area until you reach level 8.

#### Level 8

1. Head east to go back to Razor Hill. Turn in From The Wreckage…. Now leave Razor Hill by running south. You’ll need to go all the way to Sen’jin Village, killing any beasts that you see along the way.
2. Once you’re near Sen’jin village, start heading west until you see some Centaurs (half human, half horse). Enter the opening in the mountain.
3. Go all the way through the clearing and enter each tent you see. Find the attack plans at three different locations to finish up Thwarting Kolkar Aggression.
4. Leave the clearing back the way you came. Run east to reach Sen’jin Village. Turn in Thwarting Kolkar Aggression and A Solvent Spirit. Sell to clear out your bags and buy some food.
5. Run southeast from the village until you hit the water. Now you need to swim all the way to the islands in the distance.
6. Once you get to Echo Isles, kill all the tigers and raptors you find. Look for piles of eggs on the ground near trees too.
7. In the middle of the isles, you’ll find several buildings and a hill with [Zalazane](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3205) waiting on it. Kill and loot him. Pick up a skull on the ground nearby.
8. If you aren’t yet level 9, keep killing trolls and tigers in Echo Isles.

#### Level 9

1. At this point, it is actually faster just to die and resurrect at the spirit angel than it is to swim back. Either die by aggroing a bunch of trolls, or just swim back to Sen’jin Village.
2. Turn in Zalazane, Minshina’s Skull, and Practical Prey. Use your hearthstone to head back to Razor Hill.
3. Run out of the inn and turn in Break a Few Eggs. Sell and buy food if you need it. Leave Razor Hill by heading west to find more quilboars.
4. Kill [Razormane Dustrunners](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3113) and [Razormane Battleguards](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3114) this time. Keep doing this until you finish Encroachment *and* you’re at least half way to level 10.
5. Run north from here until you see a hut in the distance. Enter it and accept the quest: [Lost But Not Forgotten](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/816).
6. Now run to the goblin to your northeast. Pick up the quest: [Winds in the Desert](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/834). Now run east to the harpies and pick up the sacks there.
7. Return to the goblin and turn in Winds in the Desert. Accept the next quest: [Securing the Lines](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/835). Now go back and kill harpies until you have just a bubble left to reach level 10.
8. Run back south to reach Razor Hill. Turn in Encroachment. Sell any junk and repair your armor.

#### Level 10

1. Do your class quest now! Go to the west gate of Razor Hill when you are done and accept the quest: [Conscript of the Horde](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/840).  
   
   If you are playing a Tauren or Undead character, these class quests will not be available to you.  It is advised that you complete your class quests in your own starting zone before getting to the Valley of Trials, or simply skip the level 1-12 section of this guide.
2. Run out of Razor Hill’s North gate toward Orgrimmar. Once there, go to the Valley of Wisdom and pick up the quest [Hidden Enemies](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5726). Turn in The Admiral’s Orders as well.
3. Leave Orgrimmar to return to Durotar. Run southeast to the harpies and sacks from earlier. Run south this time until you find a cave.
4. Run through the cave and kill the harpies you find there for Securing the Lines. Leave the cave the way you came.
5. Run northwest back to the goblin and turn in Securing the Lines. Now run west until you reach the river, killing any raptors and scorpions you see on the way.
6. Kill crocodiles until you find the amulet for Lost But Not Forgotten. Run south along the river until you it opens up into a clearing. Run east until you see the entrance to Thunder Ridge.
7. Run through Thunder Ridge, killing everything you see. Keep exploring until you see [Fizzle Darkstorm](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3203). Carefully kill him and loot his corpse.
8. Kill enemies in Thunder Ridge until you are level 11.

#### Level 11

[![Wow Classic Horde Leveling Guide 11 17 The Barrens](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-11-17-The-Barrens.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-11-17-The-Barrens.jpg)

1. Exit Thunder Ridge the way you came. Now run east to the little hut. Turn in Lost But Not Forgotten.
2. Now run southeast back to Razor Hill. Turn in Dark Storms. Pick up the next quest: [Margoz](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/828). Repair your armor now and sell any junk.
3. Run northeast of Razor Hill so you are up above it. Follow the path all the way north until you find Margoz. Turn in Margoz. Accept the next quest: [Skull Rock](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/827).
4. Run north from here until you find a cave filled with cultists. Fight your way through the cave and loot everything.
5. Once you have six collars and an insignia, try to find an orc named [Gazz’uz](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3204). Kill him if you can, but he’s tough so don’t worry if you can’t.
6. If you killed Gazz’uz, loot him and use the eye to start the quest: [Burning Shadows](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/832). Leave the cave and run south back to Margoz.
7. Turn in Skull Rock. Accept the next quest: [Neeru Fireblade](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/829). Run northwest to Orgrimmar and head for Thrall.
8. Turn in Hidden Enemies. Accept the next quest: another [Hidden Enemies](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5727). Now go to the Cleft of Shadows.
9. Turn in Neeru Fireblade and Burning Shadows (if you killed Gazz’uz earlier). Accept the next quest: [Ak’Zeloth](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/809). Talk to Neeru until Hidden Enemies is done.
10. Run back to Thrall to hand in Hidden Enemies. Now use your hearthstone to go back to Razor Hill.
11. Run all the way west until you get to the Barrens. Turn in Conscript of the Horde. Pick up the next quest: [Crossroads Conscription](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/842).
12. Turn in Ak’Zeloth next to the tower. Accept the next quest: [The Demon Seed](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/924). Don’t forget to pick up a stone before leaving.
13. Run west until you see a way up the mountain. Climb it and fight your way to the cave. Go inside and use the stone on the altar. Avoid the rare elite here unless you have help.
14. Now run back South to the road and retrace your steps to the tower where Ak’Zeloth waits. Go to him and turn in The Demon Seed. Then go back west along the road, towards Dreadmist Peak, but instead of going North, head south – killing everything you encounter along the way.
15. Keep killing enemies until you need just about 200 experience to reach level 12. Enter The Crossroads and learn the flightpath. Set your hearthstone to The Crossroads now.
16. Turn in Crossroads Conscription to reach level 12.

#### Level 12

1. Pick up all of the quests available at The Crossroads. This includes: [Plainstrider Menace](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/844), [Raptor Thieves](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/869), [Supplies for the Crossroads](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5041), [Fungal Spores](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/848), [The Forgotten Pools](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/870), [Disrupt the Attacks](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/871), and [Wharfmaster Dizzywig](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/1492).
2. Head out of The Crossroads and start running in a circle around it, killing any plainstriders that you see. You should also kill any raptors you see now and during other quests until you have enough heads to complete Raptor Thieves.
3. Head back in to The Crossroads and hand in Plainstrider Menace. Turn it in and accept the follow up: [The Zhevra](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/845).
4. Now you’ll go west out of The Crossroads until you find a bunker with a quest giver that will have two quests – [Kolkar Leaders](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/850) and [Centaur Bracers](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/855). Accept both of them. Make sure to kill any raptors and zhevra you see.
5. Go north from here until you come across a few centaur camps. Ignore the tents for now, but start killing centaurs and go towards the trees. Once you see patches of blue mushrooms then you are in the right spot.
6. Pick four of the mushrooms ([Fungal Spores](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5012)) to finish that quest, then run into the nearby lake and dive to the bottom. Look for a bubbling crack and swim over to it to finish up The Forgotten Pools.
7. Now you’ll head west to find a larger building up on a small hill. Right next to it is a much tougher centaur, [Barak Kodobane](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3394). He is level 16 and attacks from range with a bow. However, he does run away at low health. When there are no nearby patrols, fight and kill Barak Kodobane. If you can kill him now go for it, otherwise skip to the next step first and try again.
8. Kill centaur back east around the fungal spores until you are level 13.

Level 13-24
-----------

#### Level 13

1. After reaching level 13, go south towards the building where you picked up quests earlier. Turn in Kolkar Leaders and accept the follow up quest: [Verog the Dervish](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/851).
2. Now go east to make your way back to The Crossroads. Kill any zhevra if you still need them.
3. Turn in The Zhevra, The Forgotten Pools, and Fungal Spores. Accept **only** two of the follow up quests: [Prowlers of the Barrens](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/903) and [The Stagnant Oasis](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/877).
4. Sell junk items, clear up your inventory, and buy food if you need it.
5. Go north out of The Crossroads until you see a camp of quilboars to your right. Run over there and kill quilboars until Disrupt the Attacks is complete.
6. From here, go south until you’re run into the  east road out of Crossroads, then go east on the road towards Ratchet.  Kill any raptors you see along the way.
7. Learn the ratchet flightpath. In Ratchet, turn in Wharfmaster Dizzywig and take the follow up: [Miner’s Fortune](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/896). In the rest of the town, accept the following quests: [Southsea Freebooters](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/887), [Samophlange](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/894), [WANTED: Baron Longshore](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/895), and [The Guns of Northwatch](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/891).
8. Go south from Ratchet, closely following the coast to your left. Kill enough pirates to complete Southsea Freebooters, but don’t worry about [Baron Longshore](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3467) yet.
9. Return to Ratchet and turn in Southsea Freebooters. Accept the next quest: [The Missing Shipment](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/890). Complete this quest by talking to Wharfmaster Dizzywig.
10. Pick up the next quest: another [Missing Shipment](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/892). Immediately turn in The Missing Shipment. Accept the next quest: [Stolen Booty](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/888).
11. Now you can leave Ratchet again by heading west. Circle the cliff to your right (north) and climb up to kill prowlers for Prowlers of the Barrens.
12. Once that’s finished, head back to The Crossroads and turn in all your completed quests to reach level 14.

#### Level 14

1. Pick up new quests available to you: [The Disruption Ends](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/872), [Echeyakee](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/881), and [Stolen Silver](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/3281). Go to the south part of town to find Mankrik for two more quests to accept: [Lost in Battle](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/4921) and [Consumed by Hatred](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/899). Once you have all of those, you can pick up a timed quest: [Apothecary Zamah](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/853).
2. If you are playing as a tauren, fly directly to Thunder Bluff to skip steps 3-4.
3. Since you *aren’t* tauren, you will instead need to run to Thunder Bluff. Start running south out of The Crossroads towards Camp Taurajo. Make sure to pick up the flight path.
4. From here go west to enter Mulgore. Once you get to Bloodhoof Village, start heading north until you get to Thunder Bluff.
5. Go to the Pools of Vision, which is located underneath Spirit Rise. Now you can turn in Apothecary Zamah. Accept the follow up quest: [Serpentbloom](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/962). Go pick up the flight path and fly to Camp Taurajo.
6. Go north from the camp until you find two buildings. One of them will house Mankrik’s wife. Interact with the corpse for Lost in Battle. Use your hearthstone to take you back to The Crossroads. Once you’re back in town, turn in Lost in Battle.
7. Now go north out of The Crossroads until you find a hut and some Venture Co. peons. Fight your way into the hut to find a control console inside.
8. Interact with the console to turn in Samophlange. Accept the follow up quest: also named [Samophlange](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/900). Go outside and turn all the valves off around the nearby piece of large machinery. You need to find three; one on the back, right, and left.
9. After using all three valves, go back into the hut with the control console. Turn in Samophlange and pick up the next quest: also named [Samophlange](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/901).
10. Head northeast from the hut until you find another goblin hut. Inside is [Tinkerer Sniggles](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3471). Kill him and loot the key off his corpse. Head back to the control console again and turn in Samophlange. Pick up the last follow up quest: no surprise here, also [Samophlange](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/902). Feel free to destroy your operating manual for the control console because you won’t need it anymore.
11. Go south until you find some prowlers and kodo bones. You’re here to kill [Echeyakee](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3475), so clear out prowlers to have an even fight. Use the [Horn of Echeyakee](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/10327) in your bags to summon him. Kill Echeyakee and loot his body.
12. Now you’ll keep going south until you find the quilboars from earlier. Now you’ll go east to find the geomancers and defenders. Kill them as you begin to head south towards a larger camp. In this camp, you need to kill [Kreenig Snarlsnout](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3438).
13. Once Kreenig Snarlsnout is dead, make sure to loot his body and then search around for a stack of supply crates for Supplies for the Crossroads. Go back to The Crossroads and turn in Echeyakee and Supplies for the Crossroads. Accept the follow up quest: [The Angry Scytheclaws](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/905).
14. Make your way to Ratchet and turn in Samophlange. Accept the next quest: [Wenikee Boltbucket](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/3921). Head south next to the coast again to revisit the pirates. While you’re here, look for two lockboxes. One is found close to the water and the other is further west near the mountains.
15. You also need to kill [Baron Longshore](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3467) while you’re here, who you did ignore earlier. Pick up his head after killing him and go back to Ratchet. Turn in Stolen Booty and WANTED: Baron Longshore. Now you should be level 15 or close enough to continue. While you are still in Ratchet, pick up the quest: [Raptor Horns](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/865).

#### Level 15

[![Wow Classic Horde Leveling Guide 11 17 The Barrens](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-11-17-The-Barrens.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-11-17-The-Barrens.jpg)

1. From Ratchet, start going southwest to reach The Stagnant Oasis. Kill any centaurs you see along the way. Look for another bubbling crack in this oasis like you did for The Forgotten Pools. Swim towards it to complete The Stagnant Oasis.
2. Go west to find another centaur building on top of a hill. This is where [Verog the Dervish](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3395) will spawn, but he won’t show up until you kill enough centaurs. There isn’t a specific amount, but eventually one will shout aloud as they die. When this happens, Verog the Dervish will appear. Slay him and don’t forget to loot his corpse.
3. The Stagnant Oasis is one of the best places to grind for your level, so you’ll want to kill centaurs and turtles in the area until you reach level 16. Focus on the [Kolkar Bloodchargers](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3397), but switch to [Oasis Snapjaws](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3461) when there aren’t any left alive. This will take you somewhere between 50 and 100 kills depending on your RNG for quest item drops and how much grinding you’ve done.

#### Level 16

1. After reaching level 16 start heading west. Pass through The Crossroads to reach [Regthar Deathgate](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3389). Turn in both Verog the Dervish and Centaur Bracers. Accept the net quest: [Hezrul Bloodmark](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/852). Make your way back into The Crossroads and turn in The Disruption Ends. Also turn in The Stagnant Oasis and accept followup [Altered Beings](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/880).
2. Now is a great time to sell, repair, and buy any food if you need it. When you are ready to leave, fly to Camp Taurajo. Set your hearthstone to Camp Taurajo!
3. When you’re finished with that, start running northeast. Continue running until you reach the Raptor Grounds, avoiding any quilboars you see along the way.
4. Once you arrive at the Raptor Grounds, head towards the back of the grounds, killing any raptors that you see along the way.
5. When you see a small camp with three raptors around it, you’ve reached the right spot. Kill all three raptors and look around where they were standing to find the [Stolen Silver](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/147557).
6. At this point you probably don’t have enough horns for Raptor Horns, so continue killing raptors until you’re finished. You’ll also need 3 [Sunscale Feathers](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5165) as one of the requirements for The Angry Scytheclaws.
7. After collecting all three sets of quest items, run north to find some guarded nests. Kill the raptors surrounding them, then use your Sunscale Feather on the nest. Do this for all three nests.
8. Once finished, keep running north until you hit the Stagnant Oasis. Now head west to reach Lushwater Oasis. Kill Oasis Snapjaws until you have enough shells to complete Altered Beings.
9. You also need to kill [Hezrul Bloodmark](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3396) while you’re still here. He patrols around the oasis and has two bodyguards with him, so try to take them both out and run away so you can fight him one-on-one. When you have a fair fight, kill Hezrul and loot his head.
10. Head north and turn in Hezrul Bloodmark. Ignore the next quest for now and start running east until you get to Ratchet. Once you arrive, turn in Raptor Horns. Accept the next quest: [Smart Drinks](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/1491). Make sure you also pick up the quest: [Deepmoss Spider Eggs](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/1069). This is a good time to pick up the quest: [Trouble at the Docks](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/959) if you’re interested in running through Wailing Caverns later.
11. Run west to get back to The Crossroads. Turn in Altered Beings. Accept just one of the follow up quests: [Hamuul Runetotem](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/1489). Turn in The Angry Scytheclaws. Get the next quest: [Jorn Skyseer](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/3261). Turn in Stolen Silver and you should now be level 17. Before leaving The Crossroads, pick up the quest: [Report to Kadrak](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6541).

#### Level 17

1. Head north from The Crossroads and follow the road until you are in Mor’shan Rampart. Turn in Wenikee Boltbucket. Accept the next quest: [Nugget Slugs](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/3922).
2. Now go east around the mountain to reach Sludge Fen. Run north a little ways until you find a goblin shredder from which you should accept the quest: [Ignition!](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/858) Start running to the south towards the tower in the middle of the water.
3. While you’re running, pick up any tool buckets you notice along the way because these hold the [Nugget Slugs](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11143) you need. Ascend the tower and kill [Supervisor Lugwizzle](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3445).
4. Return to the shredder to the north and turn in Ignition! Pick up the next quest: [The Escape](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/863). This begins an escort, but it does take a few minutes for the shredder to actually start moving. Kill any drudgers and mercenaries you see in its immediate path.
5. Eventually you will reach a ramp and the shredder will stop while two Venture Co. enemies attack you. After killing them the escort will be complete. Before leaving, make sure to collect any Nugget Slugs you need to finish that quest up.
6. If you’re an orc, troll, or undead character then skip this step. Tauren characters will need to pick up the flight path for Orgrimmar. To do this, run east until you hit a river and then run north until you find a bridge. Cross the bridge and enter the gate to enter Orgrimmar. Ask a guard for help locating the flight master. Pick up the flight path, then return to Sludge Fen by exiting Orgrimmar the way you came, running south for a few minutes, then running directly west to reach Sludge Fen.
7. Now go west to return to Mor’shan Rampart. Turn in Nugget Slugs. Accept the next quest: [Rilli Greasygob](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/3923). Run a little further north into the ramparts and turn in Report to Kadrak. Accept the follow up quest: [T](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6543)[he Warsong Reports](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6543).
8. Next you’ll take a lengthy detour into Ashenvale to complete the quest you just picked up, primarily for the flightpaths you’ll pick up along the way. Follow the road north until it splits into two. Head along the Eastern route until you reach Splintertree Post.  
   
   [![Wow Classic Horde Leveling Guide 17 Ashenvale](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-17-Ashenvale.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-17-Ashenvale.jpg)
9. You can find a guard to give your first warsong report to in the middle of a tower just outside the gates. Head into the outpost and learn the flightpath. Once you finish up, follow the road leading north until you reach Satyrnaar. There is another guard to give a warsong report to here, patrolling the road outside.
10. Follow the road leading back to Splintertree Post. After you get there, take the road that leads back to a two-way split and this time head west across Ashenvale. Zoram’gar Outpost is on the opposite side of the zone and can basically be reached by following the road. However, an alliance city, Astranaar, is in the middle of the road so make sure to stay clear of it.
11. Keep following the road west through Astranaar until it begins to curve north. Start running along the road north until you get to Maestra’s Post. From here run just a bit further north until you find a path leading to the west. At this point you can run straight west, avoiding the mountain, leading you straight to Zoram’gar Outpost.
12. Give your last warsong report to the guard in the outpost. Pick up the flightpath for the area and take a flight back to The Crossroads. Now is an excellent time to sell, repair, and restock.
13. Head out the west gate of The Crossroads and keep running until you get close to Stonetalon Mountains. Right before crossing zones, you’ll notice a quest giver on the side of the road. Accept the quest: [Avenge My Village](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6548).  
    
    [![Wow Classic Horde Leveling Guide 17 Stonetalon Mountains](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-17-Stonetalon-Mountains.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-17-Stonetalon-Mountains.jpg)
14. Go northwest from here until you find Camp Aparaje. Kill tauren around the village until your quest is complete. Return to the southeast to turn in Avenge My Village. Accept the follow up quest: [Kill Grundig Darkcloud](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6629).
15. From here, take the road leading west into Stonetalon Mountains until you come across a road to your right. Follow the road there and enter the tauren encampment. Within the settlement is a tent with [Grundig Darkcloud](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11858) standing outside.
16. Kill him and six [Grimtotem Brutes](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11912) to finish your quest. Before leaving, go back to the tent where you find Grundig. Talk to the tauren there to start the escort quest: [Protect Kaya](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6523).
17. Simply follow [Kaya](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11856) as she goes west out of the camp and south on the road. Once you are attacked by three tauren at once, ensure that all attackers only hit you or else Kaya will quickly die. Now that you’re finished, turn in Protect Kaya and Kill Grundig Darkcloud.  Accept the next quest: [Kaya’s Alive](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6401).
18. Get back on the road and start running northwest. Eventually you’ll come across Malaka’jin. Enter the settlement and accept the quest: [Blood Feeders](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6461). Exit Malaka’jin and return to the road. Keep running northwest until the road begins to point straight north.
19. At this point you should head west into Sishir Canyon, which is filled with spiders and eggs. Kill enough spiders to finish up Blood Feeders and pick up enough eggs to complete Deepmoss Spider Eggs.
20. If you aren’t yet level 18, continue killing spiders in the area until you are. Leave the canyon and follow the road north until it splits into two. Take the western path and follow it until you end up at Sunrock Retreat. Turn in Kaya’s Alive. Make sure to learn the flight path while you are still here.

#### Level 18 & 19

[![Wow Classic Horde Leveling Guide 18 19 The Barrens](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-18-19-The-Barrens.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-18-19-The-Barrens.jpg)

1. Start following the road south again and follow it all the way until you are back at Malaka’jin. Turn in Blood Feeders. Use your hearthstone now to return to Camp Taurajo. Immediately take a flight to Thunder Bluff.
2. When you arrive, go to elder rise and turn in Hamuul Runetotem. Accept the follow up quest: [Nara Wildmane](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/1490). She is inside the same tent, so run over to her and turn in Nara Wildmane. Accept the next quest: [Leaders of the Fang](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/914).
3. Go back to the flightmaster and take a flight to Orgrimmar. Go to the Valley of Honor and turn in Rilli Greasybob. Accept the next quest: [Samophlange Manual](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/3924). Now is a good time to restock, repair, and sell.
4. Once you’re all caught up, use the west gate of Orgrimmar to exit. Run southwest across the river until you find the Boulder Lode Mine. Slowly fight through the mine to reach the back.
5. Kill [Boss Copperplug](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/9336) here and loot his [Samophlange Manual Cover](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11147). Now make your  way back out of the mine. Near the entrance, continue to kill Venture Co. enemies. When you have a [Cats Eye Emerald](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5097) and five [Samophlange Manual Pages](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/11148), you can leave the area by heading west.
6. Keep running west until you reach Mor’shan Rampart again. Turn in Warsong Reports. Use your hearthstone to take you back to Camp Taurajo (or fly from Splintertree Post).
7. At Camp Taurajo, turn in Jorn Skyseer. In the camp, accept two quests: [Ishamuhale](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/882) and [Tribes at War](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/878). Proceed by exiting Camp Taurajo to the north and keep running until you find quilboar.
8. Once you find the quilboar camp, kill them for their tusks and [Blood Shards](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5075). When you first arrive you’ll see [Water Seekers](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3267), but further north there are [Thornweavers](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3268) and even farther you can find [Geomancers](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3269). Kill quilboar in this area until you have killed 12 thornweavers, 12 geomancers, and 6 water seekers. You’ll also need 60 tusks and 11 shards.
9. When you’re finished with the quilboar slaughter, return to Camp Taurajo by running south. Turn in Tribes at War. Accept the next quest: [Blood Shards of Agamaggan](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5052). Immediately hand in Blood Shards of Agamaggan.
10. Take this time to clear out your bags and repair. When you’re ready to go, complete the repeatable quest: [Spirit of the Wind](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/889). This will give you a speed boost for the long run ahead.
11. Run directly east until you hit the mountains. When you find them, start running north along the mountains until you find Northwatch Hold. Keep running on the path leading into the hold until you reach the top of the hill. From here, you’ll need to ascend the western tower. There is a pack of three enemies inside, but once they’re killed you can find [Cannoneer Smythe](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3454) up top. Kill all guards and Cannoneer Smythe.
12. Once you finish up with the western tower, you’ll want to head towards the eastern tower. There are also three enemies in here and another cannoneer at the top. Repeat what you did with the western tower and then leave the tower. Keep killing guards in the hold until you have 10 [Theramore Medals](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5078).
13. Go back down the hill and head towards the keep. Kill any enemies you find around both the outside and inside. There are four enemies inside, but you can split them into two pulls. Once they are dead, climb the tower and kill any guards that get in your way. At the top there are four guards and [Captain Fairmount](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3393).
14. Pick all the guards off one-by-one and then kill Captain Fairmount. Now go back down the tower and talk to the elf offering a quest at the bottom. Accept the quest: [Free From the Hold](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/898). This begins an escort so follow him and keep him alive. It isn’t difficult, but he does die quickly.
15. Once you reach Ratchet, the escort will be complete. You should now have several quests to turn in, including The Escape, Free From the Hold, Miner’s Fortune, The Guns of Northwatch, and Deepmoss Spider Eggs.
16. After turning in quests, exit Ratchet to the west, but immediately turn and start running straight north towards the mountain. Kill a zhevra and loot their carcass. Once you have the carcass, keep running north until you find a large dead tree. Use your zhevra carcass to summon [Ishamuhale](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3257) and slay him.
17. Now you’re headed back to The Crossroads. This is due west of your location, but there is a mountain in the way. Follow the mountain until you are on the other side, then proceed west to reach The Crossroads. Turn in Consumed By Hatred.
18. Take a flight to Camp Taurajo. Turn in Ishamuhale. Accept the next quest: [Enraged Thunder Lizards](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/907). Follow the main road near Camp Taurajo north until it begins to curve to the east. At this point, run just west off the road and look for a kodo named [Lakota’mani](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3474).
19. Kill him and pick up his hoof. From the hoof, accept the quest: [Lakota’mani](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/883). Kill other [Thunderheads](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3239) in the area until you are finished with Enraged Thunder Lizards. Run south to return to Camp Taurajo. Turn in Lakota’mani. Turn in Enraged Thunder Lizards.
20. Now take a flight to Orgrimmar. Go to the Valley of Honor once again and turn in Samophlange Manual. This should get you to level 20.

#### Level 20

1. You should run a couple dungeons now to get some stronger equipment and experience. You have multiple quests for Wailing Caverns already, so that is your best option here. Alternatively you can also do Shadowfang Keep. Either way, do dungeons until you are level 21.

#### Level 21

1. Change your hearthstone location to Orgrimmar! Then take a flight to Camp Taurajo. Accept the quest: [Cry of the Thunderhawk](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/913). Leave the camp and kill [Thunderhawks](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3424) until one drops the wings you need.
2. Return to camp and turn in Cry of the Thunderhawk. Accept the next quest: [The Ashenvale Hunt](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6382). You should now use your hearthstone to return to Orgrimmar.
3. Take a flight to Splintertree Post in Ashenvale. Turn in The Ashenvale Hunt. Accept the next quest, also named [The Ashenvale Hunt](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6382). This is a simple dialogue quest. Turn in The Ashenvale Hunt again.
4. Now you’ll need to take a flight to Zoram’gar Outpost on the other side of Ashenvale. Accept the quest: [Naga at the Zoram Strand](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6442).
5. At this point you should grind on mobs all the way to level 22. Depending on what dungeon you did, you may not need to do this at all. Kill the naga and crabs around Zoram Strand for easy experience. Save any pages of the [Shredder Operating Manual](https://vanillawowdb.com/?search=shredder+operating+manual+-+page) that you find.

#### Level 22

1. If you don’t have 20 [Wrathtail Heads](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/5490) yet, continue killing the naga until you do. Return to Zoram’gar Outpost and turn in Naga at the Zoram Strand. Use your hearthstone to return to Orgrimmar. Repair your equipment, buy consumables, and store any shredder pages in the bank.
2. Run out of Orgrimmar and head for the zeppelin tower to your left. Go to the top and ask the goblins which zeppelin will lead you to Undercity. Ride the zeppelin and go inside Undercity to pick up the flight path (unless you are undead).
3. Leave Undercity. Follow the road leading to the west all the way into Silverpine Forest. Keep following this road for several minutes, even as it begins to curve straight south and goes over a bridge. Once you cross the bridge, you’ll soon encounter a path splitting of to your right. Follow the patch to reach The Sepulcher.
4. Get the flightpath for The Sepulcher. Accept the quests: [Journey to Hillsbrad Foothills](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/493) and [Beren’s Peril](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/516). Leave the Sepulcher and continue running along the road to the south. Follow it all the way through the mountains and keep doing so as it opens up into a clearing. Eventually the road will begin to curve east.
5. You should now run east, hugging the mountain on your left to find the entrance to Beren’s Peril. Kill six of both enemy types here to complete your quest. Run south to return to the road and follow it all the way east into Hillsbrad Foothills.
6. Keep running along the road until you notice a tower to your right. Approach it and accept the quest: [Time to Strike](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/494). Get back on the road and keep running until you see another tower where the road splits into a north and east path. Take the north road all the way to Tarren Mill.
7. Pick up the flightpath for Tarren Mill. Turn in Journey to Hillsbrad Foothills and Time to Strike. Accept all of the following quests: [Battle of Hillsbrad](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/527), [WANTED: Syndicate Personnel](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/549), [The Rescue](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/498), [Elixir of Pain](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/501), [Elixir of Suffering](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/496), and [Dangerous!](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/567)
8. Now start running southeast. Kill any bears and spiders that you see along the way. Cross the river when you get to it and keep running southeast. Soon you’ll come across Durnholde Keep. Run around the wall until you find the entrance to the south.
9. Enter the keep and cross the bridge. Kill enemies around the entire keep until you find [Jailor Marlgen](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2428) and [Jailor Eston](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2427). Pick up keys from both of them.
10. Now you need to find the two prisoners and free them, [Tog’thar](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2238) and [Drull](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2239). To find Tog’thar, follow the path near the bridge at the entrance as it curves up the hill. As you are running you should see Tog’thar in chains to the right. Drull is in a wooden house on the lower level next to the bridge.
11. Once you free both prisoners, you can just start freely killing mobs in Durnholde Keep until you reach level 23.

[![Wow Classic Horde Leveling Guide 22 23 Hillsbrad Foothills](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-22-23-Hillsbrad-Foothills.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-22-23-Hillsbrad-Foothills.jpg)

#### Level 23

1. Now you can leave Durnholde Keep, going northwest to make your way to Tarren Mill. Continue killing any spiders and bears that you see. Once you finally have the ichor for Elixir of Suffering, ran back to Tarren Mill.
2. Turn in WANTED: Syndicate Personnel, The Rescue, and Elixir of Suffering. Clear up your inventory and repair while you’re still in town. Start running west until you hit the mountains. Make sure to kill any lions you see along the way. Run south from the mountains to find Hillsbrad Fields.
3. Within Hillsbrad Fields, make your way to the smaller of two houses. Near it you should find [Farmer Getz](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2403), who you should kill. After killing him, go north to find a larger house. Either around the house or inside you will find [Farmer Ray](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/232). Kill him too.
4. After killing Getz and Ray, you should kill farmers in the area until Battle of Hillsbrad is complete. Don’t try to kill footmen.
5. Now run northeast to make your way back to Tarren Mill. Along the way and before heading into town, kill lions until you have enough blood. Enter Tarren Mill and turn in Battle of Hillsbrad. Accept the next quest: also named [Battle of Hillsbrad](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/528). Turn in Elixir of Pain. Accept the next quest: also [Elixir of Pain](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/502). Pick up another quest in town: [Souvenirs of Death](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/546).
6. Run west and south again to make your way to Hillsbrad Fields. Go to the larger house in the northern field. Look for [Stanley](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2274) the dog to turn in Elixir of Pain. Make sure you kill [Enraged Stanley](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2275) afterwards for a nice chunk of experience.
7. Run south from here to the other field. Look for [Farmer Kalaba](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2451) and kill her. Kill at least 15 peasants, then head back to the northern field.
8. Continue killing farmers in the north fields until you are just one bubble of experience away from level 24.

#### Level 24

1. Now you should fly to The Sepulcher. Turn in Beren’s Peril. Use your hearthstone to return to Orgrimmar. Now is a great time to sell and buy anything you need from the auction house. Try to have 10 slot bags or better before going out to quest again.
2. Get any shredder manual pages that you have stored in your bank. Get on a flight to Splintertree Post. Once you arrive, accept the quests: [Satyr Horns](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6441) and [Stonetalon Standstill](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/25).

Exit the tower and keep going along the road until you see a camp to your left. Enter it and take the quest: [The Lost Pages](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6504). If you have any combinable chapters, do so now to save space. Leave the camp and run northeast to get back to Splintertree Post.
4. Take a flight to Zoram’gar Outpost. Accept the quest: [Vorsha the Lasher](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6641). Walk with [Muglash](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/12717) until he stops at a brazier. When he says so, use the brazier and kill a few waves of enemies. Muglash is quite strong and won’t likely die, so let him tank damage for you. Focus the priestess on the second wave.
5. Run back to Zoram’gar Outpost and turn in Vorsha the Lasher. Accept the next quests: [Between a Rock and a Thistlefur](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/216) and [Troll Charm](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6462). Run due east until you get to Thistlefur Village – it will take a couple minutes.
6. Kill the furbolgs in the area until your quest is finished. For the charms, go deeper into the village until you find a stone arch that leads to a cave. Down there, you can find chests containing the charms. Don’t do the escort quest here unless you are in a group.
7. Once you finish, exit the cave and leave the village. Run west all the way to Zoram’gar Outpost. Turn in Between a Rock and a Thistlefur and Troll Charm. Ignore the next quest and take a flight to Splintertree Post.
8. Run south out of town until you cross the road. Look for stealthed [Ashenvale Outrunners](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6503) in the area filled with slimes. They tend to hide around trees and can be targeted with the tab key.
9. Once you kill 9 outrunners, go west until you see a band of orcs. Ignore the quest for now, but you will return to do it later. Keep going west to find Silverwing Outpost. Run up to the house and kill all the elves you see.
10. Run back to the band of orcs and pick up the quest: [Torek’s Assault](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6544). Escort Torek and keep him alive during the ambush. After you finish, kill the elves in the outpost until you are level 25.

Keep killing them until you pick up a [Logging Rope](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=16743#objective-of). Don’t stop killing furbolgs until you are 25% of the way to level 26.

5. Take a flight to Zoram’gar Outpost. Turn in Je’neu of the Earthen Ring. Use your hearthstone to return to Orgrimmar.
6. Now is a good time to repair and use the auction house. Buy any shredder manual pages that you are still missing! You should also try and purchase a [Deadly Blunderbuss](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/4369) at this time for an upcoming quest.

12. After you have all three skulls and all three pieces of quest gear, leave the area and run east to the road. Run up and down (north and south) the road to find a tauren quest giver. He has the quest: [Gann’s Reclamation](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/843).
13. Run southeast now until you reach Bael Modan. Go down the slope on the south side to enter. Kill any dwarves you encounter. Make your way to the other side of the excavation site to find and kill [Prospector Khazgorm](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3392).

[![Wow Classic Horde Leveling Guide 26 27 Ashenvale](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-26-27-Ashenvale.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-26-27-Ashenvale.jpg)

#### Level 27

1. Return to the road and follow it all the way back to Splintertree Post. Stay on the road here and follow it north to get to Satyrnaar. Starting killing the satyrs here and look for [Warsong Oil](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/178195) on the ground. If you can’t find any, look in the satyr camp to the north.
2. Go back on the road south and follow it until it splits into two. Run south off the road here and look for a hippogryph named [Sharptalon](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/12676). Wait until it paths towards the nearby undead camp and aggro it. With it chasing you, run to the Forsaken Camp for help.
3. Return to the road and follow it north back to Splintertree Post. Turn in Satyr Horns and Shadumbra’s Head. Accept the next quest: [The Hunt Completed](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/247). Now immediately hand in The Hunt Completed. Follow the road out of town and turn in Warsong Supplies.
4. This is probably the best time to go ahead and do Blackfathom Deeps over near Zoram Gar Outpost and it is strongly recommended that you do so.  You are already on the high end of the level requirement for the dungeon and there are a lot of quests for it at the Outpost.  You’ll also find at least one quest for BFD at Sunrock Retreat called [Trouble in the Deeps](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6562).  Another, [Allegiance to the Old Gods](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/6565) can be found by killing mobs in the areas leading up to the entrance portal.  If you complete all of the quests for BFD, you will find yourself well into your 28th level and then some *and* you will be bristling with really good loot.  If you are determined to avoid the dungeon you can either return to Raynewood Retreat and grind on Laughing Sisters, or alternatively, head back to Satyrnaar and grind on Satyrs.  Satyrnaar is closer to Splintertree Post than the retreat and the Satyrs there will not flag you in PvP.

#### Level 28

[![Wow Classic Horde Leveling Guide 28 Hillsbrad Foothills](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-28-Hillsbrad-Foothills.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-28-Hillsbrad-Foothills.jpg)

17. Get the flightpath before going back down. Ride down and go northwest until you see a large encampment of centaurs.

This should take you to level 31. If running the dungeon isn’t practical for you, the harpies in Thousand Needles are a good grinding alternative. If you choose to grind for the rest of that level, you will want to abandon A Vengeful Fate.

#### Level 31

[![Wow Classic Horde Leveling Guide 31 Thousand Needles](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-31-Thousand-Needles.jpg)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/WoW-Classic-Horde-Leveling-Guide-31-Thousand-Needles.jpg)

Loot the gizmo and then return to Whitereach Post to turn in Hypercapacitor Gizmo.

At this point, you’re probably going to want to do a dungeon to pad out your xp and get closer to the next level before continuing.  Otherwise, you’ll find a number of the quests in the next section to be a bit overwhelming.  There are a few options for which dungeon you can go to, but Razorfen Downs is probably the most give for your gold, especially if you’re Horde, as getting there will be convenient.  Almost all of the quests for RFD can be acquired either from Varimathras in Undercity, if you are Horde, or Archbishop Benedictus in Stormwind if you are Alliance.  The rest are picked up from NPCs just outside RFD’s entrance, or inside the dungeon itself.  Good luck.

29. Return to the Bulwark and turn in Fire Plume Forged, then pick up the quest next quest [Araj’s Scarab](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5804) from Apothecary Dithers.
30. Return to The Ruins of Andorhal and defeat Araj the Summoner to get [Araj’s Scarab](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/14610). Note:  This is not an easy task, as he is a level 61 Elite.  If possible, you might want to get a group together to take him on, which will transition well into the last steps of this guide.
31. Once you have the scarab, immediately return to The Bulwark and turn in Araj’s Scarab, then pick up [The Key to Scholomance](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5511), as well as [Barov Family Fortune](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5341) from [Alexi Barov](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11022).
32. At this point, you are going to want to do the dungeon Scholomance.  If you are a rogue and your lockpicking is high enough, you can technically skip the Key to Scholomance and its lead up quests, but you will miss out on all of the xp, so don’t.  There are about four other quests to get for the dungeon, besides Barov Family Fortune.  If you return to Lights Hope Chapel, you can pick up [Plagued Hatchlings](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5529), which will unlock the repeatable quest [Healthy Dragon Scale](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5582).  On the island of Caer Darrow, outside the dungeon itself, you can find the ghost of [Eva Sarkhoff](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11216).  Speak to her and read through the dialogue.  Once done, she will offer the quest [Doctor Theolen Krastinov, the Butcher](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5382) which is part of a chain that you should also finish.
33. Once you’ve completed Scholomance, you can turn in Doctor Theolen Krastinov, the Butcher to Eva, just outside of the dungeon.  Then Barov Family Fortune at the Bulwark and Plagued Hatchlings at Lights Hope Chapel.  At this point, you should have dinged to 60, or be very, very close.  If not, pick up [The Last Barov](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5342) from Alexi Barov at the Bulwark when you make the turn in to him.  Completing that quest rewards a very unique trinket the [Barov Peasant Caller](https://wowclassicdb.com/item/14022).  If you are still not at 60, you can pick up [Krastinov’s Bag of Horrors](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5515) from Eva and [Healthy Dragon Scale](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5582) at Lights Hope Chapel when you turn in Plagued Hatchlings, then run dungeon again.If you’d rather not group up again before 60, there are a handful of quests at Cenarion Hold in Silithus that you can finish to get you there.  Just hop on the zeppelin and take a flight there, since you got the FP earlier.  At *that* point, you should definitely be level 60.
