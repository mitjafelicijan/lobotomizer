They all at the same location, just have to look around for them , there are not too many shamans around , but you will find them.

LOCATION: 60,67

RUINS OF ISILDIEN

Good luck guys. | Can be found around 60,55 -- and south from that point | Subject: "Brutes"
You can find the Brutes at the first "e" in the word wilderness on the map. | Subject: "Experience/Reputation"
I completed this at level 47, when it had just turned green. I got an "increase" in my Darnassus reputation plus 3750 XP. | Subject: "found"
found shamans and warlocks at 60,67 | Subject: "shamans"
the reason theres no shamans is because people come  into the area and only kill the shamans, leaving all of the battlemasters and mage-lords around. The problem is, for every shaman thats killed the respawn could be one of the three, so eventually all thats left are the magelords and battlemasters ><
