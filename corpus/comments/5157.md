# Subject: "Stupid comments"
Honestly, I was reading this and it was the last straw..All you have to say is "I'm a level xx rogue" and immediately we all know you stealthed in got whatever and stealthed out, you don't have to say it! In addition to that, people use these comment boxes for aid in the quest; such as, "kill the mobs on the left, there are few and then you can get X item." How does saying "Hey I just stealthed in there, got the chest, stealthed out" help anyone? It doesn't! So stop saying it! | Location: 35, 59 | Subject: "<Blank>"

it's around the back, you'll see a little pond of green sludge.Â  it's not inside that cave | Subject: "Location"
For Cosmos users it's 35,60. It's not labeled when you get there. You have to right click on the canteen at this green pool and then it "unlocks" the sample. | Subject: "Two very similar quests"
Make sure you're using the correct container to gather it. There are two very similar quests, both where you gather liquid from a moonwell. Make sure you're using the right container at the right moonwell. | Subject: "Water Location"
