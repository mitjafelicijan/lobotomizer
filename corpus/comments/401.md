Very difficult quest indeed.
You actually have to talk to Sirra AGAIN! Zomg zomg.
Lucky for you the Thottbot guide exists.

1. Talk to Sirra to accept the quest (he is in Darkshire Town Hall at 72.47).

2. Talk to him AGAIN to finnish it.

PS. I'm really bored

This is tough, after speaking to him the first time you must wait 2 or 3 seconds, and then complete the quest.

I was lucky enough to complete it without failing, but for others here are some tips on what you could do while wait for this horribly long quest to finish.

1. Take a few steps left or right, and move back again.
2. Switch 2 items around in your inventory.
3. Say 'lol'
4. Write a short novel of 2 or 3 words.
5. Compose a very short song.
6. Scratch your nose (not too hard)

Hope this helps. | Subject: "Experience"
