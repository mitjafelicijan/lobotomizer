# Quest URL: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=9179
# Don't know if this bug has been fixed, but in mid 2006, this happened to me: When turning in the required 3 plate chests, if you are wearing the Imperial Plate with an enchant on it, make sure to leave it in the bank. Upon quest completion, I was left with a naked torso and an extra piece in my pack. Fortunately, I only lost a rugged leather armor patch! | Subject: "Materials"
