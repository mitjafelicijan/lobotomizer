You can find the Root Samples with the other plants you find in Barrens. When you open the lootbox of any plant in Barrens you will get a sample as extra. | Need to have herbalism to get this quest, not sure what skill level needed.

Root Sample can be found in any herb patch. | Subject: "i found them on..."
i found them on every plant that i found in the barrens, farely easy quest | Subject: "No Specific Location"
Just to clarify, as the quest description itself is not all that clear.

To do this quest you have to already be a herbalist, and basically you run around gathering herbs like normal, but while the quest is active, you will receive a bonus item "Root Sample" when you are gathering.

I found the root sample on anything I gathered (briarthorn, silverleaf, earthroot, etc.)

Hope that helps! | Subject: "Herbalism min"
I could not pick up this quest at Herbalism 37.Â  Came back at Herbalism 50, lvl 10 and could pick it up.
