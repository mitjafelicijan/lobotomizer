When facing the boss' house, turn right and there is a small cavern at the end of the path.Â  This quest is inside. | Welcome, young Tauren, to the first step in the vast plains of Mulgore and Azeroth beyond! I've paused to just post a small list of quests you should be sure to pick up before venturing into the Brambleblade Ravine area...

- Rite of Strength: Collect the belts off of the Quillboars inside the ravine. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=757)

- The Battleboars: Kill these piggies in the clearing in front of the ravine for their meat and snouts. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=780)

- Break Sharptusk!: Master piggie can be found in a central clearing in a tent. Clear his minions and proceed in for his head. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3376)

* Shaman: The Quillboar shaman within provide the salve you need for your Call of Earth quest. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1519)

My post is quite vague, but it's merely a set of guidelines. Feel free to act as you wish. After all, I am not you, you are you! Have fun, and may you have the Earthmother's blessing.
