This quest is very easy. I completed it with my level 4 mage. I accidently stumbled across an easier way to complete it. As soon as you enter the cave, if you take the path to the right instead of the left, you will eventually come to a cliff. The level 5 guy is right below you, you are standing right above him. Don't bother trying to attack him from the cliff, i tried and every single shot was evaded. But if you jump down, you only have to fight him and 1 other troll. Focus on the level 5 first, and once he dies the other troll is easy to finish. My mage only had 87 health to begin with, i think i had a little under 20 health when i was done. Was very easy, make sure you have full health/mana before and after you do it. And then after just work your way to the exit, killing the trolls 1 by 1. Take the right side out to exit also.

This was an enjoyable quest. I agree w/ above comments that the bad guys were spaced far enough apart that you could pick them off one at a time w/o a gang bang. Also, the coords are right on...31,80.Â  Right click on the lvl 5 bad dude & he drops the journal like a hot potatoe, once you get the correct quest! Over all, I leveled to 6 w/ my gnome warrior, without sweatin' it. Good luck to my fellow noobs & enjoy!
