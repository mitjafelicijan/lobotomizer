# Subject: "Where to find crabs"
For those of you who do not have cosmos you can find reef crawlers and encrusted tide crawlers south to southwest of Auberdine on the beach.  I believe it is considered twilight shore.  It is way down the beach way past Ameth 'Aran  At level 17 I killed them easily by myself in bear form.  They are between lvl 16 - 18.  Good luck! | Subject: "<Blank>"
at about 49,22 - 51,22 | You can found those "Reef Crawlers" at 45.20 (for my friends with coords), and for those without coords it's under the bridge, when you head to "Ruins of Mathystra" . I hope this will be helpfull to you friends. Have fun....cya in wow ! ;) | Drop rate is atrocious.

I have a level 60 and a bunch of alts who have done this quest, and this time around I acctually read the quest, did anyone else notice the Forest Gump reference? Bubba Gump Shrimp, and the NPC is named Glubber Blumb, and he talks about all the ways to prepare the crabs like Bubba talks about the shrimp. haha that rocks!
