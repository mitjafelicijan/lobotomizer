Pretty much where the following three paths intersect youll find him.
1) west of Silverwind retreat
2) north of Talondeep mine exit from Stonetalon
3) south of that tiny river east of Astrananar

Where those 3 points intersect you will find the bear wandering around.  I'd post the /tloc but its not updated right now to the new patch. 

Oh, and he was 25 not 24. | Subject: "Here is a pic of him"
