1. Get some E.C.A.C from the machine right next to quest giver.

2. go south from Ratchet until u reach the first ship.

3. walk on to the ship on the ships pointy front thingy.

4. go to the second level of the ship, in the farthest room towards the shore.

5. stand between to chests and perfom Pick Lock on these, swithching from chest to chest (this way it doesnt matter when ur affected by Frost Nova and Rat-curse. I went from skill 1 to 100 in about 15 min.

6. go to the bottom lvl of the ship and pick the lock on the chest.

7. use E.C.A.C on polly and kill him as he turns into a small lvl 18 parrot. (good idea to put the E.C.A.C in ur action bar)

8. turn in quest.

--------
Contempt lvl 20 UD Rouge - Frostwhisper
Artemisdk lvl 60 NE Rouge - Kor�gal
-------- | 1. Get Lockpicking tools and ECAC from the robot next to the quest giver.

2. travel south into the merchant coast, and board the ship at coord :64,45 - you can board from the front tip

3. on the first level down you can skill up your lockpicking to 5xlvl (ex. 17x5= 85)

3a. tip: find a spot where you can loot two or three footlockers, that way you don't have to move. don't worry about getting rat nova'd or frost nova'd

4. on the second level down open the chest, it will be empty, once you open it, polly will spawn, stealth and use your ECAC on polly, put ECAC into your hot bar. then defeat polly and loot treasure.

5. DO NOT loot the chest again, as polly will repsawn and KILL you. | Subject: "Stealth required when facing big ass Polly"
Make sure your lockpicking skill is at 85 by picking the four lockboxes upstairs, then go downstairs and pick the lock of the jewel.  When the giant lvl 50 Polly comes out, Stealth first before you give him a cracker, because Polly does want a cracker, but if he sees you, he'll bite your head off.  Stealth so he doesn't see you, get near him, stuff his face, and then he'll transform into midget Polly... then kick his ass and loot.  Have fun. | Subject: "Quest Descrption"
Head south of ratchet and look for the ship the first ship right next to the coast. you will need to jump on the point of the boat to gain entrance to the deck. On the second level, there are 4 locked chests you could pick (2 were trapped, 1 empty, and one had 2 mutilated rat carcasses). Head to the bottom level and pick the chest. A fight with a huge parrot (yes, a parrot) will begin. Use the ECAC (quest item given by robot next to Wrenix) to shrink the parrot to normal size. He's level 18. Loot him to quet the southsea treasure. Your quest reward, thistle tea, is wonderful. BTW: completed quest easily w/lvl 18 troll rogue

Currently you have to attack the big parrot and drag him up the stairs one level. Then you can right click on the ECAC and the parrot will shrink.

The big parrot is a badass, so you have to do it quickly. He can't attack you until you get up one flight of stairs though, so don't panic. | Subject: "Southsea Treasure"
1. First , need take a E.C.A.C from robot near quest giver.
2. Then Need move to 64.45 . 64.45 is in the ship .
3. In the ship was a box . It name is The Jewel of the Southsea .
4. Then need one time open The Jewel of the Southsea . And in the minute there come a bird lvl 50.
5. Then need target bird and give she E.C.A.C . In the 2 seconds she's level will be demoted to 18 level and bird will be maked smaller .
6. Need to kill that bird and take from she Southsea Treasure.
7. Need move back to Ratchet for your revard ^^ .
>This is end , good luck . Remember name of the Box< | Subject: "Darnit Polly, take the frickin' cracker!"
I tried this three times, and third time was the charm... once I figured it out!  Here's how you do it - my lockpicking on the box was orange, so I didn't have much trouble opening it.  Have your bag with the cracker in it open and be ready to click on it so you're not fumbling around after Polly spawns.  After you finish picking the lock, stealth.  Sneak to where you can target Polly, then right click on the cracker in your bag.  This'll do the transformation and you can easily kill the parrot and get the quest piece then!  I tried attacking the big Polly and trying to trade the cracker with it at first... yeah, don't do that, it doesn't work.  Right click on that sucker! ;)

the location of the ship is 64,45 for you who have coordinates | Subject: "TIPS"
DO NOT open the chest more than once that summons the parrot...because the parrot will come AGAIN and you only have ONE cracker...so...basically, you're toast if you do. Also, you CAN STILL open the lockboxes when you are a rat.

Also, when you are lvling your lockpicking skill with the chests in there...a faster way is to stand so that theres a chest in front of you, one to the left of you and one to the right of you...then you never have to move around the room to open the boxes...you can just stay in that one spot and open those 3 in front of you over and over. They reappear fast. (also, by doing this, when you get stuck in an ice trap, it wont matter).

Also, your lockpicking skill will only go as high as your characters level x5. Soo, if I was lvl 17, that would be 17x5=85, so I could only get a max lockpicking skill of 85 while I'm at level 17 on my rogue. So therefore, you can only increase your lockpicking as your character level increases as well. Good luck. | Don't forget to TRAIN Pick Locks from the rogue trainer in org before you go. Otherwise you will be standing there with thieves tool and lockboxes and nothing to do.
