# Quest ID: 8201
# Quest Title: A Collection of Heads
# Quest URL: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8201
# Actually, not sure if this is a bug or not, but it would seem that you can loot the head off any aspect. Meaning if you kill the snake boss on 5 seperate resets, you can finish this quest.

We dropped all the aspects in one night and I forgot to loot the head off the Panther. The next night when we got a reset instance, I looted the final head off the snake.

Easy quest, easy rep. | This quest is obtained on a little island in the northwest of Stranglethorn vale. you must collect the heads of each boss in Zul'grub and then string them together with the sacred cord that the quest giver gives you. the quest starts and ends at the same person named Exzhal. | Contrary to what you'd expect, you can actually share this quest on Classic. You will get the cord in your inventory when you accept the quest.
Just make sure to do it before the first boss to get the belt in one run!
