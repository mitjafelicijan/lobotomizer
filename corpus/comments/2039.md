Found him at 63,48. | Bingles is on the Eastern side of the Loch in Loch Modan. If you're looking at the map, he's just about even with the lettering "Loch".

If you have add-ons like Cosmos, or Titan Panel, his coordinates are 63,47. | Subject: "Coords"
I found Bingles at 63,47.

His crashed vehicle is in the water, so as long as you follow the east coast of the lake you will run into him. | Subject: "Found..."
I just found Bingles about 25 ft. from his crashed plane.Â  The plane is located on the east side of The Loch where the water goes the farthest inland...
