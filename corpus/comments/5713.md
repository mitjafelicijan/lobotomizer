You get 3 waves of attackers. First wave is two lv14s. Second wave is three lv14s. Last is a lv16. Wait around for each wave to come. Last wave Sentinal Aynasha will run out of arrows and won't help you. Another minute and she will send you to Onaeya. Shes located at 45:90. | she takes ages to finish, even if you kill all the mobs, just wait for the quest complete text. | She's hidden in the hills, sort of difficult to find. 3 waves spawn upon accepting the quest, the first with 2 furbolgs, the second with 3, and the last wave with the named furbolg "boss." | You don't have to actually "escort" this NPC. You just defend the friendly NPC against a few waves, then the quest is "complete", and you turn it in in Ashenvale. | She has some "unique" audio-only voice lines. I assume they're from night elf units in one of the Warcraft RTS games.
"Cry, Havoc."
"All to easy."
