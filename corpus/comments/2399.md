# Quest ID: 2399
# Quest Title: The Sprouted Fronds
# Quest URL: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=2399
# This quest is somewhat bugged. Upon turning in the pre-quest The Shimmering Frond, Denalan will run over to his planter and plant some seeds. Three sprouts will spring, and you need to click one of them for the quest. The problem is that the moment someone else turns in a quest to Denalan, it removes everything else in the planter and instead sets it to the stage that person is in the chain.

The only remedy is to wait for someone else to turn in the pre-quest and get one of the three sprouts before they despawn. | Had to wait for another person to make him plant a seed. My seed didn't spawn any Sprouted Frond. | Still bugged in 2023.

Hang out. Wait til someone else turns in the same quest. Click the fronds and have your complete-quest-quickly macro ready.
