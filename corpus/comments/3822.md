# He wanders around the Ogre area. First check the cave at the foot of the hill, then walk over to your left and around to the cave on the other side. You'll run into him in either of the 2 caves or in between them. | And no one talks about poor troll guy who lost her girlfriend. Do you even read quests? You are like robots, always talking about how much xp and rep points quests give. ;/ | Subject: "multiple locations"
I have done this quest at least twice and found him in different caves. The second time I did the quest he was exactly where EvilGrinUK described, but someone killed him before I did. I waited for him to respawn, hoping he would respawn in the same spot, but he did not. He respawned in the same cave, but in a different location ... way in the back. The first time I found him he was in the cave on the opposite side of the mountain. You can use a macro "/target Krom" to help. Respawn time is your typical 5 minutes, or there abouts.
