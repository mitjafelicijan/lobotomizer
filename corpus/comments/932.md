# You can find the entrance to the cave with the coordinates 54, 52. Melenas is a level 8 Satyr that is just inside up on a ledge. There are many Grells inside the cave, so get a party if you are around level 6 and don't want a lot of hardship. | Subject: "Even easier now"
If you're a first-time player, this quest will certainly cause a lot of pain. I came back to do it as a 12 druid (my first character) and it was still mildly challenging even then. The greatest challenge is the sheer number of Grells inhabiting the place � getting anywhere to explore the cave is a challenge for anyone under level 8 or so.
In this cave, there are two "major" spawns � Melenas and Threggil.
Melenas the level 8 satyr is up on one of the ledges � yes, there are actually two ledges, nearly identical to each other. Go figure. It's not true that he keeps spawning on different places, it's just that the whole cave is really, really confusing � until you memorize it. Just go in, and after the 90 degree turn to the left, go right, and keep to the right wall. The tunnel will start turning left, and you will end up in a chamber...If I do remember correctly (it's been such a long time) you want to turn right, and then juke left at the first turn � don't keep on going, it'll just put you on the wrong ledge. Melenas is like the purloined letter � in plain sight. He's just way up there in the haze with his accomplice. First, kill the two blue Grells, and then take out Melenas' bo9dyguard, and finally Melenas. Melenas transforms into a Nightsaber-like beast after you hit it. You can jump off the ledge into the Grell welcoming party down below in the first (or was it second?) chamber.
While you're in there...Threggil is a level 6 rare-spawn that runs around the first chamber � the one that you go into if you keep walking forward after the first turn. Threggil has a nearly-guaranteed drop, the Keen Machete (2.5 DPS main hand sword, if you are so inclined to find out). Be aware that you will most likely get one or two adds, since all the Grells are placed very regularly throughout the chamber.
I tried soloing this as a level 5 (level 5 for the most part, took out Melenas after I hit 6) rogue, and although the Grell are annoyingly perceptive, I was able to kill Melenas after two ungraceful deaths � one after killing the two blue-colored Grells and one after killing Melenas' accomplice Grell. I don't know if it's been confirmed or not, but I didn't seem to be able to even hurt the satyr unless I took out his Grell-servant. *sigh* Wasted two pots and three bandages for some cruddy XP and rewards...Say...If I can do this at level 6 (No, half the time I wasn't in stealth and I was usually handling two level 7s at once) it really shouldn't be a problem for most of you � and I am definitely not a very good WoW player. | Subject: "EZ quest for level 8"
