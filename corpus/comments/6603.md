If you already picked up the quest Threat of the Winterfall, before going to Everlook, then you can not get this quest. Just so you don't go running around trying to find this quest if you already accepted the followup. | Donova Snowden is at 31,45. | Subject: "its easy to get a coordinates addon"
I always hear people on here saying they don't have cosmos so they don't have coordinates.  You don't need cosmos at all. 

Go to curse-gaming.com or ui.worldofwar.net and there are tons of addons that are easy to install that will give you coordinates.  It makes alot of the game much easier.
