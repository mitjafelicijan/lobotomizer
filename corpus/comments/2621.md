- Demon's Blood trinket (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=3720/yeti-fur)
- Necklace of Sanctuary (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=7755/flintrock-shoulders)

Besides those 3 items you get the trinket from Heroes of Old quest AND the weapon that Galvan forged in The Formation of Felbane.

As a lvl 59 warlock i soloed everything till step 19. You need a full party to do 19 and 20. | Subject: "Great xp!"
My wife and I took a crack at this quest chain. We got up to step 16 or 17 in one night and netted 90k xp for the work. Best night of xp by far for us!

I'd highly recommend this chain for anyone trying to make that last push to lvl 60. For alliance it starts in Nethergard Keep. There's a high elf at the top of the main tower who kicks it off.
