# Subject: "This is where I find the croc with the amulet:"
Ok, so it seems like the croc is all over the place... west from the house or somewhere south from the bridge.  I've done the quest at least 6 times now and here's what I can say definitively about which croc drops the amulet:

1. It does not look special in any way.
2. It is not named special in any way.
3. It is not a certain level.
4. It does not have an exact location.

Since it seems to be a quasi-random drop, here is how I find it with a minimum of grinding:

1. I always hunt southward from the Durotar/Barrens bridge.
2. I only need to go as far south as the "house" that is on the western bank  of the river.  This is the "house" with the stables outside of it.  Peons roam the grounds.
3. I have not found it any further south than this.
4. I may have to make multiple swings through this track of the river, but usually not more than once.

In contrast, I have never once had it drop north of the  bridge after several hours of hunting.

Mine also dropped off a corrupted crocolisk, which was yellow in color instead of the normal greyish. It was probably due west of the lady that gives you this, about even with the southern part of the thunder hills. | Subject: "Kron's Amulet"
Got mine from the 4th croc. It was just an ordinary one, so it must be random.
