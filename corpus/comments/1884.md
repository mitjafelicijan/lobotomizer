1 : 69,84
2 : 68,82
3 : 67,83
4 : 67,86 | The Ju-Ju heaps are piles of skulls located in Zalazane's Island. There are two in the two huts next to Zalazane, and quite a few more to the north of his encampment in the other huts. | For anyone else, like me, who sees the skull piles on the ground and gets frustrated that they're not clickable and begins to wonder if something is wrong... it's the skull piles INSIDE the huts, not the skull piles OUTSIDE the huts. *facepalm*
