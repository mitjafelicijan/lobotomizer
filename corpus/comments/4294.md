# Quest ID: 4294
# Quest Title: ... and a Batch of Ooze
# Quest URL: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4294
# Subject: "test all"
Just a hint:

test all your samples before ending the quest.
E.g. imagine you have 20 samples and after testing 15 of them you have your 5 questitems. If you now end the quest you cannot test the remaining 5 samples because the testset is inactive.
So you have to drop the remaining samples.
But if you test all you may get some items which can be sold. | All the oozes and slimes I encountered had 100% drop rate for the samples. I gathered 20, just to be on the safe side, and had more than enough.

Back in UC, there are two testing bowls on the table. Use the green one for the Un'Goro samples, and the red one for the Felwood samples. | Subject: "<Blank>"
Took me 20 samples to get 5 pure ones. I'd get 20-30 to be safe. | Subject: "<Blank>"
I've got both the Felwood and Un'goro quests.  It's not bugged.  One bowl at the chemist's table in UC is for Felwood and the other is for Un'Goro.  I didn't have to bank anything.

You'll need 50 for the Un'goro quest to be safe.  You'll probably not use this many, but if you have this many it'll save you the trip back.  The worst I got was 1:10.

----- UPDATE -----
I ended out needing 32 samples to complete this quest.  Use that info as you will.
