the swamp talker is in stagalbog cave or /tloc 65,77.
once you are in the cave go right and there he should be.
lvl 55 he summons one mob at a time lvl 40.
he should be easy to kill | Subject: "<Blank>"
Gotta love how this whole tragedy is based on the fact that not one of the soldiers at the outpost could be bothered to make the 30 second walk to Stonard and actually ask where the orders were. Thrall maybe wise but his honourable heroes are somewhat lacking. | Cave begins at 66,75. Murlocs are level 43 - 45. Swamp talker is surrounded by 2-3 Murlocs. Swamp Talker is in the room in the back of the cave (62,89) and level 50. | Subject: "Start."
Edit: nvm, I have no clue apparently.

Just keep going right and you'll find him surrounded of murlocs.

Cave entrance is in SOS 65,76 | Subject: "joo joo vittu"
