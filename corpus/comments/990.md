# Quest ID: 990
# Quest Title: Trek to Ashenvale

# Blizzard has acknowledged that the quest giver is a bit bugged. I was able to layer hop to a layer where Sentinel Selarin was not there. Once somebody turned in The Blackwood Corrupted, she came running in, spoke her dialogue and offered the quest.
Last edited by KovuTheHusky on 2019/09/11 | As of "Classic", Sentinel Selarin is in-game, and offers this quest after one finishes the Volcor escort quests at Terenthis. Ideally, she runs in, talks with Terenthis and soon after their RP is done, she offers anyone eligible this quest (for several minutes). However, if you are eligible, yet she is standing next to Terenthis but not offering any interaction, she is simply bugged and you need a server reset to "fix" her. After this, you may need someone else to finish their quest for her to re-spawn. Also, completing quests in Ashenvale does not remove this breadcrumb quest, so one can still return and do it afterward for the sake of completionism.

You can start the next quest (Raene's Cleansing in Ashenvale) without getting this one.
