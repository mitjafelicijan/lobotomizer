# The Fresh Threshadon Corpse can be found at 68, 57, surrounded by hordes of lvl 50-51 raptors. And I do mean HORDES. Getting the item you need requires a 5-second "use" of the corpse, so you need to clear everything neraby out first, or have someone pull everything away. Enjoy. I suggest waiting until you can safely dispose of the raptors, or reroll a hunter. | Subject: "...here ya go!"

The carcass is, obviously, at the red dot! good luck! | Subject: "<Blank>"
68.57 - Correct ! | Subject: "Location for non-cosmos users"
For non-cosmos users, here is where I found the carcass. Follow the stream north from the Tanaris zone-in. Take the first branch to the right following the main stream. At the next branch, go left. There is a small pond here (the right branch makes a half circle back to the pond). Follow around the pond until you are at the western most tip (it looks a little like a birds beak pointing west). Go directly west from here and you should see the carcass almost immediately. Its about halfway between the next pond over. Hope this helps. | Subject: "Quest giver location"
