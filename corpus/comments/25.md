48,69 Theres a little structure, it appears as a blue dot on the radar, just walk under it. | The gazebo is at 48,69. | Coordinates for the lake is 52,71. | Subject: "info"
This quest is a two part quest. First is the gazebo and the second is killing. The loc of Mystal Lake is 47,70. That loc is the island in which the gazebo sits on. On that island are 6 water elementals. Merciless bastards. To explore the gazebo you need to run into it and stand in the glowing light. After that, even prior, you need to kill the 12 mobs listed in the quest.

My results:
You gain 2000 experience.
Your reputation with Orgrimmar has increased.
