to make enough robes for this quest, you need no less than 200 Runecloth

just so no one bothers to say "no way thats right" here is the math

8 Runecloth Robe times 5 Bolt of Runecloth X 5 Runecloth per bolt = 200

of course, you also need 8 Ironweb Spider Silk and 8 Rune Thread, 1 of each of those two items for each Runecloth Robe

so altogether, thats 200 Runecloth, 8 Ironweb Spider Silk, and 8 Rune Thread to gather for this Craftsman's Writ, and you will also need a tailor to make the robes. they will need at least 260 skill in tailoring, and if they do have the skill but not the pattern, then look for Darnall in the Moonglade, in Nighthaven, the local town, and yes, it is neutral.

i just thought it was past time someone posted something like this | Subject: "Materials"
Grand Total Raw Materials:
200x Runecloth
