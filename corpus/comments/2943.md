After this quest I got the quest "The Stave of Equinex". | Subject: "The next quest"
Yes I got the staff of equinex quest too (lvl 47 warrior) and it took me to some ruins north(west) of Feralas just west of the twin Colossals.  Lots of those Harpy types to fight, had to collect 4 flames from the area, then click on the staff I was given to arm it and then click on the monolith in the ruins.  Did it on my own, even though the harpys were lvl 48's to 50's.  Took me about an hour to finish.
