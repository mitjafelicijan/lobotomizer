# Take note that you MUST be hated with Booty Bay in order to get this quest. There is a bug/exploit you can do to get to Friendly with Bloodsail and still be friendly with Booty Bay, but you will be unable to get this quest.

Dont waste your time on the exploit. But get this hat, its very worth it for the novelty! Dont be afraid of goblin rep. You can reobtain that within hours with just about 200 gold by buying cloth and turning it in (or farm instances for it)

YARR MATEYS!
