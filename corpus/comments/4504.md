# You can avoid the "Black Sludge" debuff by turning and running as soon as they start casting, its a long cast and a short range, plus unless you can remove disease 54% slower attack is a huge pain. There are lower mobs then the 52-54 ones, if you go farther east, there are more spread out tar-pools with 50-52 mobs. | Subject: "Super Sticky Reward"
Reward for completing was: 1g 65s and 5450 exp | Subject: "Pain in the Ass"
This quest is a pain in the ass.
At first I went to the first location provided and no drops.
Then I went to another one and nothing at all.
I decided to go South and killed two creepers and got 2/2 for the drop.

The location I was at was 47,33.

My drop rate was:
Tar Beast 13%
Tar Creeper 11%

I got more from the Creepers then Beast though.
Just hang around there and wait for them to respawn and you'll be done in 1/2 hour.
