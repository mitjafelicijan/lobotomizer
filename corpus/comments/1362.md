I did guest this way: take wind rider sun rock retreat or walk to stonetalon mountains then go the charred vale. Then go south of charred vale until you see way to desolace, (coords: 30,77). Welcome desolace(monster levels here are 30-38), now proseed to these coords 56,60 complate guest 650xp. (if dont have any coords mod yet get it here http://www.curse-gaming.com/) | Subject: "Needed: Messenger-boy to Desolace"
If you're going Desolace / Ghost Walker Post, go to Freewind Post first and pick up the quest from a Tauren standing near the Freewind Post windrider that is (you guessed it) carrying a message to Ghost Walker Post (an intro to Desolace from Thousand Needles). (I'm personally not a fan of the messenger-boy quests, but I understand their place in the game.)
While you're there, as someone has already said, tiptoe on down to Shadowprey Village and get the windrider there. If you're a cook, visit Wulan for the Expert Cookbook while you're in Shadowprey Village (bring 1g).
Weird, though -- I couldn't find a cooking fire in the Expert Cook's town. Maybe I was just tired and cross-eyed...
