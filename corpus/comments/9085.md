How to kill them:
1-find a necronic shard (near the flying necropolis)
2-kill LOTS of undeads: this will damage the shard
3-when the shard will have 0 HP, 4 summoner will happear to repair it
4-use 8 Necronic runes to stop the ritual of one of the summoners: this will evoke the Shadow
5-kill the shadow
Tip: As all the mobs, u must be the first one attacking the shadow to complete the quest. So gather a grp of 5 ppl and kill it: prolly the place will be full of players but u and they cant share the killing of a shadow of doom. If u are alone prolly some1 will attack the shadow before u...
