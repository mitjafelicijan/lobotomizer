Here are my findings on this quest at level 44:

Killing location:
Lower Wilds / Woodpaw Hills
Around 76,54

Target:
Woodpaw Trapper (lvl 41-42)
Woodpaw Brute (lvl 41-42)
Woodpaw Mongrel (lvl 40-41)

Drop rate:
Woodpaw Trapper: 64% (11 kills for 7 manes)
Woodpaw Brute: 25% (8 kills for 2 manes)
Woodpaw Mongrel: 13% (8 kills for 1 mane)

Rewards:
~204 XP per kill, 2550 XP Quest Reward, 150 Thunder Bluff Reputation and 45 Silver - at 75,42.

Comments:
Simply roam around the given location and keep killing the Woodpaws until you have all the needed manes. Also, as you can see the Trappers have the highest droprate and the Mongrels the lowest, thus you should try to avoid fighting Mongrols - fairly easy.

~ DeathWise | A good spot for the Woodpaw is 69, 54. Enjoy :) | Subject: "Where:"
These are SW of the sity, not too far away at all. Maybe a 50% drop rate. | Subject: "Who to kill..."
I'll just like to add that any woodpaw will do, they all drop the manes needed for the quest. Killing the level 40 to 42 will just make it easier for yourself.

So, Mongrels, Trappers, Brutes, Reavers and MysticsÂ  will all do.

Don't give up, I got my first mane on the 15th kill, so the drop rate -is- low!
