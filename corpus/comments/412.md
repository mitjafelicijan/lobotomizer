Hi, I've attempted to do this quest, I collected both sets of 8 parts, the restabilization cogs and the gyromechanic gears. I ran back to Razzle and there's no mark over his head and he doesn't respond to clicks. Is this quest currently working? Thanks ahead of time for help and information. | From Brewnall Village, you'll find them just a hint North West from there. Almost due West of the lake.

The Leper Gnomes like to run, which will typically mean that they come back with a friend, so do what you can to kill them before they get too far. Also, they like to hit you with "Decayed Strength", which reduces your strength by 2.

For those with Cosmos, or Titan Panel and like coordinates, I started finding Leper Gnomes around 26,43 approaching from the South.

After you complete the quest, be sure to stand back and watch Razzle Sprysprocket's invention kick into action. It's pretty funny.
