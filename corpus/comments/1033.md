# In order to find this lake, simply follow the road south out of astranaar. Stick to the main road (which will turn and start heading east) until you come to the beginning of a stream that heads to the north. There will be a dirt path to the west of this stream also heading north. Follow this path/stream all the way north until you come to Iris Lake. | Subject: "Location"
