Chromie is a dragon, in gnome form, who is in the inn in Andorhol. If you have reached this quest, you will already have gone to see her, as this chain is linked with another, starting in the intact building in Sorrow Hill. She is the person who gives recipes or actually makes breastplates of the chromatic flight or something, amazing epic gear.
