44:10 is the general area of the camp that you need.
dont bother going in the towers and caves though... | Be sure to pick up the 'Bad Medicine' quest when you're doing this one. The fighters and medicine men are all at the same camp. | Subject: "Quest Location"
Hey guys,

The location to find Kurzen's Compound is 43.9, this will put you in front of the compound with the Jungle fighters on the right side of the Ruins (the East) and the Medicine Man to the left of the ruins (West). I attacked a Medicine man to see the accuracy of these rezz claims and when i attacked him with Pet (target was lvl 32) he died quite quickly. My character is a 34 NE Hunter and my pet is a 33 Bear. Have fun on this quest, its quite easy. I have also provided a screenshot for you for visual reference.

PS: Just before i finish, DO NOT go inside the ruins u see, there is a mob of lvl 35 commando's inside, i just found out the hard way.

PPS: right so now i know what you mean, that the medicine man heals the jungle fighter, i will try to separate them to avoid them being rezzed. will let ya know if it worked.
