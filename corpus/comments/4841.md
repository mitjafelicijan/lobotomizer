41,41 | COORDINATES: 48, 43

I headed directly north of Freewind Post and found of camp of Galak Scouts, Wranglers and Windchasers. Theyre in a camp along the northern barrier of the map. Wranglers and Windchasers were plentiful while Scouts were a little rarer.

Theyre pretty well spaced out so you can easily move west through the camp slaughtering as you go.

The windchasers have the ability to heal themselves and other centaurs so you may want to focus on these first. They also have a whirlwind spell which will render you immobile so be cautious.

The wrangles have the ability to net you so be wary of that.

I had the best luck finding scouts by looking at the entrances/exits to the camp. Scouts seem to serve as the guards for the camp. | Subject: "please...."
It's not a super secret coord system.. It's just the % over and down on the zone.

for example:
41, 41 = 41% down from the top of the 1k needles map, and 41% right from the left edge of that map (the map you see when you press M). Yes, it's (X,Y) from middle school.

Also, blizzard provides those coords, the mods just show them visibly. There are tons of mods that do it. Some ones with small footprints imho are titanbar or fubar (google it or search wowinterface.com). Just get a location plugin for one of those mods (plugins are reallys imple, you don't even have to put them in 1 folder, just put the folders that you download into [Insert your harddrive and wow install destination, by default C:/Program Files]/World of Warcraft/Interface/Addons/ folder.

Got it? | Subject: "quest works fine"
