# Have to kill Scorpid Reavers for the best drop rate. Best location I've found is 72,73 around a broken down wagon, a tent and some other junk on the ground.

Easy soloed as 32 Dwarf Warrior. | Subject: "LOW drop rate"
I have killed over 30 of them as well, with only 1 drop. | Subject: "go to tloc 72,73 they all drop there"
nvm they all drop at there *chilling* place... 72,73
