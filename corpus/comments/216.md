This one is easy to do. Just head east from where you got the quest and stay on the road toward Astranaar. Before you get to Astranaar you make a left and go north. Soon you'll see plenty of Thistlefurs to kill.

My results:
You gain 1950 experience.
Your reputation with Orgrimmar has increased.
Reveived 17 Silver.
