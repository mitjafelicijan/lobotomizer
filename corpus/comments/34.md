He spawns at exactly 15,49

For those who don't have cosmos or some loc mod for their game, go directly west of where you get the quest, through her garden and down the hill a bit.

This is an incredibly easy solo quest as there is nothing else around Bellygrub, so it's just you and him.Â  He's a lvl 24.

Note: Bellygrub has a SLOW repop, so if you don't find him immediatly, be patient and allow him to repop.
