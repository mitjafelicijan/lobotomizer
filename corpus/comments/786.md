The quest says the plans are carried by a leader at each outpost type place.  But as said earlier they're laying on the ground at each camp.

You don't need the coordinates at all,  If you just walk west from Sen'jin village into Kolkar Crag,  you'll find 3 cubby holes,  each with their own tents,  and each one has plans laying on the ground to destroy.

If you see some tents,  then you're at one of the posts.  Only 3 and very close to each other.  The first one is right on your left as you enter the crag, other two are just slightly further in..  Can't missem really.

But confused me because I was looking for leaders at each site when indeed the plans lay on the ground!
