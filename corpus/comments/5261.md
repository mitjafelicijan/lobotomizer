Server - Im playing on private servers because i dont have the money to buy the real game (im only 13 :D), but soon I'll have. The name of the private server is Knights Legion WoW server (you can find it on Wowstatus.net). =)

About the private servers...
Latency: Depends on how many people plays. But usually its about 300-400. Very bad.
Population: 20-30 people online, always.
Bugs: It has few more bugs than bliz server, but its still playable.
-------------------------------------------------
I cant wait to get real WoW :).
