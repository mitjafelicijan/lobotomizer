# Subject: "Location"
The location is 28,6 . Its some hot serpent lady statue :) | try doing this together with https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1456
and https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=6161
all end at the same island | For those of you more interested in what you'll be summoning, it's this guy. It's simple enough though, the only ability he has is cleave, so it's just a matter of burning down his HP. Make sure you clear the adds in the area first. | Subject: "Make sure you use the gem before the statue."
It is possible to use the statue without using the gem.  This summons the boss but he won't drop the book.  Make sure you right-click on the gem and then click on the statue. | Subject: "experience"
3550 experience gained from this at level 36 | 28,7 Book of the Ancients | Subject: "Serpent Statue"
Keep in mind that once someone has summoned Lord Kragaru with the gem at the shrine, the statue disappears and the respawn takes a bit.
So if you can't find it at the North end of the isle behind the temple, just be patient. You shouldn't be waiting more than a couple of minutes. | Subject: "As lvl34 Paladin"
I got both the sceptre of light AND that Lord Kharag....or something at at lvl34. I'm a Paladin and these guys were "pretty" easy to solo except for the Naga lord... he was a tough one.

The naga lord who drops the book of the ancients can be found on the biggest island you can find NW o your map. But before you can kill him you need to put the gem in the statue which is at the top Northern portion of the island. After that he pops up and you can start bashing him.

The sceptre of light(prequest) can be found inside the thunder axe fotress compound in the watchtower on your left when you enter the compound.
