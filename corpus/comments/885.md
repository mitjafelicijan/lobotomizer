# Subject: "4 specially named beasts"
Latoka'Mani- a kodo (wooly) found directly north of CampT
Owatanka- a thunder lizzard (blue) found slightly southwest of CampT
Washte Pawne- a thunder hawk (red) found near Kuz below Feild of giants
Slithid Harvester- a crazy looking beetle thing (if u have played MMBN3 for the GBA, it looks suspiciously like the scuttlest enemies) foun on the right side of the field of giants if ur heading south.
if there any others i dont know bout em, but i know that they DO in fact give a permanent stat bonus. owatanka and lotoka'mani are easy kills, easily soloed, but Washte and the Harvester are near impossible to solo unless ur a higher lvl (wasthe is 25, the harvester is 24)
the harvest behaves much like a slithid swarmer and calls multiple minions who atacks so frquently its impossible to cast a spell. | Subject: "+2pts."
