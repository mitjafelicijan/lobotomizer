only thing that really sucks about this last quest is the walk from the graveyard. its about 15 minutes and by the time you return respawns have already claimed your corpse as their personal %^&*!. | You get the pages off of the following: (you need 5 total)

Then you get the cover from: (can be found inside the cave)

This gives you this (once combined):

The mine is far up in the NE corner of the Barrens and is clearly on the Map. The fastest way to here is to take the back exit from Orgrimmer. Running from Org only takes about 3 minutes. So South after you cross the bridge out of Org. You should see the mine on your map. Bear right around the mountain and you will come across the road. Follow the road up the hill. The mine is at the top.

You need to collect 5 missing pages from the manual first. You do this by killing mob around the mine.

Once you have the missing 5 pages, proceed to the mine, which is to the left of the tower. Copperplug is deep in the mine. Just keep going till you find him. I soloed this as a lvl 24 Rogue. If you are careful, you should be able to solo it level 22-24 without a problem. Level 20, you might want some help.

Once you have recovered the Manual, open your bags and right-click on the missing 5 pages, which will reconstruct the full manual. Now you can Hearth out and turn in the quest. If you plan on fighting your way out, be aware that most of the mob will have respawned. It is almost faster to just Hearth out and wait for your 1 hour cooldown than to try and fight your way out of this place.

Happy hunting. | Subject: "FYI"
So I didn't anything mentioned where you turn the quest in...so I walked around Org until I found him...just to help you out, he is in The Valley of Honor in Orn...76,25...Hope that helps.. | For those playing hardcore, don't try this mission until you are 5-6 levels up. Unfortunately for the samoplhlage cover you have to kill a boss in the mine and the mine is really full of enemies. At level 21 I risked too much.

Stay safe!
