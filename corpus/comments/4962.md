FAQs...

1. No, you cannot get both quests.

2. Yes, it does matter what quest you do, they both reward a staff and an offhand. If you chose the Felhound quest, both the rewards have +Shadow Damage. If you chose the Infernal quest, both the rewards have +Fire Damage.

3. Both of these quests are at Mannoroc Cavern in Desolace, East of Shadoyprey Village.

4. The Felhounds are called Mana Eaters and The Infernals are called Lesser Infernals.

5. The  Ruby is used just like Drain Life spell, but it dosent do any damage, so put enouogh DOTS up to kill em.

Ok..here's what's important, and what you need to know (disregard a lot of what is above..it's too confusing).
To capture the soul of a felhound...find a maneater at 52:67 in Desolace...and use the ruby in the same way that you use your Drain Soul. You need to be using the ruby as the mana eater dies, and you will gain the imprisoned felhound spirit, just like you gain a soul shard.

Head back to Ratchet and hand it in. | This one took me awhile to figure out, but you basically go to Desolace and steal a felhound's soul and your reward will be the following:
