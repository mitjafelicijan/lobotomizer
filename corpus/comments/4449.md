# The droprate of silk off the nearby dwarves is horrible. I suggest that you bring silk prior to getting this quest. If you decide to clear the camp over and over, don't forget about the second camp to the north along the road. Clear one camp then run back to the other and repeat the cycle for minimum downtime. | Didn't have any silk so I just took the pass (start coord 69,53 in Searing Gorge) over to the Badlands and killed about 12 Shadowforge Tunnelers (coords 53,34 at Hammertoe Dig site. Fast drops on silk. | Quickest place to get silk cloth quickly since you probably aren't still carrying it when you get to Searing Gorge is to ride back through Badlands to Angor Fortress and kill some high 30s dwarves. The droprate is decent enough. | Subject: "Caught!"
Go to 65,62 for finish quest. | Go kill 8 of those things there are only 5 of. | Subject: "What's up?"
I picked up this quest after releasing the guy who was in the outhouse. It let me get the quest , so I figure it will let me turn it in....I don't think so! I complete it and go back to the outhouse to turn it it and it won't let me : ( so, just in FYI, don't free the guy before you do this quest. Or it will be all for naught.
