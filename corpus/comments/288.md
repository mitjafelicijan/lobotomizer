# Subject: "it's still @ the inn"
If you go to the inn, and towards the back near the bar there is a small guy. (it's the same guy that you use to make it your inn). the trick is they hide it on the 2nd page :) | You can buy the drink from the innkeeper in town. Will lead to more quests for that area.
