This is outside of Blind Mary's House. It is probably better to run down here than all the way out to Raven Hill to do this quest because of the turn in. The respawn rate is pretty quick if you kill really fast. | The ideal quest to do alongside this would be the second part of the Night Watch chain.

The SouthWest portion of Raven Hill cemetary has lvl 24-25 horrors and fiends. They dropped at near 90% rate. Hardest part was finding them alive while others were harvesting.

Did this as lvl 33, for lower lvls watchÂ  out for the gang of gang robbers while you're running around, you'll need help if you spark them off, though the have nice chest at times. | Subject: "dont waste your time."
