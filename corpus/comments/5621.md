Go where the cooking trainer is.  Go Southwest past him, with the tall rock mound on your left.  If you follow the mound, you'll notice a sentinel kneeling down and facing a lake.  That is Sentinel Shaya.  Use Heal (Level 2) first and then Power Word: Fortitude next. She'll run off towards the lake if it works. | Subject: "Ignore that"
