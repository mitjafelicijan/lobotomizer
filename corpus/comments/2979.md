# you have to kill the "Gordunni Mage-Lord" for it. | Subject: "Wtf !!!"
Ok, after 2 hours of killing everything around the ruins where the mage-lords spawn, i started to count my kills :P
currently 236 mage-lords killed, and even more of all the others! gotten 2 lvls here only trying to get this orb lol, wtf?
this just cant be right, with 3.20% drop chance i should have gotten 1 each 32 mage-lords or so. so i should have gotten about 12-13 orbs so far :D but nada! but i did get 1 epic, and 4 blues, and tons of cash and xp... but still this is just stupid!
I can understand some bad luck, but this is just not right!
