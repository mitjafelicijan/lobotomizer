# Very simple quest. The raptor eggs are located on the Echo Islands just south of Sen'jin Village. You will see at least one raptor guarding an egg nest on every single island. | Subject: "location"
60.82
63.86
68.86
these are the correct locations to me

basically for who dont have cosmos:
go to eco island, one is on west side, one south and one on east side of the island | If you swim around the Islands south from Sen Jin Village, you will find raptors guarding their eggs. All you have to do is, kill the raptors (or sheep etc) and loot the eggs right behind them. NOTE: Not all raptors will have the eggs, some are just sitting there, but you will be able to find eggs in every island.
