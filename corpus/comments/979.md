She spawns right by the road at 63,59.  Pretty easy escort quest, no big battles, just level 57-59 owlbeasts. | Found her at 63, 59. | Subject: "tips"
Just finished this quest.  Basically, she goes around to each cave and starts casting a spell.  During this time, you can do whatever you want, but she won't move on until you light the torch she is infront of.  Use this time to heal/mana up. 
She also won't stop and attack anything thing inless she is attacked first.  I suggest letting her walk about 10 paces infront of you so the moonkin will attack her first.  Otherwise, she will keep on walking while you are lagging behind fighting moonkin. 
I did this as a 59 hunter, so it was rather easy.  I suggest being about 55ish to do this quest. | Subject: "Additional Quest"
Turning this in opened up the "Guardians of the Altar" quest.
