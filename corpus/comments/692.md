54, 86 Kill the Enraged Rock Elementals, which is literally up a path behind Theldurin! | You can obtain this quest at 37, but the mobs you have to kill are 42-43. Either wait and do this after leveling up a bit, or bring friends. My 39 warrior had trouble taking on just one of the elementals.

Also note that this are of elementals tends to get farmed, probably for elemental earth. Not sure why, as elemental earth is one of the cheapest elements I've seen in the AH. Anyways, you might be competing with farmers on this one. | Subject: "2CENTS"
