the cordnites are 58,35 :P | Subject: "Real Coords"
The Coordinates of the Decrepit Ferry itself is 55, 33. Once you reach those coordinates, keep running until you reach the lake. Swim until you reach the Dock and you will then see a boat over there with silver cascet like things in them. Go up the boat and right click and that will pick up a ring and begin another quest. The coordinates to reach the boat are 58,34. You must go to this boat to complete the series of quests. There should also be a guy on on the deck. Kill him. | Subject: "Boat on the shore."
Travel East right from the town and you'll find a lake, and a small pier down at the water. Off to the side you'll see a boat up on the shore, this is where you have to click on it and open the boat to find the "reason for the Scourge's Occupation". | 58, 34 (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=1593)
Find the "Corpse Laden Boat" by the docks.
