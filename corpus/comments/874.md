*NOTE: I've been told to go north of Ratchet, if you hear this, do not listen.

Go to Ratchet and stand at the dock. If you look at your map, you'll see just barely south of Ratchet, the shore makes an cresent moon shape curving inward west then back east for the end of the arc shape, making a point. Mahren is at this point, if you look at this location from the dock, you can barely make out the tip of the offwhite hut right of the palmtrees (with the hanging shark in front of it that you can't see from the dock). Really easy, jump off the dock and just swim there, there's level 19 and 18 Slimshell Mukura's in the water between Ratchet and her.
