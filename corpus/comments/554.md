I suspect this is one of many quests that are in place to lead you from A to B. Stormpike has several quests and I for one can say with great certainty coming here never crossed my mind, much less for a quest at 40. Call it a nudge in the right direction. | Subject: "<Blank>"
I brought this pergament to Stormpike and he told me it would take a while to decipher it, but he would give "a call" once it is done. 10-15 min later I got a yellow system message in the chat log telling me the deciphering was done, but no word from Stormpike, no letter in my mail and no nothing. Am I yet to low with lvl 41 to get it, or is there a bug/the end of this quest as for now? I noticed that the Historian Karnik, a guy near him, has a grey exclamation mark above his head, is this the (for me future) next step?

TIA for any clues
