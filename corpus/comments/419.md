# Pilot Hildelve is directly northwest of the questgiver at 79,36. You'll see a path that branches off to the left of the main road... the lost dwarf is a bloody mess at the end of the path, and Mangeclaw is in the valley behind him. | Subject: "<Blank>"
This corpse is located across from the quest giver in the same zone near a downed tree and a named bear you have to kill after you find the corpse. | Subject: "Reward"
My reward for this included a chain vest that was a moderate upgrade (I did this quest as a level 10 Human Paladin). | Subject: "<Blank>"
In the same area to the northwest there is an area that isn't covered by snow.  Towards the end of that area is a blackened patch.  79,39 is correct actually but I overlooked it.  The unqiuely named bear was at the end past some cats.
