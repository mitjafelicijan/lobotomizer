This quest can be found when you kill a Sithlid Harvester (silver elite) in the Field of Giants. The Harvester drops it's head as loot, which starts this quest.

It's kind of a short quest though. You just turn the head into Jorn and get 2400 XP (at yellow difficulty). | Subject: "dont waste your time"
This quest is a complete waste of time, unless you happen to get lucky and the rare spawn happens to be up then ok, but other then that, forget this quest and just do the other 3, i walked around the sithlid area for like 2 hours and never found him, the exp isnt worth the time.
