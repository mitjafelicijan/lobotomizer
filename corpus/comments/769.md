You can find Veren Tallstrider inside the tent of Thunder Bluff Armorers which is the large tent directly NorthWest of the high rise (look on map to see tent NW of high-rise). I came prepared with t he ingredients for the quest and was able to complete it right then and there.

Took me ages to find him. Hope this helps some else!
