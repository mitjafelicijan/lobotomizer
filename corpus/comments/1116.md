# These also drop off of the Green Scalebanes and the Scalebane Captins near the Pool of Tears. They are level 42-44. | Subject: "Getting the dust"
To reach the swamp as alliance (horde has a flight path in) get to Darkshire, then take the road out of town to the east. Keep looking to go east and you wil reach the swamp.

Once in the swamp, take the road down the hill. When the road turns east, immediately exit it on the south side. You will find an area with a small pool, around which are a number of flying dragon whelps. These were level 34-36, and dropped the dust with reasonable frequency. | Subject: "Area of dreamdust"
Go to bootybay, run to Grom'gol or take the windrider..

follow the path up north.. then you come in Duskwood..

follow to road to the east and you will end up in Deadwind Pass.. keep heading east, watch out for the birds they're nasty.. ;)

and you'll see where Swamp of Shadows is then. the first co-ords are the right one to go to. (1st post) | 14, 65 Swamp of Sorrows (Specks of Dream Dust drops from Dreaming Whelps) | Subject: "Location"
