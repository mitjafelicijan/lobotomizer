# This quest appears to be Tauren-only (or at least unavailable to Undead).

This quest is considered an optional preqrequisite to  Sergra Darkthorn and therefore you cannot see this quest if you have started that,  Plainstrider Menace, or any other part of that quest line. Abandoning Plainstrider Menace quest will make this one available.
