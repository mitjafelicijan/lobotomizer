# Subject: "Lakota'mani"
I think there's some confusion here.  The blue kodo is Owatanka on the east side of the road who gives a tail spike.  Lakota'mani is a large grey and pink kodo on the west side of the road (facing north) just north of CT. | Subject: "easy for lv 26"
Found this Kodo just north of Camp Taurajo, huge Kodo that really stands out next to the smaller red kodos that are normally there. Soloed this at Lv 26, killed him easily.

Once you kill him, you get the hoof. You don't talk to Jorn Skyseer to get the quest, just kill the mob and turn in the hoof to Skyseer. | Subject: "Confirmed, increases..."
Confirmed, increases spirit by 2 although the bonus spirit is removed when you die (just tested).
There are two other similar quests, starting from named mobs in the barrens, both of which grant 2 spirit:
