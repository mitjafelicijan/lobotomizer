# Subject: "Found it"
You have to find the pile of books on a table by the Gunthar Arcanus (lvl 53 but didn't attack me) and *open* it and loot the book. He is located on the island (Gunthars Retreat), in Brightwater Lake. Watch out for the Hungering Dead and Shambling Horrors. | Subject: "<Blank>"
67,43 Books on a stand | Coordinates are 67.42

Running this chain on its own is not necessary. It can be coordinated with other quests to minimize running time. A good companion quest chain is "At War with the Crusade" | Subject: "Start / End"
The person you turn it into is in the Mages Quarter in case anyone forgot, like me. The person isn't in the database for some reason. | Subject: "Location of Spellbook without coordinates"
There's a huge (Brightwater) lake to the northeast of Undercity (east of Brill). Go to the bigger island (the northern one) you'll see a small camp with fire, etc. There is also a table, on which you'll find the book.
