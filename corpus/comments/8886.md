# Location is huts around 24, 68. The murlocs also drop the cargo. | Subject: "Location"
The location of the Grimscale Murlocs is just to the west of Sunsail Anchorage. The cosmos coordinates are 25,72 | The cargo is along the Golden Strand, to the west of the quest NPC. The cargo is in barrels near the murloc huts, and also drops from the murlocs around there. Like Vasu said, make sure to kill the murlocs south of the river, not north. | Make sure you kill the ones west/ southwest, I made the mistake of going northwest and was killing murloc's for nothing
