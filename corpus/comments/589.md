# From the road at 38.47 you can go to the cave entrance at 41.50. The area outside is littered with Thrashtail Basilisk - these are not the ones you want. Inside the cave you'll find the quest mobs - Ironjaw Basilisks. The quest giver states that the crystals are rare, but I got 3 in 4 kills. Either I'm very lucky, or they've changed the drop rate significantly. | Subject: "<Blank>"
The actual cave entrance is at 41.50. I took the right passage and killed about 10 to 15 mobs for the 3 crystals - so the drop rate is more than Thottbot is showing. | Subject: "Easy!"
that may of been one of the easiet quests ever!
