60,55.Â  Don't even try going near the pretty white tower because the guards will hand you your ass.

Drop rate at or near 100%

-also they have some fire resistance so it's best to use arcane | Subject: "Location"
Location for the sisters is 58,58

Watch out for the NE guards, just got my butt handed to me by them | Subject: "Actually..."
...as I have observed they are not resistant to all schools. They are highly resistant to Fire, yes, but they are not resistant to Frost nor Arcane. They are also resistant to shadow (I tried with my shadow damage wand and a lot of the damage was resisted).

So go throw some Frostbolts or Arcane Missiles at them.
