Here is all things, you need for this Barbaric Iron questes (I hope, I have counted well):
Bronze Bar 150
Silver Bar 12
Iron Bar 104
Coarse Grinding Stone 12
Heavy Grinding Stone 4
Strong Flux 16
Medium Leather 16
Heavy Leather 4
Green Dye 10
Citrine 4 | Subject: "Almost not worth the trouble."
If you are 180 in Blacksmithing (which I got at level 32) the Green Iron Hauberk is easily twice as good as this Breastplate. Not nearly as easy to get but I guess in some instances you do get what you pay for (so to speak).

Edited, Tue May 31 23:08:12 2005 | If you're looking at the comments on this recipe, plan, or quest you might be a collector or completionist.
This is a compiled list of all of the cross-faction recipes in the game.

Most (not all)  Cooking recipes on the Alliance side are sold by Kendor Kabonka. The Horde do not have a corresponding NPC, so if you are an Alliance character wanting to create an alt on the opposite side to obtain the recipes for your main, unfortunately you'll have to have a level appropriate character to do the quests to obtain some of these recipes.

All of the recipes except one ( Plans: Orcish War Leggings) can be traded cross-faction on the neutral AH.
