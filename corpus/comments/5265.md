first off you have to do the quest to burn the archivists room in a 5man group in SC strat.

next, you have to kill Balnazzar to loot his head. this can be done in either a 5man group OR a 10man raid. take the head back to the LH chapel. (edit: the head can be looted by anyone that has the quest, not just one per raid.)

then he gives you a quest to kill baron rivendare. you have to 5man him to complete the quest. go back to LH chapel to complete that then tyrosus will prompt you to open the chest right next to him inside the chapel.

quest rewards are as noted by above poster, the choice of one of the three argent items. ones a shield, one is a one-hand sword, and i forget what the other is. | It's the box right behind him, in case you didn't realize ;) | Subject: "Argent Avenger"

At first you have to kill Balnazzar. He drops his head, which starts a quest, which tells you to go to duke nicholas the following quest tells you to kill Baron Rivendare and take his head to the duke. Then The duke gives you the quest where you have to go to the lord.
