This quest-chain is easy and it gives you something that is very expensive and/or annoying to get. REPUTATION with stormwind. I need 20k more reputation with stormwind to become exalted so I can buy a swift horse mount =). Instead of a ugly mechanostrider ^^

And besides u get cash. If the questrewards sucks , sell them.
