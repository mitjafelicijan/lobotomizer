Two-headed red ogre mage, looks exactly like all the other mages in the area. Patrols from barracks basement to town hall.

Soloable as a lvl 37 fire mage...after pulling him I nova'd, he then cast rain of fire over and over, which is easily dodgeable. Can always counterspell + frost nova + bandage if necessary.
