# Sven is in the most northwestern part of Darkshire. To get to him the quickest, fly to Sentinel Hill in Westfall and then go northeast across the river. It's faster than flying into Darkshire and setting out on foot to find him that way. | Subject: "Read this first!"
Whenever I need to get to Sven but I'm not in the area, I fly to Sentinal Hill in Westfall, and then just go north-east across the river, and then back.
Sure beats running all the way from DS to Sven, who is located so damn far.

Nice suggestion! that is a much faster way to getting to sven! and yes the confirmed location of sven is (7, 34) or the north western most part of darkshire

p.s.

i hated all the running from darkshire to raven hill! but i guess it was worth all the XP | Subject: "<Blank>"
sven is the guy in north western corner of duskwood
