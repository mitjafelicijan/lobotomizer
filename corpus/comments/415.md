# Subject: "Thottbot's quest data is incorrect."
This quest is in the retail release, I just completed it. The trick is that it's only available after you finish The Perfect Stout. The problem is that the quest giver for Rejold's New Brew is Tharek Blackstone, who's in Kharanos. The other problem is that right after you complete The Perfect Stout in Brewnall Village, you are asked to do Shimmer Stout.

Rejold's New Brew directly leads to Shimmer Stout, so if you accept Shimmer Stout upon completing The Perfect Stout (as presumably most people do) you won't be offered Rejold's New Brew.

So, if you really want to do Rejold's New Brew, you must do the following:

1. Complete The Perfect Stout in Brewnall Village.

2. Decline the offer to start Shimmering Stout (in Brewnall Village).

3. Head to Kharanos and talk to Tharek Blackstone. He's right outside of the blacksmithing building.

Tharek will offer you Rejold's New Brew, then you can head back to Brewnall Village whereupon Rejold's New Brew will lead automatically to Shimmering Stout.
