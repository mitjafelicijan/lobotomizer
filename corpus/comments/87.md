I gained a level, she looked at me
The quest was green
I said "Lady, what do you need?
I am the one
For the quest in the mine, underground."

She said "I am the one
For the quest, in the mine, underground."

She said to go find Billy Maclure
Up in the north
The tension heavy inside me now
I was the one
For the quest, in the mine, underground.

My peeps just whispered to me
"WTF R U!211!/1"
I said "I've got to track this young brat down !"
He responded quick and asked me
"wut quest u got to do?"
I said "Bernice has lost the jewel.."
I knew I had to kill Goldtooth, hey hey..

Billy Maclure has got some trouble
He's just a kid, a kid who had to confess
That he stole the lost necklace

I killed legions of all the swine
For a simple pie
Because it seems when it's almost done
The drops just don't come
For the quest, of the boar, on the ground.

So take my carving knife
Just remember to always look twice.

He told me he dropped the jewelry, down by Fargodeep
A gold-toothed kobold just picked it up and ran down the mine
For the quest, in the mine, underground

Going deeper always scared me
Ever since I was a newb
Don't go around, killing grey mobs' loot.
When I descended in that cavern
To the smell of Kobold puke
I knew what I had to do
To bring the head of Goldtooth back to her..

Billy Maclure has got some trouble
He's just a kid, a kid who has to confess
That he stole the lost necklace
Yes, he's got to confess
That he stole that lost necklace

Billy Maclure has got some trouble..
Billy Maclure has got some trouble..
Walk down, make a quick turn-in, just 3 more bubbles
Level to 60 and reduce this quest to rubble
Log out for an hour and my XP is doubled..
