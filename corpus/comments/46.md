# Subject: "Possible Pre-Req"
I *think* the pre-req for this quest is Deliver Thomas' Report. | The murlocs are located upstream the river and to the northeast. They are easily spotted by their island-style huts, and the fins don't take too long to drop but the murlocs are very difficult to face alone at level 10. Tough quest imho. | Though not noted in the quest hierarchy/dependencies, this quest is not available from Guard Thomas until you have delivered his report to Marshal Dughan.
