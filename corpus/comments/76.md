# Subject: "these are the real cordinates"
(61,54)... i was looking for awhile till i found out that the guy that posted the other coordinates was wrong | Subject: "the correct one"
the correct coordinate is 62.53 | Subject: "Level"
I did it at level 8 and it was pretty tough so i think it should be done at level 9 or 10. | Subject: "Location completes quest"
I'm a lvl 11 Dwarf Rogue. First I went South at Goldshire for some ungodly reason. I than went East. I kept goin till I found the tower of Azora or whatever it is. Once I discovered that, the mine was visible on my map. North West of Tower, I headed there, stealthed in and completed quest at coord 60.50. I than just stealthed out. Only took a minuete. Hope this helps.
