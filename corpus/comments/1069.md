# This quest starts in the Barrens but has you going to Stonetalon Mountain, not a bad deal as there are a number of quests in Stonetalon Mountains around this level.

The spider eggs can be found in a number of locations. Sishir Canyon has the highest concentration of spiders and offers the quick route to collecting the eggs. Besseleth is also located in Sishir Canyon, a level 21 elite spider with a quest to kill her.

But the spider eggs can also be found in the forests of Windshear Crag and Mirkfallon Lake. | Stonetalon Mountains: 63,57

Run arround that area you will find the egg under the trees
