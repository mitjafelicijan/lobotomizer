If you enter Stonewatch Keep from the south after crossing the bridge, look behind the large broken door on the right. He should be in the far corner of the courtyard along with a few other elite blackrock orcs. | Subject: "<Blank>"

Head south across bridge then left at road; dodge the spawn, alternately, swim ESE but there are 25e threshers there, once u get to keep, fight past bridge guards, go behind broken doors, and find two more guards, then a group of three directly across from them and finally the man with three buddies. Each of these mobs can be done without aggroing the other two, but the dying will run for help from these other mobs.

Take a hunter if possible to use human tracking, or a druid in panther mode prowling, much easier to find Tharil.

Just remember he is outside the keep but inside the walls at the SE corner.

Tharil'zun is located in the southwestern section of stonewatch keep and he is surrounded by quite a few elite buddies.
