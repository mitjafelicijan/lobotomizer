# Subject: "Alternative quest pick up spot"
This quest can also be picked up from the Lion Statue near the Tower of Ilgalar in RedridgeÂ  - the same one you used in 'A Watchful Eye'.

Lot quicked to walk from the tower in 'Looking Further' rather then having to go all the way back to Elwynn Forest to speak to Theocritus. | Subject: "A fun fight"
Five of us lvl25-32 (3 mages, 1 priest, 1 druid) went up and wiped the top floor of the tower in one fight. Much fun. ^_^ Like a mage should, Morganth stays out of the melee, so I (32 mage) had to go after him one on one. Without his buddies to protect him, he went down easily. | Subject: "<Blank>"
This quest is actually part of a series. You must do the "A Watchful Eye" and then the "Looking Further" quests first to get this one (by going back and talking with Theocritus afterwards). | First of all, you don't have to get the Glowing Pendant to start the questline. You can start it at the Tower of Azora before hand.

Secondly, he also summons a level 30 Abomination (Undead). The summon has a cast time I noticed but I am not sure if it's interruptable or not. When I did it most recently, it was him, a succubus, and 2 Shadow Caster Gnolls.

We 2 manned him... Druid and Shaman. I (druid) tanked while the shaman healed, dropped totems, and auto-attacked my target.
