# Subject: "Spawns Stitches"
Completing this quest will Spawn Stitches near Raven Hill Cemetary. The Night Watch will blame <name> (you) for it too, lol! By the time I'd run up the road to get him a Tauren had already finished him off. >_> | Starts this quest, which finishes the line:

Also spawns this NPC, who will then run along the path towards town. Not necesary to kill him, which is good, because he's pretty burly.
