Here's the scoop, guys.  Approach the statue from the south, following the trail that leads from Render's Valley to the Tower.  If you follow the edge of the mountains when approaching the statue you should have no problems.  Do NOT approach the tower by following the road east from Alther's Mill.  That direction is thick with mobs lvl 24-26.

North from Renders Valley: Extrememly easy
East from Alther's Mill:  Painfully annoying | Subject: "Lion statue location"
Its at 84,46 | The statue is on 84, 46 for those who can't find it...If you don't have Cords..its up the path from Lakeshire then follow the fork to the right. Head east till you see the tower on the right (past the castle) the statue is on the left facing the tower. Just right click on the statue. Remember to accept the follow on quest.
