Obtain the red glow at ANY of the various geysers in Silithus, DO NOT take it back to Cenarion Hold, or Bronzebeard encampment as the maps are showing on this quest.

The correct turn in point of the transporter is on the Big Red icon when u push M (map).  Unfortunatly i spent ~20 minutes or more running around Silithus.

Note:  DO NOT MOUNT ... u lose the red glow.
You are able to cast all other spells...not sure if u lose red glow by hearthing or getting summoned.
