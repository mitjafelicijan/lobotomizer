Here's how I did it using a bit of guile:

Run by the Sentinel's at the gate, with or without S tealth.  Use Vanish, poof, no more Sentinels.  Avoid the ones inside like the plague, and head straight to the town hall, which thankfully is devoid of them. There are Paladins there though, so obfuscate past them with stealth and pick their pockets too because they are oblivious, mwahaha.  Go inside the town hall and apply Crippling Poison to your weapons.  Sap one Pally, then get the other one to aggro you.  Run to the other end of the hall and stab him till the Crippling effect works.  Sprint to the Libram and voila, the slow ass bastard will never make it in time!  Escape by whatever means you find appropriate.  Easy easy! | Subject: "just to let u know"
These items are in WESTERN PLAGUELANDS, not eastern.  The quest is in eastern, so it's easy to assume they're in eastern. | The libram is in the house looking like the Southshore Inn, first floor, inner room, on a table. It glows.

You can avoid fighting into hearthglen, if you have done the quest "Scarlet Subterfuge" before. Just talk to "Myranda the Hag", get the Scarlet Illusion buff and walk into Harthglen to get the book.

When you loot the book, the Scarlet Illusion will get removed. Since I play priest, I just caster Power Word: Shield, Fear, and run off after looting the book. | If you are lucky in the same room with Davil's Libram you will find Scarlet Judge... a rare spawn :) | Leads to the Maurauders of Darrowshire:
