# In order to get the 'Baying of Gnolls' quest, which leads to 'Howling in the Hills', and 'Underbelly Whelp Scales' quest, you need to do 'The Price of Shoes' quest and 'Return to Verner'. | Subject: "cords"
found a camp of brutes and mystics at 21,35 | Subject: "Goldshire"
There is a quest you get that asks you to run an errand to goldshire this is a pre requisite for this quest. | Subject: "Adjoined quest"
Do the Everstill bridge quest at the same time. You get it from Foreman Oslow right there in town. it is totally worth it cause you do both at the same time and are getting credit for both. its really handy for xp and time savers | Subject: "Gnolls!! mystics and brutes!!"
if ur looking for those gnolls then go look in the valley just beyond Lakeshire its full of em! the valley entrance and exit is from 38,31 to 23,36 XD
