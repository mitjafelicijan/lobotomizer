Elaborating on Glais' recommendations:

This is really in the Frayfeather Highlands. (makes sense since these are all Hippogryph-looking flying mobs)

What you might want to do is use the following location macro (modified from wowwiki.com):
/script px,py=GetPlayerMapPosition("player")
/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(format("[ %s ] %s , %s",GetZoneText(),(px*100),py*100)));

I use the "X marks the spot" icon (in the middle of row 23 of the icons)
I labeled this macro "Location"

Start just North of the small lake in the furthest SW corner of the map and move wouth then east along the hills.
Some nest locations to get you started:
55.9, 76
56.7, 76.6
56.3, 77.4
53, 71.5

At Level 49:
1050 xp when receiving the Egg Crate from the Egg-o-Matic each time.
1050 xp when receiving the Box of Rations after handing in the Egg Crate from an Ordinary Egg.
2100 xp when receiving the Box of Spells (Agility II and Stamina III) after handing in the Egg Crate from Fine Egg.

No reputation gain, but the quests are repeatable.(blue question mark).

I'd go with hearthstoning in Gadgetzan, but it's a toss up whether you ride from Thalanar or take another hippogryph and come south from Feathermoon.
