On the lower decks, there's a sick goblin sheltering under an up-turned half boat.

McKinley is in the building just next to that. | Hes on the top floor, if you see the 'anchor' hanging off the dock and turn around your looking at his house. Also the big shark is hanging above you.

The exact corrds in the doorway are 27.6,77.1

This is a good quest to go with https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=571 | These Gorillas can be found in huge spawns in Mistvale Vally, (34,64) took me about 5 mins as a 40 shaman!
