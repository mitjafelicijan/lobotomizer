camp kosh

The best way to go in and get the crate is to hug the north wall. As you enter the camp, it's pretty readily visible in the open. I had to kill about six ogres to get it. They aren't particularly tough if you can get them singly, and watch out for the Mystics, who are shamans.

I got 2150 XP for this quest at level 38, when it was yellow.

The main path is the way most of us come into the badlands - from thelsamar, past Uldaman.

If you go east from the quest giver and then north thru the Dustwind Gulch - you will find Camp Kosh.

Some of the ogres are only lvl 35 too. | https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=2867
