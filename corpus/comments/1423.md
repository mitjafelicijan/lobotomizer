Alright guys, I will share some information so you could find them quicker.  I hope you can do the same when you know more.

This is four spawn-locations I know of;
1. 29,51
2. 33,47
3. 29,38
4. 43,34

I delivered 4 crates in 15 minutes, and 5 crates after 1.5 hours. This means I didn't find another spawn-location and someone picked it before I did so I find the fourth at one of my known locations.

*Edit:
Found another location:
5. 37,37 | Subject: "SW HONOUR POINT QUEST ONLY."
SW HONOUR POINT QUEST ONLY.
The Lost Supply quest has that single purpose to give you honour points with SW and nothing more. Before you reach lvl 46 you do get 25 rep points per crate! You can start The Lost Supply quest at lvl 30. It does only give you a small amount of xp the first time you hand it in.

And the day came when I, a gnome mage (lvl 43), finally got my horse.

I started this character whit the purpose to get exhalted with SW to get a horse. To make it a little easier to myself I headed to Elwyn Forest when I reached lvl 5. From that moment did I only do SW related quests.

I tried to start the crate collection at lvl 30. However it was too difficult at this low lvl with all the critters being lvl 35-40. So I went out and levelled up to 35 and went back. Again I had to give up � the beatings were to much all the time. I simply agroed everything in sight!
Once again I had to leave SoS disappointed. I went out and took all available quests and got myself to lvl 40. I even bought my mechanostrider which I really do recommend all who has the 100G needed - the regular run speed simply is to slow!

Now everything was a lot easier. I printed out a map of SoS and marked the crate spawn place every time I found one. However after a while I did not need the map anymore. I quickly found a path around in SoS from one spawn place to the next. And by using this same path over and over again I could quickly scout through the whole area. You do also learn all the critters position very fast.
Note: it is possible to cross the water several places without getting dis-mounted.

Here are all the details you will need:

Honour points from neutral to exhalted:
Neutral: 0/3.000
Friendly: 0/6.000
Honoured: 0/12.000
Revered: 0/21.000
Total: 42.000 after this you get 0/1000 but those are not needed to get the horse!)

All the crates are to be handed in to Quartermaster Lungertz.
He is situated in Nethergarde Keep in Blasted Lands (coordinates 66,21).

2s 54c in the reward, no exp given. 5 reputation at level 49. | This quest is repeatable and is great for grinding rep with Stormwind. Starting at revered it should take you 1000 trips to hit exalted unless you are human and then it will take around 909 trips. | Subject: "Lost Crate"
