# The banners are dropped by the Dragonmaw Orcs at Angerfang Encampment, due east of Whelgar's Excavation Site. The entrance to the camp is around 42, 41. Be cautious while fighting there, because, although the mobs are reasonably spaced out, the Raiders have a tendency to net you and then run for help when they get low on health. Overall, not a bad quest. Good drop rate, nothing too tough to solo. | Subject: "<Blank>"
Orc Camp tloc 43,43 | Subject: "Orcs are a PITA"
These dragonmaw orcs are a PITA to kill. They are levels 26-27, they spawn like rabbits in heat, there are a lot of roamers, they root you with their "Net" spell, they dual wield like dervishes (i.e., fast), they run early (like at 20% life) and they run FAST. Worst of all is the drop rate on the banners - I killed 45-plus orcs to get the 8 banners.

My experience is from doing the quest as a 27 druid, your experience may be different; I saw a 25 hunter and a 32 paladin doing pretty well here. A druid can break their roots by shapechanging, but that takes mana, and they will root you 2-3 times a fight in the worst case. Its good to have a ranged attack like spells, a bow, a gun or a pet to kill them fast when they run.
