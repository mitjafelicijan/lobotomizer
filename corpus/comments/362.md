Head north tword the mills until you see the Rattlecage Soldiers right after the bend in the road. He is right on top of the left side of the road. He is the only one with a glowing neck | I got this quest today by killing Captain Dargol in the crypt located at 52.27 in Tirisfall! :) hope this helps!
