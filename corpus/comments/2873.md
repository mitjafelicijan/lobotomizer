Pirate Hats Ahoy! (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8365) | The shipment is in the house to the right of the camp on the second floor but watch out as there is like 4-5 pirates just down the stairs that lead to the second floor and they can't be pulled one by one. | Subject: "<Blank>"
72,46 2nd floor | Subject: "Great Advice Made a Great Quest"
Many thanks to all the posters. I probably would not have had the patience to look for this one-horse burg except for the directions. My 41 Druid stealthed in but they spotted me and attacked. Shifted to the bear and made it up to the second floor where the poor bear died a quiet death. Never had a chance.

Following your instructions, I was not upset at all or worried about corpse campers. Rezzed on the second floor, picked up the shipment of rum (it was surprisingly light...), shifted to bear form and charged down the stairs through hundreds (well, maybe 5) bad guys, all throwing stun as fast as they could.

But I made it out, raced for the water, rinsed off all the blood and whacked three of the big turtles on the way back to the bar. All in all, not a bad quest, mostly thanks to all of you. | Subject: "LVL 52 warrior"
walked in - killed everything - walked out - had lunch | Subject: "Stoley's Shipment Location"
Upon entering the walled-in camp, turn right and enter that building. Top floor, examine the boxes. | Fun little trick to complete this way under-level: run into the pirate camp and make a beeline for the two-story house to the right. If you can get close enough, and get killed, take your ghost upstairs to the bedroom and you can usually resurrect inside, loot the cargo and hearth (or, since I was on my shaman, Astral Recall) to safety. | Subject: "Stoley's Shipment"
The walled pirate town in question is not very far south. The trick is to find the entrance to the secluded beach area, you have to go through a short tunnel through the mountain.

aonce in this area, there are guys to kill, but if you don't want to waste your time, make your way carefully over to the fenced in encampment. It is onthe second floor of the building on your right when you enter, it seems to be the only 2 floor building. There are 3 to kill on 1st floor and 3 more in an adjacent room that is half a floor up. The quest item is upstairs. | Subject: "Suicide Run"
The shipment is on the top floor of the first house on the right as you enter the compound area.

I soloed this as a 45 warlock with my voidwalker.
First I pulled the two pirates on the first floor of the house outside and killed them.

Then made my way inside to the 2nd floor where I got jumped by 3 pirates. Sic pet on one , feared another and took on the 3rd. Ended up dying on the 2nd floor.. rezed with soulstone and RAN up to the top floor.

Shipment is the pile of boxes. Got jumped by 4 pirates used Howl of Terror which sent them running with just enough time to open & collect the shipment before they came back.

Used Howl of Terror again to send them running and hightailed it out of there with about 100 hp left but I survived! having only died once.

Hope that helps :) | Subject: "Easy to Solo"
It's at 72,46, as you enter the camp the house in your right hand.

I soloed it with my 45 warlock and the help og my voidwalker.

Warlocks: Just make good use of fear.

Easy.
