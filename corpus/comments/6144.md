# When you get to Nathanos, this quest won't be available. You will need to do the following:

1. To Kill With Purpose
2. Un-Life's Little Annoyances
3. The Ranger Lord's Behest (you may need a group of 2/3 people for this one).

Then, you hand those in and he will offer you the following quests:

4. Duskwing, Oh How I Hate Thee...
5. The Corpulent One

You definitely need a group for the elites, especially Borelgore. He hits like a freight train and has a huge amount of HP.
