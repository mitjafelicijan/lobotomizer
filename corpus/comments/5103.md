You will see a mob with two dogs, etc...there is a door to the left...go through the doors; turn with the hallway...when you come out into the next room...turn  directly right and jump down on the ledge...run along the ledge and jump down one more level to the ground...there you will see mobs under camps...behind the first camp to the right you will notice an opening to a ramp which heads downward...fight the mob or use invisibility potion and then go down that ramp. At the bottom you will see the body where you can obtain this quest. You must be an armorsmith. After you get the quest...loot the same area again and you will get the Unfired Plate Gauntlets. You will need both the quest and the Unfired Plate Gauntlets item.

1. Return to Winterspring and to turn in the quest to Malyfous Darkhammer in Everlook. He will give you a follow-up quest to get him some mats.
