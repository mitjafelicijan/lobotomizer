Definitely easier to complete this quest in the South Eastern part of Redridge Mountains.

Approx Loc: 71,78 | You don't have to kill the elite ones in stonewatch keep to get these. You can get them from the non-elite level 20's or so up the path from lakeshire. | Subject: "<Blank>"
Easiest place I found for this quest was in the South East.Â  The orcs there are level 18-20 and there were no elites either.
