Stood next to him at 19,78.  From Southshore just go NW past some farms and you'll see the ruins and dome.  look for the dot on your minimap! | This quest series continues with Ansirem's Key (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=603). | Subject: "The REAL DEAL...."
I found Dalaran by travelling NORTH from Southshore, and turning LEFT (west) on the road... then following by an immediate RIGHT, meaning of course, to the NORTH... travel NORTH through the HILLSBREAD FIELDS even if you can't find a road through (I didn't bother looking) and weave through all the spiders and bears.

Behold a large, purple... glowing... thing.  And a yellow blip on your map!

I hope I was helpful.
