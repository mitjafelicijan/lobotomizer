Found a nice camp of Gnoll levels 11 and 12 at 43,14 a little north of Jangolode Mine.

They seemed to drop the Paws about 25% of the time!

Good luck! :D | Subject: "<blank>"
it's at 57,14 above The Jensen Stead | Subject: "Patience"
this quest is not too hard to complete IF YOU TAKE YOUR TIME! the gnolls are at the south end of the zone (right by the bridge to Duskwood) If you wait about 1 minute you'll see that one of the gnolls will leave the rest of the pack. Wait for this and attack the one gnoll, making sure not to link the others. Pull the one away from the pack and kill them one at a time. You'll probably go through about 20 gnolls to get the 8 gnoll paws. | I did not have any luck killing Gnolls scattered around in Westfall. I found all my Gnoll Paws at a Gnoll camp by the Alexston Farmstead, near the coast, at 30,50. | Subject: "Location for lower level Gnolls"
In Westfall: 52,17 near Furlbrow's Pumpkin Farm and also on the ridge at 56,15. Mobs are levels 11-13. Just be careful because they BAF (Bring a Friend - come in groups, etc)
