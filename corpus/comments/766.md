The Swoop Gizzard dropped before I even realized I had the quest.  I think around 42,40.

The Prarie Wolf Heart also dropped rather fast.  I believe it was around the same location as the Swoop Gizzard. 

I had to a ton of Flatland Cougers to get the Flatland Couger Femur.  I believe that one finally dropped off the ones at about 52,32, somewhere in the Golden Plains. 

I gave up trying to find normal Plainstriders.  The Plainstrider Scale dropped off an Adult Plainstrider at exactly 36,38.
