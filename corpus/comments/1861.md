# Found in the Elwynn forest 28.6, 61.4 | You can't do both lvl10 mage quests. You have to choose either this one or the Gnome one. Your race doesn't matter. If you already took one and changed your mind, you can abandon it and take the other, but once you finish it and get your reward, you can't do the other one. | Subject: "hehe"
just go to mirror lake, step into the water and right-klick on the bottle ^^ btw, if you right click   
on the bottle anywhere else it says "requires mirror lake" | Subject: "Which lake?"
I think half the problem is that there are two mirror lakes. Try the one to the west. | Subject: "Read it :)"
