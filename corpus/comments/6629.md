Grundig Darkcloud doesn't have anything to do with Kaya and the quest she gives. He spawns at the entrance to the house independant of Kaya.

Coords confirmed. | Darkcloud can be found at Grimtotem Post

A quick pointer, to make this easier.
Walk down the path away from the quest giver, walk past the first tents on your right. Walk through Camp Aparaje and up the hill, then turn right into the Tauren camp there. Follow the path round to the right for 60 / 70 yds, killing all the mobs one by one. You should kill your 6 brutes that way. Grundig is standing in the first tent on your left. Easily pulled on his own. Enter the tent to collect the escort quest, whilst you are there. The Tauren you escort will travel back the way you came, so it should be clear of mobs. Beware that you are jumped byÂ  three tauren when you walk through Camp Aparaje.
Take care with the casters with staves as they heal themselves.
Good Luck | Subject: "lvls"
he is lvl 18, gaurded by a couple 17 sorcerers and 16 mercenaries. Not too bad as they are spread out a good deal. you will find Kaya in his hut.
