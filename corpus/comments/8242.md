# Assuming you're going from 0 neutral to 0 friendly, you'll need 3000 rep points, which means you'll need to turn in this quest 120 times. That's 240 scales, 120 coal, and 1200 heavy leather. | Subject: "Farming!"
I've found that the heavy leather is very farmable off the Mountain Yetis and Giant Yetis in the Alterac Mountains. Bonuses:

1. They drop money instead of trash items that you have to constantly chuck away.
2. Heavy Leather drop rate is high.
3. Thick concentration.
4. Fast enough respawn.
5. People usually aren't going to bug you.
6. Drops medium leather if it does drop high (about 25% or 33% of the time), so you can combine it up.
7. They are lower level than the Badlands mobs that are good for farming heavy leather from.
