I completed this at level 49 and got 4200 XP. I also got increases in my reputations with Darnassus and Wildhammer Clan. | Subject: "Silvermane stalker"
Silvermane stalker is the highest level of silvermane encountered in hinterlands. The ones I fought are all lv48. And they can stealth, which is just pain in the butt. If you start out of AP, the alliance town, you'll travel east. Along the way you'll encounter 2 types of silvermane, mangy silvermane (lv40-41) and silvermane something (lv43-44). You will have to continue to the east. The best way to spot a silvermane stalker is simply to walk in the woods, hope to walk in front of one and spot him before he sees you. | Subject: "Corrected Instructions: All you need to know"
