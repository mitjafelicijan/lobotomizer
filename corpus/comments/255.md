# Subject: "Here are teh cords"
I didnt read too deeply. but I didnt see any exact cords so here they are.

( 62 , 22 )Â  From there go east

you will find all but the brutes outside.

Sadly the brutes are in the caves.

I would say you need at least 2 ppl here and even then you can still get cought off guard...HAVE FUN | Subject: "These guys are tough"
I was just out exploring Loch Modan because I'd never had the chance to when I found the Mo'grosh Stronghold. So okay, let's have fun. Everything else in the area was 1 or 2 shot with my 38 mage, so a piece of cake right? Not exactly. The elite ogres went down like the mid 30's turtles I'd been grinding in Dushwallow Marsh, about 4 hits of 400dmg to kill each one, so their hp is in the 1500's range. If you take this at lvl 19 like this says, you'd better be able to last forever in a fight, bring a big party, or some high lvl's with you. There were two low 20's hunters out there doing this so I partied up with them, one of them shared this quest with me and things went very easy. I had a lot of fun nuking the elites, but didn't get much else out of it, just 20S. :P
