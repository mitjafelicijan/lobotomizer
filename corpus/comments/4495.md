For those without tloc, he's in the valley just west of the spider cave entrance. | Subject: "Co-ords"
I found him at 53,33.

Despite what the quest giver says, looking around the cave didn't help.

Me and a friend went around the whole cave system about ten times before we gave up, ran outside then saw him on the minimap. He was nestled in a little valley to the west of the cave, for those of you who don't have Cosmos. | Iverron's most common coordinates are 55, 33. He can be found in a small valley west of the spider cave where he is sitting down. | Subject: "X"
54.32 :D
