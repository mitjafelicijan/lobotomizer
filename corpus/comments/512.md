Syndicate Spy and Syndicate Wizard drop the rings at Strahnbrad "ghost town" in the nort of Alterac Mountains, about 62,43. The droprate is about 50%. Mob lvl 34-36. | Subject: "actually"
You get them from the syndicate wizards, and the first /tloc was closet... i found it around 61,48! Good luck! btw, its just past the ogres to the right! | You can get this without going into the keep itself.
There is a place at the north of Dalaran called " Danreds Fold " and you get there by following the shores north from Dalaran.
The drop rate for me was average, i killed around 15-25 syndicates for the 7 rings, but i got some decent exp.
They are level 38-40.

For those with coordinates, it's at 38,18 in alterac.
