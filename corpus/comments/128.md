# Subject: "Actual Location"
The actual location is at 33,6. There are only a few champions on the outside camp, but in the cave there are more. | The Warlock style mobs in this area are the biggest pain...they are all grouped up in packs of 2-3...Expect to kill at least that many with each pull...another note is that they run...and will bring other party's to kill you just that much faster...grab a friend or 3 and hit this hard...look inside the cave for the escort quest...that should make this worth wild...(hes in the cave follow the left most path round the little pond inside and in the back cave there...)
