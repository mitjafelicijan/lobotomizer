# Quest Title: Rattling the Rattlecages
# Quest URL: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3901
# Just a tip for Classic players, the Rattlecages share respawns with the other 2 mobs seen around. Be sure to keep killing everything. After doing this during the US Stress test yesterday, this was probably the longest quest to complete. Lots of competition, and shared spawn makes it time consuming. But stick it out. Enjoy Classic. No rush!
