Hi! and thanks for making this forum.. It has been a great help for me, and now I'll make sure, I can help others, which is in my situation..

Back to topic: The quest is quite easy. You get the quest from Brave Moonhorn south of the Southern Barrens (the north part of Thousand Needles), and then all you have to do is to take the lift down and follow the way. It'll lead you to a "crossroad" where Freewind Post is marked!
