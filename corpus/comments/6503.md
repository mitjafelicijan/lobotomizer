# Good concentration of them around (70, 76). They mostly stay close to trees. Just listen for the "stealth" sound and keep hitting tab to select them as soon as they are in range. | Subject: "Coordenades"
The Ashenvale Outrunners are stealth in the coor 68,76 & 69,76 | Subject: "Area"
They are simply stealthing around x=68-76 y=68-74.
For those of you without cosmos that is basicly the area between the road south of Splintertree Post and The Dor' Danil Barrow Den-a little on eithier side and also, surprisngly, I found Sharptalon hanging around.
And the NPC is out in front of the tower at the beginning of the small path into Splintertree. I hope this is clear enough to anyone working on this quest.Please lt me know if it isn't. | Subject: "info"
This quest is rather easy. Just stay south of Splintertree Outpost and slay all that you see. Every few minutes or so you'll run into a stealthy Night Elf. Tag 'em and bag 'em.

My results:
You gain 1950 experience.
Your reputation with Darkspear Trolls has increased. | Subject: "<Blank>"
I always find mine directly south of Splintertree.

Just run in circles around the bases of the trees, the are always under the trees. | Subject: "NPC Loc"
