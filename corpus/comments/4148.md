# Subject: "Humor?"
Humor? Very odd concept - I'm just here to kill things... (nothing to laugh about). In any case, once completed, this quest just gives 5000 XP and a quest zapper that only seems useful for killing these midget plants. Anyone found any other uses? | Subject: "this whole area reeks of nintendo allusions.."
I think the bloodpetal zapper is just be another allusion towards Nintendo's stuff--The Zapper. There are several Legend of Zelda references there and this quest line is all about Mario and Luigi if you're somehow still unaware.
