Guys coordinates are fine for people who have the mod but don't put down people who prefer not to use it.  It's their choice.  Someone merely said it'd be nice if real directions were given and you jumped down their throats.  Sure the mod is nice but you can't force people to use it anymore than people can force you to give simple text directions.

If you'd rather not take time to help people regardless of whether or not they're using YOUR favorite mod, then kindly don't say anything instead of turning this discussion into a flamewar.

One thing that text directions will do is navigate you around hazzards such as enemy towns, mountains, cliffs, etc. that a simple beeline to the coordinate will not necessarily do.

I don't have a coordinate mod yet, but when I get one I sure won't begrudge people who don't have one and asked NICELY for simple directions, which I will provide once I complete this quest. | Subject: "Loc"
