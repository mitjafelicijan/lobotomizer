# Subject: "This Quest"
This quest is only obtainable once you've done the quest "Timbermaw Ally", also given by Grazle. Along with this quest upon completion of "Timbermaw Ally", he also gives you a quest called "Speak to Nafien".

"Feathers for Grazle" is a repeatable quest, although Grazle does not appear to have the blue Question Mark above his head. | These mobs are heavily farmed, I suggest finding off peak times to grind them. Also just killing the mobs gives you rep, so like all turn in quests for rep, hold on to the turn ins until kills don't give rep anymore.

This way you minimize the amount of time spent grinding rep overall.
