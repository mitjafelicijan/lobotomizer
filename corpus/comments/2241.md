# The entrance to the tree is at the coordinates 32, 16. As you cross the bridge from the center of Darnassus, move to the Cenarion Enclave and take a left at the riding instructor selling Sabers. Go to the smaller tree with a split in the middle and Syurna should just be below. If you delete the rose, you need to go back and start the quest over again. | Subject: "Ok."
Go to the Cenarion Enclave district in Darnassus and when you get there you'll see the girl dot waypoint on your map. it's misleading. If you search hard enough there's a door that leads underground that's directly underneath the gold dot above ground.

other than that it's pretty easy. cheers.
