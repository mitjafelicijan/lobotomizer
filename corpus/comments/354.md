Nissa's Remains

If you walk up the path leading to Agamand Mills Nissa's remains will be inside the first house you see.
To get her remains you will need to kill Nissa Agamand (lvl 10).

Cord's: (49,35)

Gregor's Remains

From Nissa's Remains walk north west to a wind mill and kill Gregor Agamand (lvl 10).

Cord's: (47,30)

After i killed him at the above cord's I noticed him walking around at (43,30) so if no luck at first set of cord's try this one. :)

Thurman's Remains

Walk South West to another wind mill located next to a clif face and kill Thurman Agamand (lvl 10)

Cord's: (42,33)

Note All of these targets seem to walk around there above area's.
Also there are normaly Darkeye Bonecaster's with them.

Very quick respawn time too.

I hope this helps and enjoy :) | Nissa's Remains

See you in WoW | Subject: "Info Update"
I finished the quest earlier as a Level 9 Undead Priest, I received the quest as Level 8, the only trouble I had being lower level than suggested, was the adds from other little monsters *rottens and bonecasters*, all in all at level 9 this quest had a great reward in terms of EXP but was a bit difficult to accomplish alone.

Also I only received 875 EXP at Level 9.

A little more about Gregor's location. As previous poster mentioned, you take the left fork out of square where grain silos, barn and cottage is at. As the road curves to the left, Gregor is at the second windmill tower on the right. The one with the big tree stump next to it. I saw him spawn on the opposite side of the windmill from the road. So you'll have to go up to windmill and go around to other side and check for him. There should be a lootable water barrel there too.
