Access the mountain from the rope-bridge on the NW side, wind up to the cave near the top.  You'll see a stone grave in front of the cave, go past that to  near the S edge of the cliff, there is a small dirt pile there.  Plant the head, watch and laugh. | Subject: "<Blank>"

The gloves sell for 86s69c and the ring sells for 65s42c, neither of which are great. Both will disenchant into dream dust, but the gloves also have a chance to yield lesser eternal essence. | Subject: "Experience/Reputation"
At level 55, this got me 5250 XP and an increase in my reputation with Ironforge.
