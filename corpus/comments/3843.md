OK here are the exact steps to get the Sprite Darter since many people seem to be confused on how to actually get it. Just remember you need to be level 38 to qualify for this quest.

1. Go to find Kindal Moonweaver, who gives you a quest called Freedom for all Creatures. She is not easy to locate. Her coordinates are 65,46, and to reach her, you need to walk up a ramp up against a cliff hidden behind a tree behind the Tauren village. Follow the ramp up, and you will see her and another NPC called Jer�Kai Moonweaver overlooking the Tauren village.

2. After the Freedom for all Creatures quest, talk to Jer�Kai. She gives you a quest called Doing Justice. After that quest, she sends you to Darnassaus.

3. After getting your reward at Darnassaus, go back to the Tauren village and talk to Jer�Kai again. She gives you a quest to bring an egg to Quentin at Thousand Needles.

4. Keep doing the link of quests after, and you will eventually get the Sprite Darter pet! | Originally posted by Sakura

Note: I was not the person to type this up. I merely recommend the site. | Subject: "Coordinates"
Agnar Beastamer is inside the Wildhammer Keep, downstairs. (14,43) And Quentin is in Thousand Needles at (78,74) | Subject: "Experience/Reputation"
At level 49 I got 4200 XP for this. My reputation with Darnassus also increased, as did my reputation with Wildhammer Clan.

In case you fail as I did due to disconnection....  The time will run out while you are offline.
Simply abandon the quest and go back to the shimmering flats.  The quest will be available again to you and the timer starts over. 
You do not need more potions.
You do not lose your egg when you abandon the quest

Also, the fastest way to get there is:
1. Ride Back to Gadget
2. Fly to Theramore
3. Take the boat to Menethil,
4. Fly to Aerie Peak

The Dwarf you need to speak to is in the lowest part of the Aerie peak keep.  Go through the door where the mailbox is.  that is the correct building.

Enjoy your little dragon! | Subject: "Accoring to someone I asked..."
You need to complete the "Freedom for all creatures" series first, then return to those NPCs.  The downside is that the last part of this series takes you to Darnassus to see Tyrande and she doesn't really indicate that you can now go back there and get a new set of quests :(
