Well I found the Gelkis spokesperson relatively easily, but Warug, the Magram spokesperson was a bit harder.

If you look at Magram Village, there is a small island with tents on it. Looking at the map, draw a straight line north from the island. Warug is North of the island and EAST of the imaginary line you drew. You should see the indicator on your minimap when you get close enough (he's hangin out by a big fire)

Hope this helps | Subject: "Warug"
Warug at hill with bonfire, NE of village.
