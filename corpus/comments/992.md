# Quest Title: Gadgetzan Water Survey
# Quest URL: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=992
# The area is around 39, 30. To the south of Zul'Farrak. | I had two level 47 bugs, but I just bubbled and ran away. Killing them is not needed in the quest. And they spawned after I took the water. | The waterpool can be found at 39,29. For those not using coordinates, just head straight west from Gadgetzan, it's just below the entrance to Zul'Farrak.

There are some elites around the waterpool, but those can easily be evaded. After you've taken the water sample, 2x NPCs will spawn (Either lvl 48 or 47). | Subject: "Experience/Reputation"
I got 3050 XP from this, plus my reputation with Gadgetzan "increased". I did this at level 47. | Subject: "<Blank>"
Vanish with Rogue worked great!
confirm cord: 39,30
2x lvl 47 Centipaar Tunneler spawned in the middle of the pool. | I had a 48 bug and 47 bug come out but they didnt touch me.

What I did was as soon as I clicked the widget, I spammed my mount button, so I was mounted by the time the bugs came and got away safely. | If you are a rogue/other stealthing class, you can quickly hit stealth right after you fill the widget and sneak away unharmed.
