The best advice I can give you is.... Stand at 57,56 and wait til he comes.

For all you who are not getting the drop, it is because you must have started the quest chain first.  Starts with Jorn Skyseer at Camp T in the barrens- called the Ashenvale Hunt. | This is one of three quests involved with killing a named beast in Ashenvale.
