36, 91 by a little shack western part of darrowshire nestled between two hills. | Quick hint if you use the addon 'Questie':
You can only complete one of the two quests which ask you to find Pamela Redpath.
Either the one from Jessica Redpath in Everlook
OR
the one from Marlene Redpath in Western Plaguelands.

(I'm feeling you guys, I know that questmarker triggers the heck out of you)
