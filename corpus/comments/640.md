head into Stormgarde and go to the right, don't go up the ramp.  Just kill defenders.  The drop from these is about 1 in 5.  The good news is the drop is usually more than 1.  I got drops of 2, 3, and 4 sigils.  I thought I was missing something after killing 6 of these guys before getting the first drop. | Subject: "Vindicators"
Vinidicators definately drop them... i just got 3 off of one =D. Troll Hunters are Priests... they cast Shadow Word Pain, Heal, and Sleep. I reccomend using Deathcoil if your a loc and have it when they are casting heal... nice interrupt + damage.

The drop rate is totally random... i killed a defender and got 4 from them, killed 3 hunters in a row and got none... just kill them all.

Coords: 23,60 in Stromgrade | Returning this will allow you to get the quest "Sigil of Thoradin" (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=641). It involves a lot of running back and forth between Stromgarde and Hammerfall. Setting your Hearthstone to Hammerfall will save you one trip. | Subject: "Patience..."
The trick here, especially if you're solo, is to get inside Stromgarde Keep - then just attack Defenders. These Sigils are dropped frequently and in multiples (i.e. I was getting Sigils 4 at a time). Of course you'll need to get through the gates (defended by Defenders (!), but not difficult if you can stealth...). | Subject: "coords"
Enter Stromgarde, turn right and kill the defenders/trollhunters etc. loc. 23,60
