Demons guard each portal. They, along with lesser infernals patrol the area. Try and close the portal when (the partrolling demons)have just moved away from the portal.

A level 39 demon will pass through the portal and immidiatly engage you in combat. Do not fight toe to toe unless you have three or more in your party. Soloist should fight while moving backwards (towards the road). Oh, and watch your back.

Don't let their high level or the fact that they are demons entice you into farming these guys. They are very stingy with their loot. 9 out of 10 times, they drop nothing. | Subject: "easy"
/tloc 50,76    for those of you that want a copy/paste tloc | Run to Mannoroc Coven and use the big ring portals near the road. A level 38 Doomguard appears and attacks you. Defeat him to seal the portal. The portals respawn after about five minutes, so if you don't want to explore the coven, locate three portals and make a loop. Be careful of patrols, several Infernos, Summoners and Doomguards have long patrol routes that take them right next to several portals. | Subject: "2CENTS"

Look for the round portal looking things and right click them to release demon. Kill him to complete a closing. I recommend a 40+ helper.
