# Subject: "Southshore Stout"
An easier means of getting the stout for Valik is going to the Innskeeper of nearby Tarren Mills and buying it for less than 2s.

Beware though, I've seen Valik aggro me when I came back to give him the stout.  Just kill him and wait for him to respawn.  He'll go back to being friendly (learned his lesson, didn't he?). | The Southshore Stout can be picked up from the Drunken Footpad, who wanders around the Syndicate Camp. | Subject: "Side Note..."
You must have the quest Infiltration! before he will talk to you.

Edited, Wed Jan 12 22:34:59 2005 | Confirmed in classic:

Quest giver Valik for Quest: Valik is located at 57, 69.4 (Alterac Mountains, not Hilsbrad Foothills)

Valik will ask for Southshore Stout which can be bought at the innkeepers in Tarren Mill and Southshore.
After giving him the stout, the quest will end, you will get a Syndicate Missive, he will aggro and become kill-able.
You cannot complete this quest if you already have a missive in inventory

This is an alternative to randomly killing syndicate NPCs for Syndicate Missive drops.
