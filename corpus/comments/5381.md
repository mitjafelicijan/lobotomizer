entrance at 56,29 in desolace - actual crystal at 55,26 - lvl 37 demon pops out - be sure to kill all the mobs 1st | Subject: "Getting the crystal"
Lots of level 30-32 mobs around; some spellcasters.  Basically you go in the front gate of the fortress, straight up through the front door of the biggest building, around the circular corridor, and into  the main room.  By this time, unless you can stealth, there are probably a dozen dead bodies in your wake.  Inside the main room are another 8 or so.  The crystal is in the middle; whack it with your pickaxe and a level 37 demon presents itself to be dismembered.
The hand is loot on the demon's body. | Subject: "Coords"
Are you all such idiots? Post coords great, maybe some tactical pointers. But who gives a damn if you pwned some nubs. I don't care... Anyone coming here for assistance doesn't give a damn either. | Go into Thunder Axe Fortress and in the middle of the first big building, you will find a large red crystal. Clear all the enemies in the room then use the crystal. A level 37 demon will appear. Defeat this demon to get the box. | Pick up https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1435 since you're going to the fortress. | https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5741

Is also a quest in the fortress.
