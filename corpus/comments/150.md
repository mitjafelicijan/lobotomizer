Goddamit, I hate those murlocs. | Subject: "location"
I actually found this much easier on the southern bank, around 49,71.

The drop rate was better and it was easier to see what I was doing/take them on one at a time.

Got a fair few sunfish too :) | Subject: "Camp East of Lakeshire"
Location of Murlocs is 39,45.

There are some on the island itself though you may have to dive under the water to get the rest that you need.

Had to swim around a few to get the 8/8 that I needed.

Murloc Fins are NOT quest items so you can log on your main, grind those annoying *!@#$es in 3 seconds and mail all the fins to your alt. | You find a murloc camp at loc 40,44. | Subject: "Dockmaster Baren"
I got it from Dockmaster Baren in Lakeshire
