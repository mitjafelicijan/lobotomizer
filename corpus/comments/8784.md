# You should save them until 2999/3000 neutral, as you only get rep for killing C'thun and Emps from that point and then turn all in. | This quest is from a low random drop, Ancient Qiraji Artifact, off the mobs inside of AQ40. Turning this in to the Brood of Nozdormu at the start of the instance rewards you with 1000 rep as stated above, which makes the effort to getting to exalted much easier.

It is a very low chance to drop, but has a chance on practically every mob in the instance aside from bosses. You can have none drop, or as many as 3 drop, which happened to my guild one time, made everyone very happy. | Subject: "secrets of the qiraji hidden dragons"
