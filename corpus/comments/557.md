seems to be that there are 2 camps....one near the Lorderon Internment Camp....and then another one further North; directly on the east side of the shield.  Go to the 2nd one and you'll have better luck.  You'll also notice there are many more elementals there. =) | Subject: "<Blank>"
Bracers from elemental slaves can be found at 22,66 in dalaran | Easy, just kill the elemental slaves in Dalaran. Double this quest up with Dalaran Patrols for easy xp. | Subject: "lol"
i think its hilarious how people complain about drop rates... its made like that so you spend time grinding to get what you need... personally if i didnt have a goal to killing something endlessly i get bored real quick. so its nice to have these quests that force you to grind (most of the time... some of ya get lucky). | The drop rate on these is not very good, but I uploaded all the data on these from wowhead client the location is 20, 59 in Alterac Mountains. Watch out for the summoners they will summon these ghosts that are a pain in the rear. Also if you are on a PvP server allies will come by and kill you so keep a watch out.
