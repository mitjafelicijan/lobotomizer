This quest is still active, but this is one hell of a drop.

The drop rate is absolutely awful.

Don't go to the Cliffspring Falls. There are 2 guys there, and the chances of you getting it are astronomical.

Go to the Master's Glaive if you really want this quest. There are about 14 people there, and the respawn rate is exceptionally high. Keep going around and around the glaive, killing the level 16/17/18s until it drops.

And it will take a while.

It took me, literally, about 120 to get the book. And on the 120th, I said to myself, 'This is definately the last one, I'm tired of this now', and pow, it dropped.

Keep at it. | skip it, it will take you at least an hour
