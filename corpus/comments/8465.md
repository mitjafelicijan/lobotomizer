Salfa is actually right outside of the Winterspring Tunnel that leads from Felwood - literally.

But just in case, coordinates are (27,34) | Subject: "Finding Salfa"
Salfa is on the Winterspring side of the Timbermaw Hold tunnel leading from Felwood (where quest is picked up) to Winterspring and Moonglade.

Tunnel splits, so if you come out in Moonglade, go back in and find the other tunnel.Â  Little difficult, but it you know it's there it shouldn't take too long to find.
