City of Ironforge (51, 14) | Subject: "Where to hand the q in."
You begin the quest at Kharanos with the rogue trainer inside the Inn at lvl 10.

You hand the quest in Ironforge at the Forlorn Cavern. go up the building where the shady dealer is standing outside. Once inside walk down the stairs and your guy is there.Â 

It's clearly visable once you get inside the forlorn cavern.
