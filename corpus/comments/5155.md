If you go into the "Lair" at 39,59 Cosmo Coords, then there are several of each type.

There are usually 1-2 Hounds and 1-2 Guardians outside... as Guardians are the 'worker ants' they are the easiest to pick off.

I'm a level 51 hunter, and I pulled this off solo, but it took me a few minutes. (I'm not the most leet) | Located in Jaedenar. NW of the Emerald Sanctuary.
Coords: 39,58 (entrance)
There are 2 caves you can go into. Both have what you need to kill, with some scattered outside as well. | Subject: "Experience/Reputation"
At level 51 I got 4900 XP for this - there was no reputation adjustment. | cords to entrance: 39.58 | Subject: "Don't die"
Don't die in the caves hell of a long run | You can also find the Cultists up the hill, but I would advise if you can do get the Cultists inside the first tunnel as they are plentiful. Be prepared for 2 mob pulls. If you can't handle that just search outside. It took 20 minutes for respawns so it can take a bit.
