# Kernda is under the bridge in the tunnel. She's the only Furbolg blue color. You have to be Neutral with Timbermaw Hold to turn in the quest. | Subject: "Gaining Reputation"
If you are UNFRIENDLY you CAN NOT talk to them yet. You have to be NEUTRAL. To become neutral you have to keep killing the deadwood and turning in feathers. Let's say your rep says unfriendly 2670/6000 and after you kill one it says 2675/6000. THATS GOOD. You want the number to go up, because once it reaches 6000/6000 you will become Neutral. I dont know the exact numbers, those were hypothetical. | Subject: "Finding Kendra"
I hope this helps you Sibunis and anyone else who has trouble finding the NPC Kendra to turn in the totem and complete the quest. Just as you are crossing the wooden bridge inside the hold, at tloc 66,3, there is a lighted pathway on the right that descends into another tunnel. There you will find Kendra and this tunnel leads to Moonglade which I had read that you could reach from Felwood but had never found the path to it before. I hope this helps.
