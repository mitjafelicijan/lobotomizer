Solo'd them all as a 70 prot warrior.
Hey, I was seeking revenge, leave me alone! | Subject: "she pats"
she pats from tyr's hand to stratholme live entrance following the road.Â  this should hopefully answer previous questions. | If you are a mage, you can definitely solo this quest by sheeping the Courier and then aoe down the 4 elite bodyguards as shown by Faxmonkey.

You can also solo this quest as a priest by using Mind Control on each of her bodyguards separately, let them die while under MC and then run away. Once all the bodyguards are dead, pull her toward the Argent Dawn's camp North of Blackwood Lake (not Light Hope's Chapel) and have the NPCs there help you kill her. The funny thing is that if you are still holding aggro, she will chase after you but she will be daze since 6 lvl 59/60 are wacking at her. Once she is daze, it's pretty much over and you can kite her however you like.

A word of caution: Don't try to kite her and her 4 bodyguards to the camp because the 5 elites are just too much 6 non-elites can handle. I tried this before, and the bodyguards slaughtered all the NPCs.
