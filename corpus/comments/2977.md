well in case anyone came to thottbot today to find out WHERE they could find historian karnik to complete the last part of this quest and not read everyones little e-thoughts on it, well this post is for you.

you'll find him in the hall of explorers in Ironforge, you'll see the little yellow dot on your minimap. When you turn it in, he'll only give you alittle xp. He then tells you to talk to one more person. He is located about 20 "e-feet" away from him. (Don't you LOVE those?) And that guy gives you alot more XP + Gold.

There I said it.
