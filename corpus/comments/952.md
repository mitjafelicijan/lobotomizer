# Subject: "Keep going!"
The big question I always hear is, "where is the Grove of the Ancients?" People will run south, get to about Ameth Aran, and then turn around, thinking they missed it. KEEP GOING. You have to run past Ameth Aran, over the Windbend River, and there'll be a signpost on your right. The Grove is directly to your left. It's a circle of stone with a giant tree-man shambling around. | Subject: "Finding the Ancient Grove"
I had a bit of trouble finding the Ancient Grove.

To get there, run south until you get to the forked river. Cross both bridges and turn left along the river's southern bank. Eventually you will come to a set of ruins. Onu is in the ruined rotunda with two human NPCs.
