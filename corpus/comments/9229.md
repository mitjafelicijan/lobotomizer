# This is a random drop off a trash mob in Naxx. Everyone in the raid can pick it up. | You must complete Echoes of War first for this quest to become available from the NPC in Light's Hope Chapel. | If you pay attention you'll notice that Ramaladni is Indalamar spelled backwards.
If you don't know who Indalamar is, check this out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zNFcYZfxjQ

Hats for to blizz for these jabs at the community. :)
