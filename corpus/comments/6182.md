75, 59 | TBC Classic prepatch, it appears boosted characters are not able to receive this quest. I have this quest but boosted friend is not receiving it. She is Honored with Stormwind and level 60. The two requirements (56+) and (Honored) have been met. Perhaps due to boosted characters never having been level 56 where the first quest trigger is met besides being Honored. Unfortunately yet another one of the unintended consequences of adding something that was never included with vanilla or TBC original.

Update: Scanning the forums I see others are mentioning similar issues with The First and The Last.

I got pointed to it from Justine Demalier, First he said:

Justine Demalier says: That One, Malagan. I know him. Dependable, brave, abd trustworthy. Force is his name.

Then few min later (was stil standing there idling)

Merlis Malagan Says: Force, eh? Oy! Citizen Force, Come 'ere. Highlord Bolvar Fordragon has requested that all able bodied heroes o' the alliance meet with him at Stormwind Keep. You just been recruited, mate! Get a move on!

Then i got the quest from "Highlord Bolvar Fordragon" in SW Keep. Meby you need to get pointed to it from those 2 in stormwind :)
