74,79 | The evidence can be found in Duskwood, inside the cave Roland's Doom, coordinates 73, 79. | Subject: "MAPS People are a GREAT Thing!!"
I would like to respond to all those that couldnt find this place!

I am a 31 druid and had absolutly no problems finding Rolands Cave at the location of 73,74. there are a few Nightbane's and one or two Gutspill's and range from level 29-31.

I had no problems killing them all (Even took an add or two for fun!).

Finding the mound of dirt was no problem! click and get out before they all start spawning or Hearth back to the inn.Â 

Remember that this is in "DUSKWOOD"

It's all the way in back of the cave marked Roland's Doom on the map.
