He can be found at 25,44, up ontop of the spiral tower, there is a leper up there so be careful but 1ce u have killed him it is easy. | Subject: "stealthed"
As a lvl 10 Dwarf Rogue, I stealthed around Gnomeregan but couldn't find him, the reason being, he's stealthed. When you take the road to Gnomeregan, follow the road to the end, you'll go just past a machine with green stuff spitting out, there's a tower with path up to the top, there's a lvl 10 Leper there, I attacked him but nothing happened so I got the quest from the npc.
