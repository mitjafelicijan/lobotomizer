# Quest ID: 5058
# Quest Title: Mrs. Dalson's Diary
# Quest URL: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5058
# Okay, here we go, the Diary is at 47.50 (the barn at Dalson's Tears), put up a screen shot of it. Now, after you grab the quest, run out to behind the barn and find a Wandering Skeleton (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=10816). He drops a key that opens the outhouse, it's against the tree stump. When you use the key, it will release Farmer Dalson, a level 56 undead (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=10836). Kill him, grab the key, and run in the nearby house and up the stairs, there you will find a cabinet. Goal, score!
Linked with the Locked Away quest, (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5060). | This is how to do it:

1) Click on Mrs. Dalson's Diary in the barn. Will write completed. No exp or next quest.
2) Loot a  Dalson Outhouse Key from nearby Wandering Skeleton undead mob.
3) Go to Outhouse at the back of the barn & house and open ith with the key. This will spawn Farmer Dalson.
4) Kill Farmer Dalson to loot  Dalson Cabinet Key.
5) Go to 2nd floor of the house. There will be a locked cabinet. Use the key to open it and complete quest.

Good hunting!

EDIT: Thanks for the hint about Wandering Skeleton :)

Go behind the barn and house, kill Wandering Skeleton for it's key
Right click the Outhouse and kill the mob and pickup his key.
Right click the cabinet in the upper floor of the house.
Done. | The issue people are having with this quest chain and being unable to open the outhouse appears to be related to layering. I ran into the issue and was able to get the chain completed by being invited to group with someone from another layer.
