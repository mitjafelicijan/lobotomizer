First, I am not very impressed by the directions on this one, Talo must be losing his memory.

Yes, as he says, they are found west of Mojache, but then they are also quite far north, therefore north-west would be a better description.

Follow the road west adn then north, past the Twin Colassals and just before you hit Desolace you'll see ruins on your left (westof the road). Here you will find many lovely harpies all waiting to be roasted and toasted (Okay I used fireballs). Happy Hunting. | Subject: "coords"
40,14.. follow the road around the mountains | Subject: "hint..."
Be sure to pick up 'Dark heart' quest before you go there, because you have to kill these harpies too, to get the horn, which you blow and kill some boss-bird -> https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1629
