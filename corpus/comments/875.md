There are a ton of slayers in a circle around a cleft of trees at:

/tloc 40,16 | Subject: "EASY"
Go to about 40,16.  Far NW corner of Barrens.  There are harpys all over but don't waste your time on the first ones you see!  Try to get around to the very, very far northern end of this area by walking on the right edge. There you'll find all the rings.  I think I got all 6 in under 10 kills. Good luck! | Subject: "38, 14"
