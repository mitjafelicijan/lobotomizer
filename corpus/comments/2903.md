There are at the camp at 71,55 on top of a crate. Kinda hard to see. | Subject: "How to do it"
Easy! Get a coordinations mod, run to the camp at 72,56. Clear the camp, take the plans; wasn't so difficult, huh? The only trick is to slaughter the Woodpaw gnolls, but that's a secondary matter.

Those of you who choose to modify your game interface shouldn't be too hard on those who don't ... in any case, the plans are in one of the small camps, this one with 4 guys on top of course.  It is on a small hill sort of in the middle of the gnoll area, sitting on top of a box.  If you can stealth you will have no trouble working your way in!  I did solo it at level 43 druid although it was kind of close - gl!
