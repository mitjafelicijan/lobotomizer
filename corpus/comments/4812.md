This quest is easy...

The moonwell is RIGHT next to the person who gives you this quest. 37,43 if you REALLY need the co-ordinates.

The next bit is so easy that theres no need to even bother using co-ordinates or whatever.
You should KNOW where the damn crystal is cause you just seen it from the previous quest. It's THE SAME CRYSTAL AS BEFORE!:S
48,49 are the co-ords for the crystal.
For those without co-ordinates.. Stand directly under the D in Auberdine, on the map... The crystal is Directly east of that.

The only... remotley ... 'difficult' part is cutting through the moonkin to get to it. Even though.. you've already done it once... If you're new at the game you might have your hands full, but if you can pull mobs away from the crowd then you'll be fine.

I cant see why anyone needs help on this quest...

Fight your way to the crystal, click it to pour the water over it and get the next quest. All that takes is getting back to Auberdine. You need co-ordinates for that too? �.� | Subject: "How to do"
Fill up the vial with water from the town moonwell then take it right back to the crystal that you just looked at. | Subject: "<Blank>"
