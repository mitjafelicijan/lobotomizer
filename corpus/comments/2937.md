34,72 Standing on top of the alter.  On the Hill by the lake.  Not need to go up any of the steps.
Big battle - see posts of pictures below | Gadrin's Parchment is a one-use item. If you summon Shadra, the parchment is gone regardless if you actually kill the spider. However, if you don't kill the spider, *abandon the quest* and travel back to Master Gadrin in Senjin Village (Durotar). My advice - don't burn your parchment trying to solo Shadra unless you want the challenge. A group of 3 or more lvl 50+ players is recommended.

Travel tip if you have to go back to Master Gadrin: Fly to Ratchet, get on the ship and ride it to the point of Durotar closest to Senjin Village and jump off - save you some swimming at least.
