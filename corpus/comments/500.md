you do NOT need to kill the elite ogres.Â  the normal ogres lvl 35 are easy to kill with about a 1/3 drop rate. they are all next to /tloc 50,58. | Dirty knucklebones drop at a decent rate off the non-elite ogres just before the city. The best way to reach the non-elites is to travel up the road towards Taren Mill, and past it into the Alterac Mountains. Careful for the elite Deathguards, their aggression radius is fairly large!

If you're low-level (Under 35), I'd strongly suggest avoiding the elite ogres just inside the gates!!

Not a bad, quest, and when coupled with Preserving Knowledge, it gives a fair amount of experience. For Preserving Knowledge, it would be a very good idea to bring a group with you!

Hang onto that group, and tackle the Crushridge Warmongers followup quest while you're at it!
