aKa Slimeball...! | The corrupted moonwell is at (32,66) Felwood, surrounded by level 50-52 Jadefire satyrs and a named boss, Xavathras (54). | Also note, to get here, you need to come from the south, not the north. If you're coming from Bloodvenom post, you want to get off the road somewhere aroun 42,66. Coming from the north will only get you lost in the mountains surrounded by angry orcs. | Subject: "Wrong Quest"
Most of the comments posted on this page are about the wrong quest.The well you want the sample is NOT in Jaedenar.That well is for the quest "Collection of the Corrupt Water".The well for this quest,"Well Of Corruption",is in THE RUINS OF CONSTELLAS.Just follow the path all the way to the back and you will see it.So people please make sure that the quest you are commenting on is the right one and quit comfussing the hell out of people. | Follow up Quest:
