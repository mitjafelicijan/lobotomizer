Of where you picked up the quest.  Go back to the little hut and go N up the hill and you'll see the Eastern crystal on the right.  After placing the stone at its base 3 lvl 10 mobs will be attracted to it.  But don't worry they are pretty easy.  They start attacking your crystal that you have on the ground.  I attacked all 3 of them to get aggro off the crystal, then took them down one by one.  Again, they were pretty easy for lvl 10's.  Though I did have to bubble and heal once. AFter they died more started coming but then they stopped and dissappeared.  After a moment my quest read complete. | This is actually a bit of a tough quest for a starting character. After placing the crystal, quite a few shades appear and attack the crystal. With a young priest character I have not been able to kill all shades, but it's not actually needed to slay them. You can kite them until a minute is up and you get the "completed" message. Then just run away and turn in the quest. | Subject: "Location"
I used the Infused Crystal in my bag at the base of the Runestone Shan'dor (55,84).  Two waves of about three lvl 9 wraiths spawned...killed them, quest shows done!
