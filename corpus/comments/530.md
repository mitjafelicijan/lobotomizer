# Actually it's not a castle, it's the Gilneas Gate. lore has it that Gilneas sealed itself off from the rest of the world to prevent the Scourge from invading. it's hoped that someday Blizz will open the zone. | Subject: "<Blank>"

Valdred Moray wanders back in forth in front of the wall. If you are on the road facing the wall he will start in front of the "gate" then wander to the right towards a cluster of people. He will go back and forth between these two points constantly. The key is to get him in between, otherwise you will pull far more than intended.

My best advice is to pull him back to the road. There is a fence that lines the road here. Pull to where the fence ends. You will avoid getting beast type aggros from the back. If you pull Valdred at the right time he shouldn't bring any buddies. If it is one on one, anyone 18+ should be able to get him fairly easily. | Subject: "Easy Button"
Soloed as L17 Mage. The only problem was avoiding the Son of Arugal. He was in the area and I wasn't prepared for a 25 Elite so I hid from him. Otherwise, pull Raleigh and rip him a new one. No difficulty at all.
