There's a patrol of 3 lvl 21 elites in the area that you walk through that can aggro to the NPC... If they do I recommend just letting him die and going back for the quest. | Subject: "If you die"
If you happen to die (due to the above-mentioned Patrol), abandon the quest and go back to Miran.Â  You'll be able to re-start from there.
