87,66 area. you will start to see prowlers off the road (eastern end of road)to your left hand side | This quest is quite spread out throughout eastern Elwynn. Directly north of the guard who gives you the quest is a Prowler den, which contains about 4 or 5 prowlers depending on the respawn, and the bears are scattered across Elwynn's eastern side completely sporatically. If you want to be able to do this quest faster though, there is a huge encampment east called the Eastvale Logging Camp which contains lots of Prowlers and Bears outside of it, along with the proper materials for the "A Bundle of Wood" quest. I suggest going to Eastvale to complete this quest.
