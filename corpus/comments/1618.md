=) | If you're looking at the comments on this recipe, plan, or quest you might be a collector or completionist.
This is a compiled list of all of the cross-faction recipes in the game.

Most (not all)  Cooking recipes on the Alliance side are sold by Kendor Kabonka. The Horde do not have a corresponding NPC, so if you are an Alliance character wanting to create an alt on the opposite side to obtain the recipes for your main, unfortunately you'll have to have a level appropriate character to do the quests to obtain some of these recipes.

All of the recipes except one ( Plans: Orcish War Leggings) can be traded cross-faction on the neutral AH.
