Plenty of them in the north west corner around Sven Yorgen and Lars in their camp. Approx cords are 10,40 | Subject: "10.66 - 10.40"
These coordinates are correct, you can find the spiders along the border with Westfall, along with other kinds of spiders and wolves. Respawn rate isn't very high, so kill off other beasts to have them spawn quicker. Just run from south to north and back again a few times. Won't take you more than 20 minutes.
Look around before you go after one if your level isn't very high, cause otherwise there'll be 3 spiders and a wolf on top of you in no time.
