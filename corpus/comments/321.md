the wreckage is directly to the south of menethil harbor (exact coordinates are 12. 64), you dont have to go out of the town, one ingot is in a chest on the ship, the others ones you have to get on the murloc's around the area (either underwater or in thier camps)

as for the debate on whether the drops are more common when you are near the ship, im not sure. all i know is that i was killing murloc raiders in baradin bay (the area directly west/left of the ship) and they were still dropping the lightforge ingots | The chest is on the small island in the middle of the boat just south-east of the inn of Menethil.

go due south of the inn, it's right there | Subject: "Drop on LIghtforge ingot"
Ok the first part of the quest you go straight south out of menethial by the gryphon
You will see on you map and mini-map what looks like an island. It is an island and it has a ship broken over it. In the middle of the ship is a grass hill. On that hill are a number of boxes. One small box will turn your cursor into the gear wheel which mean s you can pick something up.
You will in all likey hood have to fight a couple of 29 murlocs. On the boat. Once you complete the quest another quest pops up for getting five more bars. You can do this quest. The drop rate is poor so figure you will kill about 12-14 murlocs for your 5 bars. It should be good XP anyway. All the murlocs in the water drop them. I worked my way out the bay and was still getting lightforge some distance from the boat. | Subject: "Experience"
650 xp at level 31 (when the quest is yellow)

Edited, Tue Jan 11 20:48:25 2005 | You can the the Lightforge Ingot at 12,64 in a chest. Then this leads into https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=324 and you kill the murlocs around the ship to get the rest of the Ingot. | Subject: "the real cords"
