4a) its a becouse i just rember you should do this, open your bag and put the parachute on your bar
5) read the whole next part till the end then continue
6) JUMP OFF (i did this in travel form and then shapshifted out)
7) count to 5, not 1 missisppi 2, but 1 2 3 4 5, normal speed like
8) click the parachute, you could wait longger in fact i opened mine to fast couse i dropped like three feet to the water but if i was over land at the time i would not have died the thing is wait till you think your close to the ground then hit it it stops you instantly | never try to perform this jump mounted...
and dont try to jump to the north. you'll prolly land near some dragonkin lvl 60 or so... they killed my shammy lvl 54 with 2 hits O.o
