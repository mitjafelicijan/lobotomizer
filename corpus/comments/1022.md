# To reach the vale you travel north toward Felwood and look west until you see a sloping path. The path has a few worgen and leads up to a cave at 53, 38. Go through the cave and you'll find the shrine on the other side. The book is on a table just in front of the shrine. | 55,32 you will see a path that leads up to the cave where you will find the book on a table. This is the correct cords..... | Subject: "For those of you without cosmos..."
The location "53,58" means nothing to people without cosmos.  So if your'e like me and don't have it, heres what to do for this quest:
Follow the road north towards Felwood, and on the WEST side of the road there is a path that leads up to a cave entrance.  On the map, it uses the cave symbol.  Thats what made me go crazy about this quest, I assumed the shrine couldn't possibly be in a cave. Well it is.  Go through the cave passage and youll find a green ziggurat like thing at the other side.  Kill about 20 of the wolf dudes and then read the tome. | Subject: "location of the cave to enter Howling Vale"
it's at (52,37).  The book is on a table outside but close to the building. | Path up to the cave starts @ 54.2, 32.5 | Subject: "Experience"
2450 XP at 34, when the queat is green.
