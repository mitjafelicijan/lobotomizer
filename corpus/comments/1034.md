I got 1850 exp from this at LVL 21. I think something is wrong with the information provided here. | Subject: "<Blank>"
This is fairly easy to do.
Straight to the south of Astranaar is a small pond with an island in the center. Mobs are lvl 23 elementals. Dust is from bushes you harvest. | Subject: "It isn't at 36,69!"
I went to 36,69 and all there was was a path. It wasn't an isle of any kind it was a path next to a lake! So don't follow those co-ordinates here are the real co-ordinates. The co-ordinates are for the middle of the island an watch out the isle is full of level 22 Elementals. The co-ordinates are:

33,67 | If you get to the island and don't see any Stardust at all, be patient. Somebody has just been there (in my case, a Druid) and collected it all. It will re-appear after 4-10 minutes and you'll be so busy killing those fiendish thingies on the island, you won't even notice how long it takes.
