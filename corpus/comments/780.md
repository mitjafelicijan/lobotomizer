You can find these at 55,84, for those with out Cosmo its in front of the Brambleblade Ravine. | Welcome, young Tauren, to the first step in the vast plains of Mulgore and Azeroth beyond! I've paused to just post a small list of quests you should be sure to pick up before venturing into the Brambleblade Ravine area...

- Rite of Strength: Collect the belts off of the Quillboars inside the ravine. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=757)

- Break Sharptusk!: Master piggie can be found in a central clearing in a tent. Clear his minions and proceed in for his head. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3376)

** Attack on Camp Narache: For an extra quest, head up the path going right [near Sharptusk's tent]. Kill the boars inside and click on the map on the cave floor to begin the quest. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=781)

* Shaman: The Quillboar shaman within provide the salve you need for your Call of Earth quest. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1519)

My post is quite vague, but it's merely a set of guidelines. Feel free to act as you wish. After all, I am not you, you are you! Have fun, and may you have the Earthmother's blessing.
