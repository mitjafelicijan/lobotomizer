The best place to do this quest is 36,50 there is a lot of fire elements there :D | Do you want to complete this quest? Kill all the trash mobs.

Basillisks, treants, etc and flame elementals. They have the same spawn timer.

Tsunaman is on a cliff on the out skirts of the town.  If you cross the pond in town there is a trail out the backside of the town.  He is off that trail up a cliff. 

location  47,64 | Please ignore the comment saying not to do this quest, doing this quest at the same time as "Harpies Threaten" https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=6282 will ensure you getting and easy 4100exp combined. Slain quests are the easiest quests to do and when you have this quest in the same area with a 100% drop rate I think not doing this quest would be pointless, you WILL easily see 10 fire elementals while doing this. At the same time https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=6381 this quest will need doing, the mounds are scattered throughout the area so add another 2000exp to your total exp. | Subject: "tsunaman's coordinates"
he's at 47,64.  follow the trail going to charred vale, take the first left, can't miss him.  his camp is overlooking sun rock retreat.
