# Go after Shadowforge Darkweaver and Shadowforge Tunneler. An obvious place to hunt them is "Hammertoe's Digsite" (52, 33).

Don't forget to pick up "Crumpled Map" lying on the upper level of the camp (south side), which starts the quest "A Sign of Hope" (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=720).

Watch out for the patrols though (they come in threes). | Subject: "Experience"
