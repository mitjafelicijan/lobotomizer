# Enter the cave at 45,8.

Directions to the box:
Follow the tunnel.
At the first fork go right down the incline (left is a dead end).
Keep going forward, do not turn and go down into the cavern below.
You will run into a bunch of boxes. Look around, the chest is in with them. | Subject: "where the kurzen elites are"
As soon as you start seeing the Kurzen Elites, you'll see a ton of boxes and barrels.

They are the first bunch of boxes you come across. Look for the strongbox with a lock on it. It's different from all the rest in the bunch - can't miss it.

As a 38 druid, I stealthed through, hunched up in a corner, pulled 2 singles (which cleared the way) - grabbed the box and stealthed back out. Done. | Subject: "Clearer Directions"
Ok, those directions weren't too clear to me so I will try and straighten things out. Go into the cave and stick to the right wall, you dont need to turn just follow the curve of the cave. Just after a ramp down to the left, you will rind a room with a lot of crates with Elites and Witch Doctors, it is in there. | Subject: "close to entrance"
its on the way to the Colonel, down the right ramp. Its up on the platform on the right side of the tunnel.Â  My char. is looking straight at it.
