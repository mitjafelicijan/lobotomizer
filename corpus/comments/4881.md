# Quest URL: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4881
# Coords are 21, 32 <or> just west of the Great Lift... (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=10617)

- Walk west to main path... follow that north and you'll see it just up on the left.
- Follow on quest has 3 lvl 27/28 attack.
- I used a heal potion and was able to take care of them as a 33 hunter (w/o pet out, I was just passing through)

Good Luck! | Subject: "Finding Galak Messenger"
To find the mob Galak Messenger, which drops the "Assassination Note", which starts this quest, just wait at the intersection at location 29,34 and for those who don't have coords, it is the first intersection south of the great lift that leads to either Freewind Post or Whitereach Post.

Have fun!
