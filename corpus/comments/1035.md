The Moonstone is a drop from the Lvl 30 Oracle on the island. | around 66, 82. | On the small island at Fallen Sky Lake. Co-ords for 66,82 are correct. | What's this nonsense about "the only orcale worth killing" HE is the only Oracle, PERIOD.
He is located at 66, 81, is level 30, has a few mobs in the area, but he is easily pulled to a safer spot, easy quest, great exp.
