At this point, I assume there are three places where he spawns:

73.41, The northern big tent
74.48, The southern big tent
72.46, Up on the main stage

These are all near each other, anyways. | Found him near the coords marked on the map (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=5600). He was in a big tent. There are about 3 or 4 other Kolkar around, levels 31-32. He's alone in the tent however once you clear the area.
