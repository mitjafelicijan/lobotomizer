For those who don't have a coordinate add-on yet, or just want an extra hint, here's what worked for my lvl 5 warlock...enter the Defias area on the far right side by the river, where it meets the wall. 

Consider the area as a U shape.  Start here:
x
U

Follow the hillside as high up as you can get & you shouldn't attract much, if any, attention of those below.  At the bottom left of the U....xU..will be about as low as you will come to the Defias.  You may need to pause and wait until the current person on guard looks and walks away to continue your run.

As you continue on the bottom part of the U, you'll eventually find that the hillside contours up and that there is a path behind the hillside that will lead you to Garrick's shack at the bottom right side of the U...Ux.  Here you can pause to reflect, buff up or whatever, before you start your battle. Garrick is lvl 5 and his thugmate is lvl 3.  Both will participate in the fight.  I returned the same way I came without any problems.  Good luck! | Garrick Padfoot is located at (57,48) in Northshire Vineyard. He's a level 5, and will have at least one other level 5 with him. He's next to a little shack, which is next to the mountains. Just kill him and take his head!
