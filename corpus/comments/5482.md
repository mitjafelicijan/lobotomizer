Bring WEED to apothecary HOLLAND ? =D | Subject: "info"
This one is easy and you can do it while doing another quest. The best location for the weeds are just north of the mass grave yard on a tiny hill. You really can't miss it. The Doom Weeds clumped in sets of two for me. Found a couple that were just in the middle of the field by itself. Once collected you need to turn in to the Junior Apothecary Holland in the grave yard. Keep in mind he's a wandering mob and if you don't see him just stay on the path and keep your eyes open.

My result:
You gain 550 experience.
You received 1 Silver 25 Copper
