Coords: 49, 85 | Subject: "location"
Enter the underground hive in the south-central portion of the crator. The ramp and entrance are marked on the map as The Slithering Scar. Once inside I just followed the passage left at the first intersection and it took me into the room with hanging larval spawns. Stand inbetween the stones in the center of the room and use the hive scraper. | Subject: "Location"

you have to go into one of the little rooms, theres one to the left and one all the way down the tunnel to the right. You have to scrap from the MIDDLE of the room, not the wall like it makes you think. | You don't even have to clear the room. Using the vial counts as a spell actually and will not be interrupted. | Subject: "Experience/Reputation"
I got 5100 XP for this; there was no reputation adjustment. | Subject: "Location Confirmation!"
