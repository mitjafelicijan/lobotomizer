Obviously, if you're paying attention you don't need this, but make sure to go ahead and talk to Greta again after the spirit is summoned.

Otherwise, you might head all the way back to Felwood without completing the quest.

And, let me tell you, that's an awfully long trip to be kicking yourself the whole time.
