# Quest Title: Augustus' Receipt Book
# Quest URL: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=6164
# The book can be found in the Terrordale inn, which is the largest building in the town. Walk upstairs and turn right. The book lies in the back of the room. | Subject: "The Inn"
More specifically, the inn is the largest building, in the center on the east side of town.  Go upstairs, turn right, and check the floor in the back of the room. | Subject: "Available to Alliance too"
As of 1.11 this quest is now available to Alliance players.

Augustus has moved out of the Terrorweb tunnel and now sits in the corner of Egan's house in Terrordale. | Subject: "Coords"
If you are interested in completing the quest, the receipt book can be found at 17,31.  The inn is obviously the inn just like all other inns that you've been in throughout the game.  :) | Subject: "The other reason to do this quest"
is to have a vendor available in the area to sell trash to when you're farming or questing. | Subject: "Ok"
The correct coordinates are 18,33 as previously corrected. I found the receipt book on the second floor of the inn, in the room to the right. Go inside the room and there should be another room. The book should be inside the second room.
