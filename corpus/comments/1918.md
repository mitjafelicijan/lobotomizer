# Before you are able to pick this item up, you need the quest 'Stonetalon Standstill'. Please make sure to get it, othewise you will waste a lot of time like I did! | Subject: "info"
This mob is found in Mystal Lake at loc 47,70. You can do this at the same time as the 'Stonetalon Standstill' quest. The mob for this is much larger and more powerful than your standard water elemental in the Mystal Lake. I managed to kill him twice and both times he dropped the Befouled Water Globe. You can only have one at a time on you. So, if you're in a group you need to kill him for each person on that quest.

My results:
You gain 550 experience.
Your reputation with Orgrimmar has slightly increased.
