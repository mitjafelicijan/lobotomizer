She's in the INN - second floor. | "It's not as though I can get by as a knife fighter with insults and a sharp tongue alone..."

Anybody else think this is a nod to the insult swordfighting in the Monkey Island series? | If you havent done the the Haunted Isle chain quest in Booty Bay yet, then dont bother going to Alterac to get this......you need that chain of quests to be complete prior to getting this chain.
