# Sometimes the rare elite mob heartrazor will be flying around in this quest area. He is a lvl 32 elite mob and hard to take solo. If you watch his path it is possible to start the quest and get out of his agro range without fighting him. As soon as he flys by the quest NPC start the quest and you should be fine. | The quest starts at 18, 41 up in the Highperch area. Go to the south-eastern "tower" on your map and you will find a narrow path going up the back of the canyon wall. Pao'ka is right on the ledge.

It's pretty straightforward. He doesn't have waves of mobs that attack him like other escort quests, but he does wander right into plenty of wyverns on the way. He's fairly strong and can almost take a wyvern by himself, so if you end up pulling 3 at a time, you can kill your two before killing his. As soon as you're out of combat, his health resets.

He is buffable, unlike some other escort mobs.
