# Path down into the excavation is at around 46, 85.

Found Khazgorm at 47,85, fairly near the little tent place with the Cauldron at the front. Easy to kill.

The Foreman are abit of a pain in the ass 'cos they're few and far between and 2-3 excavators always seem to be in the way of getting to them. All the dwarves try flee when low on health too so try slow/stop them bringing their bearded buddies back with them.

Peace n' gl. | Subject: "Prospector"
The prospector respawns in different places, and then doesn't roam much.  I found him once behind the tent, once at the bottom of the ramp at the very start of the excavation, and once hidden way in the back of the excavation behind a fallen pillar.
The dorfs run when they get low, then you agro more dorfs, so you need some crowd control.  Also they breed like bunnies, but they make a very satisfying thump. | Subject: "Prospector Khazgorm Locations"
As far as I know Prospector Khazgorm spawns in 3 different locations (all 3 are down in the mine pit):

1. In the center
2. Behind the tents
3. Near the back corner past the tents behind the left side of the fallen pilar | Subject: "Gotta kill the guy"

Was standing there and he spawned.
