The best drop rate is around 62,25 to 62,27.
I complete the quest during 60min.
I think better place for it doesnt exist. | Only drops off the turquoise "Stonelash Scorpid" mobs, not any of the other Stonelash <enter other name here> yellow mobs that may spawn around the same areas. | Subject: "<Blank>"
Around 55,25
There are also some snakes for [55] Securing the Supply Lines | Subject: "<Blank>"
I found the spiders and scorpions plentiful at around 37,21 between the Crystal Vale and Hive Ashi. Hope it helps =] | Subject: "Following Quest"

The drop rate on these items isn't the greatest, but these guys are easily soloable by anyone tough enough to be in Silithus. Easiest place to do it is just West of Cenarion Hold outside of the Twilight camp. Plenty of spiders and scorpions around, plus some of the sandworms you need for a different quest. | If you're here because of a leveling guide such as the one on legacy-wow and it's telling you to pick up this quest along with many others: these quests appear to not be in phase 1 of Classic.
