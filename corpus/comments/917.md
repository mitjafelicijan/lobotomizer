Go to the cave to the North. Go in the cave, you may need to kill a few spiders. Head straight down the passage than you'll come a folk, two to the right and one to the left. Take the one to the North East. This will take to through to a "left or right" spot, go left. This will take you to a hook bend, after the hook bend, the eggs are infront of you. Take a wide birth to the right and you will only have to take on two spiders. I've now done this solo as a lvl 5 NE Hunter twice and lvl 5 NE Druid once. | Subject: "Crown of the Earth Series"
The "Crown of the Earth" quest series is rather tricky to get started.  You can't pick it up in the middle, apparently, but must start in the Dark Elf newbie zone of Aldrassil.

First talk to Gilshalan Windwalker in Aldrassil at tloc 58,42.  Right-click on him even if he does not have a quest icon above his head.  You need to do his two quests:
Webwood Venom
Webwood Egg
After completing "Webwood Egg", Right-click on him again (even if he does not have a quest icon above his head).  This time he gives you:
Tenaron's Summons
Go up the ramp next to Gilshalan all the way to the top room and talk to Tenaron Stormgrip who will give you the first "Crown of Earth" quest.
Crown of the Earth
You are now hooked up and completing each quest will automatically get you the next one in the series.
