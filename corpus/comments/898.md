This quest is a pain. Once he's out of the hold, he has to walk through the pirates, but instead of just walking by them he charges every one. And he enjoys taking out entire camps. I was a 23 priest and he still died after aggroing a camp of 5 or 6 pirates. He's one sucky tank. | If someone has already started the quest, Gilthares will not be sitting in the bottom of the tower as he normally would be doing. If you want to accept this quest and he isn't there, you'll have to wait until the other party finishes the quest before he will respawn and allow you to accept it. | This is one of those escort quests, and it's a long one. To complicate matters, Gilthares likes to initiate combat.

Couple of things to note: 1) As with other escort quests, there are occasions where mobs don't attack. They'll just follow along behind for awhile. This can save you the trouble of killing them, however, if the escortee stops (such as for an 'ambush' or to fight a different mob), the ones following will attack. 2) There are no ambushes on this escort quest, there won't be a time where 2 or 3 come out of nowhere. However, you will need to clear away pretty much everything between Northwatch and Ratchet. | Subject: "fading away"
he mentions to stay close.  there are a lot of escort quests out there that if you get to far away, they'll fail out.  This is probably one of them. | Subject: "Not worth doing"
This quest takes atleast 20 minutes since he walks so slow the whole way and you have to kill like 50 pirates and atleast 15-20 theramore guys all for like 1850 exp. You could get much more exp faster just grinding or doing different quests. | Subject: "Hmm..."
Can anyone tell me where he is?
i�ve been looking for him a while now and would appreaciate an answer as soon as possible :D

thx | I believe NPC spawn timer is about 18 minutes and quest takes about 12 minutes.

Atleast for me, the previous group accepted the quest at 13:42:15 ST, we accepted the quest at 15:00:03 (waited a bit for everyone to accept) and we completed the quest at 14:12:15. Spawn timer might be effected from the previous group's speed.

I believe only one person needs to get the quest, I didn't accept the quest but when someone in our group accepted it and started it a pop-up came for me and I got the quest from that pop-up. However, some other guy who accepted the quest from the NPC was not able to give in, only the guy who started the quest (I mean the walk) and the people who accepted the quest from from the pop-up was able to turn in. This might be a bug tho.
