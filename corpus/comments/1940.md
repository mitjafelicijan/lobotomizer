Don't waste your time searching for Carrion Recluse Spiders as the quest says. They're the green ones that roam around the bank near the river and inside of the graveyard.

Instead, Black Widow Hatchlings to the east of Raven Hill Cemetary drop them all the time and are much, much more common. There's at least 20 or 30 of them to the east of the cemetary. | Subject: "Tip"
Fly to westfall and go to Duskwood from there it's closer. | Subject: "Confirmed"
Raven Hill Cemetary , Kill Green Spiders , 100% Drop Rate | Subject: "m4ko"
Spiders are located on the graveyard in the NW of Duskwoods.

Droprate with me was 100% (8 kills -> 8 silks)

Reward item is not very nice. But the exp is quite nice and the quest is fast (griffin to Darkshire -> walk to graveyard, kill 8 spiders -> teleport back)

Took me 10minutes or so and got me a decent item to disenchant and a whopping 4~5k exp (including spiders) | Here are the rewards for this quest:
