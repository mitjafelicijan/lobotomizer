# If you get the chance, try to find Lady Vespia as she seems to drop the ring as well. I did this a a lvl 21 Rogue with no trouble at all. Lady V. was on her tod on the main shore by the island at 9, 16. As she was a lvl 22 it was a breeze. | You get this quest from https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1007

Ruuzel patrols around the island 7,15 with two other naga guys. | Subject: "He is at:"
You can find him at: 06, 14 | Subject: "<Blank>"
I should note that I got the ring off of lady Vespia who was walking along the shore, immediately adjacent to the island.
