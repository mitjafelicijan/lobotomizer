Apparently, (as of 5/21/07) if you back up a ways behind the quest giver right after you accept the quest, the 3 quest spawns will stand there briefly without aggroing your or the quest NPC and then despawn, then quest comeplete! | When doing this quest is best to step back a bit from her because there will be about 3-4 mobs coming from the direction of the undeads.

If you're standing to close they'll all start attacking you instead of her. Most of you will not be able to take the beating of all the mobs :)
