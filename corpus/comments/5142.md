I found her at 36-90
Her doll is in pices,
head 39-90
Left side 39-92
Right side 39-92

Watch for the ghost's that pop up they are level 55 and can see trough stealth. | Pamela Redpath is in the western house in Darrowshire wandering around. I found her at 36,90
Her doll is in pieces:
-Head 39,90
-Left side 39,92
-Right side 39,92
The head is in the small house and the other 2 pieces are in the bigger house.
Watch for the ghosts that pop. They are level 55 and can see through stealth. You need to open your bag once you have all 3 pieces of the doll and right click on them to put them together. GL and have fun! | You can either have this quest or  Sister Pamela. Not both.
 Sister Pamela gives less XP though so get this one if you can.
