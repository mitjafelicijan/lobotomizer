Don't be "scared" that you need 50 of these.

The mobs can drop up to 10 some times, very quick quest to do! | My wife and I just did this quest and tried the worgs in the SE near the dragonkin. Every once in a GREAT while we got a couple, but got 50 each in just a few minutes on the orcs near the Pillar of Ash area. | Subject: "Loc"
