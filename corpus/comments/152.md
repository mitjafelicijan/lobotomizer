Starting location:
Next to the lighthouse Southern Westfall coastline (30.86)

Oracles:
Right at the coast near the lighthouse (33.83)

Warriors:
Head North along the coast after taking out Oracles and you will encounter the Warriors. (36.22)

Coastrunners:
After Warriors keep going North and you will finally find the Coastrunners. (54.10) | Subject: "Go North!"
When you get the quest, the Oracles and the Tidehunters are nearby. The other two (Coast Runner & Warrior) are a little more elusive.

Go North up the coast and you will eventually run into the Warriors. (level 14-15) Kill 7, and keep going!  All the way up towards the North-most part of the coast you'll finally find the Coast Runners.  They're level 11-12.

Why do they send someone on a level 19 quest to kill level 11's?  I don't know... But it's worth about 1450exp at level 19. | Subject: "Lots of running."
Once you get this quest, head up North to the very top of the coast, North of the pumpkin farm.  Coastrunners are up there.

Then just work your way down the beach; you'll run into Warriors, then Oracles, & finally Tidehunters.

And then you can turn in at the Lighthouse. | The Horde can do this quest
