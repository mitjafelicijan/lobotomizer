Hes at 71, 80 in a small House. If you attack him, he and 1 Mage (Fire) and a melee unit will attack you. So watch up. Did this Quest @ lvl 11 qith the help of a 9 Hunter. Not easy @ lvl 11 but doable. | Morgan the Collector is the mob you are looking for. He is located at the Brackwell Pumpkin Patch at 71,80. There are several mobs around him so the quest can be slightly difficult if soloing. | The prereq for this quest is The Collector, https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=123
