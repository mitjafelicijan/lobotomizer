# Subject: "you and your nonsense decimals"
standard world of warcraft doesn't operate in decimal coordinates, yes i agree that they'd be more accurate, but for the majority, myself included, the regular coordinates (79,55) work great for most of us, and yes, i did in fact complete calculus 2 by my senior year of highschool | 79, 55 - Rolf's corpse | Subject: "Discover Rolf's Fate"
Actually Rolf's remains (which look like a bunch of flesh with ribs sticking out from the fleshy mass) is located at the northern most end of the first Murloc village on the eastern shore (or at least that is where I found it). | Subject: "79,55"
79,55 is correct, fairly easy, just dont aggro too many | Upon picking up the corpse, you'll get the quest description above. If you look northeast past the river and rocks, you can see some murlocs. If you head in that direction you will come to a lot of Murloc Huts. The body is in that direction right in the middle of the intersection between two huts. I recommend you bring a friend for this one, it's tough at level 8 or 9.
