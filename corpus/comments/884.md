# Subject: "No permanent bonus"
Tested these quests out today. The spirit bonus is +2 in all cases but it disappears when you die. I was 77, went up to 79, died, was 77 again. Sorry folks, this is not a permanent spirit bonus. | Subject: "Help for quest and What do u get after quest is done :)"
After you get the quest ''Owatanka'', You have to go or take a flight to ''Camp taurajo'' then you have to a Some one Called ''Jorn Skyseer'' standing close the Big Place with the tailroing experts and skinning experts.Finsh of the quest then u will get +2 Spirit.Ty for reading have fun playing WOW | After turning this in, I noticed the spell/level up animation Jorn cast on me, but could find no buffs. So, I went back and did this again on a different character and wrote down all of my stats beforehand. It seems that completion of this quest gives you a permanent boost of +2 to your spirit. I am now trying to track down the other two similar mobs to see if they do the same thing. | Subject: "Owatanka Means..."
Interestingly enough, 'Stonefur' in Taurahe comes out as Owatanka. But other things come out as the same word.. such as Barkskin and Blackpaw (Shtumani).

Like a Kodo, Owatanka wanders his own little path, but he is most easily found by traveling southeast of Taurajo, near the mountains to the east of the road.
