Fly to Ironforge, ask one of the guards where the Deeprun Tram is, and take it to Stormwind. This is the only way to get to Stormwind from Loch Moden, without going all the way around into zones you shouldn't be getting into yet. | Subject: "<Blank>"
Furen Longbeard is at 57,16 in Stormwind. Pretty much in the center of the Dwarven District, right next to the Journeyman Blacksmith. This quest ends with him.
