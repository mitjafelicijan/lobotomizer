# Before accepting this quest or Magram Alliance (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1367) it is a good idea to check the rewards for the final quest in the series since you can only complete one series without taking a lot of effort faction grinding after finishing one series.

The rewards for the Gelkis Alliance series are:
-Gelkis Marauder Chain (mail chest: 14 agi, 7 str https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6773)
-Uthek's Finger (off-hand: 5 stam, 5 int, 5 spi https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6774)

The rewards for the Magram Alliance series are:
-Magram Hunter's Belt (leather belt: 8 agi, 9 stam https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6788)
-Ceremonial Centaur Blanket (cloak: 2 int, 9 spi https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6789) | Fun facts:
Each kill gives you 20 reputation, while taking 100 reputation from the opposing faction.
Therefore, it will take you 50 kills in order to become Friendly with the prescribed faction. | The Magram Villiage is located around 73,73

The Gelkis Villiage is 37, 86 | Subject: "Magram Village"
Location of Magram Village is around 73,74 | Subject: "coords for uthek the wise"
he can be found at the very southwest of desolace at the gelkis camp

36,79 | Subject: "Long but easy"
Every Magram I killed was worth 20 rep with the other clan.  You can watch your rep by going to character info/reputation and watching the points add up.  Took me 80 kills to get from 1400 to 3000, and it didn't matter what centaurs I killed.

They are based around 65,80

Funny thing is, they just let you walk up to them and start smacking away.  Even when your rep goes to unfriendly, it's hard to aggro.

BTW, since you have to kill about 40 magram, get "Centaur Bounty" befor you start. Might as well be collecting centaur ears as you go along. | If you are too high level you get only 4 rep instead of 20, could take some time to begin the quest chain then... | Subject: "Exactly what to do"
You need to go to 73,73 on the desolace map.

Kill all the enemies, you get -20 per enemy then and you need  -1000 reputation so you need to kill 50 of them.

I was lvl 35 got 650 xp.

turn it in at 35,78 | I read through the advice given for both chains, and considered the gear rewards, but to be honest, what is most important is the XP, right? Naturally, the Alliance scum get more in the chain (typical Blizzard) than the awesome Horde with the faction introduction quests.

(Alliance)
Brutal Politics - 2,050xp
Assault - 2,550xp
or
Strange Alliance - 2,050xp
Raid on the Kolkar - 2,550xp

(Horde)
Gelkis Alliance - 660xp
or
Magram Alliance - 660xp

(Both)

Gelkis Questline
Stealing Supplies - 1,350xp
Ongeku - 2,850xp
Khan Jehn - 2,850xp
Khan Hratha - 4,300xp and this or this

Total = 12,010xp

Magram Questline
Broken Tears - 2,650xp
Gizmo for Warug - 2,050xp
Kahn Shaka - 2,850xp
Khan Hratha - 4,300xp and this or this

Total = 12, 510xp - but costs the price of one Advanced Target Dummy server dependant (1gold 30silver on my server - not worth 500xp)

Basically, Alliance scum get more XP than Hord regardless of the chain you pick, or if you're crazy and grind back rep to do both chains. Magram rewards an extra 500xp, but you'll need to pay out some cash for it, so factor this into your choice. The gear rewards are pretty meh, and it's likely you have better - but if you somehow have worse, it might be worth it to you.
