# You should look for a small dirt at 49, 78 - Duskwood.
It's not the SOUTH farm from Sven (even though the quest says so). It's south east, Yorgen Farmstead. | Subject: "Svan's revenge"
my guess is that those who can not find the loose dirt are at the wrong farm.Â  I spent a whole lot of time at the Addler Stead in the far south west, but the quest is actually in the Yorgen Farmstead in the middle of the area | Subject: "Location"
Travel to the back of the Yorgen Farmstead, which is opposite the Twilight Grove and Vul'Gol Ogre Mound at the fork in the road. Keep an eye out for Defias rogues lurking in the fields. Between the two buildings, behind the big tree stump, there is a mound of dirt. This is where the book is, return to Sven with the book. | This also begins a very long series that ends up having you kill Morbent Fel. This series alone can level you and get some good Loot along the way. | Subject: "Easy way to solve this quest"
People keep on asking for grps for this quest while it isnt really needed, the grave is between the 2 houses, and u can sneak in from behind without any major problems, u might need to kill 1 humanoid | Subject: "TLOC"
the correct coords are 50,75!
