if you don't have coordinates...in the middle/left top part of the map, near the twin colossal. | if u dont have cords, its at the O in the twin cOlossals | Subject: "Where to find him"
45, 25

Or if you don't have Cosmos just at the letter 'T' in 'The' of the title of 'The Twin Colossus' at the NE of Feralas.

Good luck. | Subject: "Bloodpetal required"
Warning for the people who like to clean up their bags just like i do: make sure you don't throw away your bloodpetal.

I was so stupid to throw it away and I travelled to feralas for nothing:p gregan requires it in order to finish the quest. (i know they say it in the quest but everyone makes mistakes). | Subject: "if you started the Linken Chain...."
go to Winterspring first, then you'll have 2 quests to take to Gregan | Subject: "Exact Location"
It's in the Twin Colossals of Feralas.
