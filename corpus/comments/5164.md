Get the quest that starts the chain in UBRS from Awbee.

Go to Winterspring and either make the double jump(which I am pretty sure got fixed in a recent patch) or you can suicide through the cave and stand on the rune.  If you are unsure where the rune is, die at the end of the cave where Scryer is and look in the room till you see a small blue circle.  All you have to do is stand on the rune for less than a second and you will get teleported.  Also, make sure you strip if you can before you do this because since the dragons stun, it takes a few deaths.

After you talk to Haleh and accept the quest and all that good jazz, you will get teleported to the lake in WPL.  Get out of the lake and run around to the west side of Andorhal and there is a big farm house thing.  Kill several of the mobs in there so you can get to the room on the top story.  Talk to the elf in there and complete his quest and he will tell you to go look at the book.  Look at it and accept.  Look once more and you should be able to accept the quest for the epic gear.

Also, I'm pretty sure you can find the Blood of Heroes in EPL, the Chromatic stuff should be in UBRS, and the Skin is in Scholo. | follow-ups:
