# Take note that you MUST be hated with Booty Bay in order to get this quest. There is a bug/exploit you can do to get to Friendly with Bloodsail and still be friendly with Booty Bay, but you will be unable to get this quest.

Dont waste your time on the exploit. But get this hat, its very worth it for the novelty! Dont be afraid of goblin rep. You can reobtain that within hours with just about 200 gold by buying cloth and turning it in (or farm instances for it)

YARR MATEYS! | You can get this quest as low as level 55. I started trying to get this quest since I was level 41 and since checked back at "Pretty Boy" Duncan to see if I could get this quest.

You can farm Bloodsail rep at Faldir's Cove in Arathi Highlands if you want to finish this rep gain as early as lv 40. I started farming Bloodsail rep in Faldir's Cove at level 37.
