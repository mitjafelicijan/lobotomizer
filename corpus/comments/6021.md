hes at the 27 ,86 | You can find Zaeldarr in a cemetary in Ravencroft. Once you enter the mausoleum, there will be a few mobs on the way down, which are easy to dispatch. Zaeldarr will be there with two other mobs. With a bit of crowd control, it shouldn't be too difficult to solo. | Subject: "Another Quest"
If you are at least level 54, you should also pick up another quest that starts in the underground tomb where Zaeldarr is. Click on the scroll and accept the quest to kill Infiltrator Hameya in Zul'Mashar (NNE portion of map; east of the NE Ranger Lodge). Reward is for both a cool sword and an okay cape.
