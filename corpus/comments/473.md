It appears that you cannot get this quest until you complete "The Algaz Gauntlet" mission given by Mountaineer Rockgar in Loch Modan. | If you have completed The Algaz Gauntlet but you still can't see the quest from Valstag Ironjaw, drop the quest "War Banners".

It appears as though if you've already talked to Captain Stoutfist and picked up the quest from him, you won't see the quest to report to him. | Subject: "<Blank>"
Here's the way to find him:

First, go into the keep. Pick a wing, left or right, and then go straight until you run into a room that has cots, like barracks. Next, turn either left or right to enter a room in the middle of both paths. There should be stairs and the NPC with quest "Fiona Longears". Go up these stairs, and turn right. Turn left up the ramp, and a left again to find the room he's in.
