Ok, this Craftsman's Writ takes 160 runecloth, 16 Ironweb Spider Silk, 32 Rugged Leather, and 8 Rune Thread.

just to explain the math:

8 Runecloth Boots X 4 bolt of runecloth per boot X 5 runecloth per bolt = 160

8 Runecloth Boots X 2 Ironweb Spider Silk per boot = 16

8 Runecloth Boots X 4 Rugged Leather per boot = 32

(and just to be thorough)

8 Runecloth Boots X 1 Rune Thread per boot= 8

so, in short, you need:
160 runecloth
16  Ironweb Spider Silk
32  Rugged Leather
8  Rune Thread
