Repeatable the quest may be

However, if you're seeking to get multiple of one particular item it will not allow you to claim the reward, such as if you want to get 4 18 slot bags, then after you have claimed your first one it will say "Revered Amoungst the Dawn failed:  Duplicate item found"

Tried leaving my item in the bank and heading back however failed still - permently printed. 

Just want to save you all the trouble if any are looking to recieve multiple of the same items from this quest. | Subject: "YEs"
