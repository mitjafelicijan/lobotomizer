Confirmed at 45,20.

Had to kill about 27 gnolls before she spawned. She's a level 14. Easy solo for a well-geared 13 warlock, tho' you should expect to spend a bit of time here. | Subject: "45.20 confirmed."
45.20 in Silverpine Forest confirmed.

I think this all comes down to your luck in timing.  I arrived and she was already in the middle of the field.  Killed a few mobs and then her and then I was off with her essence.  I didn't have to wait so I wouldn't know how long it takes for her to appear.  Apparently I got lucky.  So if you arrive and she is not in the middle of the field....you can either:

a) cross your fingers and pray that she arrives shortly 

b) you can /dance while you wait

c) you can begin crying that your luck is horrible and life sucks

d) You can do some grinding in the area and make the best of it.  This place is EXCELLENT for grinding and if you are a tailor...lots of linen!

It is all up to you!
