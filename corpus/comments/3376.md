Hi. My name's Kaydaa, and I usually play Alliance on Argent Dawn, but decided to make a Tauren for fun.
In the following, I will describe in detail how to find Sharptusk and other helpful hints. Good luck! :)

Alright. So you've gotten the quest? Now, here's what you do:
1. Head to the Brambleblade Ravine, which, on your map, is in the lower right-hand corner. Find the cave-like enterance, which leads to a clearing with pigs and humanoids. The camp is marked with large, green thorns.
2. You'll see that there's a wall directly opposite you when you walk into the clearing of the Ravine. Killing the enemies along the way, go straight to the wall opposite you.
3. Follow this wall to the first clearing you can go between. Turn to face the opening in the canyon.
4. There will be three paths to choose from here: straight, left and right . Choose straight .
5. After turning a corner, you will see another fork.. this time for right and left . Choose right .
6. Now you should see a clearing with many Quilboar, and on a little hill in front of you, a large tent.
7. Clear the Quilboar outside the tent, then proceed inside to kill Sharptusk for your reward!

Now, that wasn't so bad, was it? Okay, time for a few "Extra Tips"...

1. When you get to step 6 and see the final clearing and Sharptusk's tent, there's a path going right up to a cave. It's not an exit, as I thought, but if you clear all the people inside, there's a map on the cave's floor that begins a quest.
2. The large green thorns can be climbed on for quick mana/health breaks.. however, I wouldn't suggest AFKing here, because enemies can climb them too.

Good luck and happy holidays,
Kaydaa and the Boanbimo Goonies :). | Coords: (64.77)

Or else follow ewarlocks advice. I'm sure it's correct. (I entered at a different place and pretty much just ran about the place). | Welcome, young Tauren, to the first step in the vast plains of Mulgore and Azeroth beyond! I've paused to just post a small list of quests you should be sure to pick up before venturing into the Brambleblade Ravine area...

- Rite of Strength: Collect the belts off of the Quillboars inside the ravine. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=757)

- The Battleboars: Kill these piggies in the clearing in front of the ravine for their meat and snouts. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=780)

** Attack on Camp Narache: For an extra quest, head up the path going right [near Sharptusk's tent]. Kill the boars inside and click on the map on the cave floor to begin the quest. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=781)

* Shaman: The Quillboar shaman within provide the salve you need for your Call of Earth quest. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1519)

My post is quite vague, but it's merely a set of guidelines. Feel free to act as you wish. After all, I am not you, you are you! Have fun, and may you have the Earthmother's blessing. | Subject: "Coords"
