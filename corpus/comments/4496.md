Yes, well apparently I'm the one paying for your fast loots - killed about 100 of those damn beasts and no glands yet... If I have to kill 100 more I think I'm gonna produce glands myself :( | Leads to https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4507 | Subject: "You in the right area?"
Its the insects in Un'Goro

Not Tanaris | Un'Goro soil can be found on various mobs in Un'Goro. They can also found within Un'Goro dirt piles. The dirt piles generally yeild multiple samples of soil. | Killed about 35-45 various different bug types to finally get my Gorishi Scent Gland.

I got mine from a Worker. Don't know if the others drop or not. But if its not dropping, keep killing. Might take a while. | Subject: "tloc 55,76 First kill ^ ^"
