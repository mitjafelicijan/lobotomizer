The quest is inside the far-left cave (Shadow hold).
Location: X:35 Y:58 -or- Jaedenar, West of the road, just before the river seperating the zone.

The flames are purple and inside a large bowl or Brazier.

1. Pain (when entering the first main room, the flame is right beside the wall. Basiclly, if you jump straight into the room and don't go down the path, It'll be behind you.)

2. Hatred (After dousing the Pain flame, its on the up on the path leading deeper into the cave.)

3. Suffering (when entering the room with candles, follow the path downwards into that room, follow the path through the room)

4. Malice (turn to the right of Suffering flame near the other wall)

Pain: 36,56
Hatred: 37,55

It is in the big cave, the exact coordinates are:
Pain: 36,56
Hatred: 37,55
Suffering: 37,53
Malice: 38,53

Suggest at least 2 try a group of 3 easier.

They are bowls on the floor with a white flame in them.

And to all above who cares how you did it provide some information ya pack of little girls | Upon entering the cave, you'll hopefully get a drop that starts the quest A Strange Red Key (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5202), which leads to the escort quest Rescue from Jaedenar (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5203). The path taken by the escort quest hits all of the flames, so you can do the two quests concurrently. The Night Elf you're escorting will also help you by offtanking enemies along the route. With her help, I soloed this quest quickly and easily as a 56 warrior. | Subject: "Quest"
Shadow Hold is western cave on map. 35,58.
First brazier in room with Captured Arko'n in cage.
  Guard on left drops red key. Use on cage to start
  quest: Rescue from Jaedenar. Arko'n will look for
        her stuff. She agros everything around.               
        Don't start unless you are prepared to kill
        3-4 Lvl 53-55s.
For second braizier take ramp on the left in room
  before a circular walkway. 
Third and fourth are at the end of the passage
  leading from the circular walkway. | Follow-up is A Final Blow (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5242). | Killing the first two or three level 53s on the way in was easy. Getting into the room with the cage and trying to pull the 55 demon was less so. He brought with him the 54 warlock, two 53 guards, the Notre Dame Marching Band and the entire population of Racine, Wisconsin, all of whom had some version of stun. I guess there was a convention in town. My 54 Feral lasted about 27 nanoseconds in that inferno. There were so many creatures on the screen, some of them fell out onto my desk. I must have been in the wrong cave since everybody else seemed to have such as easy time. So proceed with caution and hope you run into the B team or maybe bring a friend?
