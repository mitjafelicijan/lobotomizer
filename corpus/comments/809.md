32,44 confirmed for Durator map
62,20 confirmed for Barrens map | Subject: "Location"
yeh this quest gained me an easy 460 xp and the location of 62,20 is right | Easy quest, just run west from Razor Hill until you see a bridge. Cross the bridge and turn left. Ak'Zeloth is under the watch tower next to some stones on a table. | Subject: "remember where you got the quest"
look in your quest log and you will see that it's under "durotar". so it's west of durotar not the barrens. I know it was a bit confusing so i hope this helps for those of you without and map mod.
