Where is it: Arathi Highlands (SE of TM - follow the road)
Cosmos Level: 32
Creep Level : Ogres are 32-33, Enforcers are 33-34
Located at : Ogres are anywhere from 31, 48 to 35, 44, which is North (and a little East) of Stromguard. Enforcers are inside the cave at 35, 44

Creep XP : About 230 (for a level 32 mage, with normal rest)
Quest Completion : 2550 XP, and 30 silver.
Creep Drops : About 1 silver, and 30 copper per ogre. Good farming for tailors, since I had a pretty constant drop of silk and wool

Tips : - When they become enraged, they double their damage (from about 45 per hit, to about 100 per hit), but become much slower. Even a few steps back will buy you a few seconds more.
- I noticed that they had a fairly decent aggro range, so its best if you cleared the area instead of sneaking by them.
- Ogres are based along the road, and just North of Strom. The road is used often by both horde and alliance, but I noticed more alliance than horde. Some folks also wait for their group on the road outside Strom, so you might
get picked off if you're on a pvp server . Its best to try and stay infront of the cave.

- Really good area for Herbologists. Noticed an assortment of plants =)

Finish:
Cash it at Hammerfall with a guy called 'Drum Fel' on the upperdeck, near the inn, at 74, 33
Time:
Took me about 40 minutes as a 32 mage, but I died twice, and did some pvp fighting.

Enjoy =)!

btw location is 34,44 | Subject: "<Blank>"
WHO:  31 shadow spec ud priest
WHERE: 36,43  Boulderfist Outpost

NOTE:  Remember: as a priest DISTANCE is your friend.  Start clearing outside the mine entrance.  The ogres (need 8) are all roaming around the outside.  The enforcers (need 10) are all inside the mine.  Most of the enforcers are 34 but u can find some 33 inside or as respawns.
As a low level the trick is to get the enforcers one at a time.  You clear the outside (2-3 ogres sitting around) so that you can hit one of the enforcers and drag him out a bit so you don't have to worry about any addons.  Basically you take care of the ogre requirements and provide a safe area to clear out enforcers.

An awesome strategy that I found was that when the ogres or enforcers become enraged (their fists will start glowing red) is to run back a bit and start attacking from far away again.  When the ogres/enforcers become enraged their walking speed is reduced to about 50% it seems.  This makes it ridiculously ez to kill them as long as you don't get any adds.  Also you get minimal damage should be unable to shield. | Subject: "Mobs"
The ogres are outside the mine.

The enforcers are INSIDE the mine.

Be carefull cause they pop REALLY fast
