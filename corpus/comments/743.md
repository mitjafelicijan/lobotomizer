Couple people mention you can find these just South of road before entering The Barrens. Coords roughly 63, 69 if you have mod. Otherwise you will see what looks like giant pine cones hanging from trees on your right as you are walking down the road right before getting to Barrens. That's their nests. Harpies are female looking birds. You will see Turquoise and White ones. The drop rate is about 1 in 2 or 3. It shouldn't take you much more than about 10-15 mins working solo. Their levels are 7-8. | 63,70 along that ridge there.
