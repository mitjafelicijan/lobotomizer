It's about 42,40, not 42,20.Â  Be sure to double check before you give incorrect information. | For the "exploring" portion of this quest, I completed inside the southern rim of the southernmost crater seen on the overhead map of felwood -- roughly half a cm above the two letter o's in Bloodvenom Falls on the map.

For those who use coord's -- 41,42 | Note that although this quest is marked "Elite", it is quite doable without killing any of the elites that roam in Shatter Scar Vale.

The quest mobs are non-elite. | Subject: "dood"
Defenitly not elite. You don't actually have to kill any of the elites and it is easy to avoid them. Easy quest nice xp. | Subject: "Quest Location"
41, 41 You'll find everything right there. | Subject: "Not really wrong!"
There are five craters not one (41-43,42-41,45-40,42-38,40-40)so dont accuse anyone if u are not sure for existance of a second solution's:) tnx for reading my message
