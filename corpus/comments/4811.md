# The red crystal is due east of Auberdine, along the eastern mountain border at 47,48. You may see a large number of Raging Moonkin near it. | Subject: "Red Crystal"
If you use the in-game map, this crystal is up on a hill that is due east of the lower leg of the letter "E" in Auberdine.

Approach from the north side so you can get up the hill. | Subject: "the red crystal"

It's due east of Auberdine.  All the way to the mountains.  And just a smige south. | Subject: "A simple Macro to find out your position on the map"
To find out my position on the map I use this simple macro:

/script local posX,posY=GetPlayerMapPosition("player");
/script posX=posX*100;posY=posY*100;
/script message("x="..posX.." y="..posY);

or

/script local posX,posY=GetPlayerMapPosition("player");
/script posX=posX*100;posY=posY*100;
/script SendChatMessage("x="..posX.." y="..posY);
