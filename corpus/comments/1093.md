# These drop off of the Venture Co. Operators spread out in Windshear Crag. The highest concentration lie on the broken down super reaper just inside the crag. Walk on it and there are about 4-5 operators spawned there. May take a few clears of it to get the plans or you may get lucky on the first couple kills. Enjoy! | Subject: "<Blank>"

I was out doing Gnome's Respite at the same time and killed lots of Operators (among other things :P), but no drop until I had completed Gnome's Respite. The very next Operator I KO'd dropped it for me, near the mine in the East of the area. | Stonetalon Mountains: 62.53 (Broken down Super Reaper) | Subject: "<Blank>"
The race of the operator is random.Â  You have to kill 20-30 of them before you get one to drop...just be patient and stay near the machine and kill any that have "Operator" in the name... | You dont have to do the first part from ratchet in order to get this quest | Subject: "Loc ..."
