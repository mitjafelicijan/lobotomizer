They are at 47,47. | Subject: "Nekrosh"
This is a difficult quest to solo.  The catapult (from the road head into the camp; bear left and it is halfway up the hill on the right)is surrounded by a large number of mobs and pulling them singly is difficult to say the least.  Once you have achieved this simply move in and you will see the active cog (assuming you still have the dwarven timber).  Clicking on this will start the fire.  At this point you get the next quest to kill Nekrosh himself.  For this I am certainly going to need some assistance.
