# Quest ID: 1076
# Quest Title: Devils in Westfall
# Quest URL: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1076
# Subject: "Random Drop"
I accepted this quest and flew from Stormwind to Westfall. About 10 seconds before landing, I passed over a dust devil and marked its location.

Ran like hades for where I'd seen him, summoned my pet (playing a hunter), killed him, got the drop off the first one I saw.

It's all about luck, I guess.

Other things to note:

The Dust Devil managed to cast Gust of Wind before I killed it.  I double-checked, and it is confirmed by the "Raptor is afflicted by Gust of Wind" message in my combat log. 

Also, to answer a question above, this is the second branch of the "A Gnome's Respite" quest.  When you complete "A Gnome's Respite", you get "An Old Colleague" and "A Scroll for Mauren", which is this quest. 

As soon as you complete both those quests and turn in the items, you get "Covert Ops - Alpha" and "Covert Ops - Beta" quests.

Hope this helps. | Subject: "found one just like you said"
