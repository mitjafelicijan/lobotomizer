Noboru is the mon that drops the club/mace... right click on it for the quest (try to equip it basically)...

He wanders randomly in the swamp but his main base is the small island just north of Horde Stonard... the tent is smoking that may be what appears to be a campfire...

(it is the same island tent that you have to go to get the box from the escort quest of th ehuman that was in a cage in the refuge)

You take the mace, after you right-click it to launch the quest, to the stationary NPC named Matgoor in the nw corner os SoS... as soon as you come in the zone from Red Ridge area head north into 26,31 coords (i think its called Misty Valley)... then you give it to him and it triggers second part of quest to get crystals from the lost ones...

Crystals are not dropped - they are huge and are in the refuge village area... you can't miss them, this is a good time to get the escort quest... then you return the (6?) crystals to complete at the same time you are escorting the human out of the swamp since it is the same direction and his escort quest completes before the Matgoor camp...

Note: good time to do the "...Bugs" quest... you go straight through the lost ones camp at the Refuge and to the coast... kill the crabs Silt ones and Huge ones all drop the legs you need. | Subject: "Only once"
Though you can kill Noboru more than once (and probably will as you wander the area), the cudgel will only drop once. Incidentally to "activate" the quest, you need to right click on the cudgel once it's in your inventory. This will bind it to you and allow you to turn in the quest.
