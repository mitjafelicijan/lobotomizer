# Subject: "Read this if tou can't get the quest!"
This quest can only be done by tauren because they usualy enter The Barrens from the Mulgore side. But since other races enter from the Durotar side, there is no need for this q. Therefor, forget this q exists, and go straight for the next,

Called: The Forgotten Pools

You can get it from Tonga Runetotem, at cords: 52.31.

And that should do the trick :) good luck! | If you already have the quest "The Forgotten pool" that yuo get from the NPC in the Crossroads, you can no longer pick this quest. Don't worry and move on :)
