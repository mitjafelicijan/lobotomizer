# Subject: "Crown of the Earth Series"
The "Crown of the Earth" quest series is rather tricky to get started.  You can't pick it up in the middle, apparently, but must start in the Dark Elf newbie zone of Aldrassil.

First talk to Gilshalan Windwalker in Aldrassil at tloc 58,42.  Right-click on him even if he does not have a quest icon above his head.  You need to do his two quests:
Webwood Venom
Webwood Egg
After completing "Webwood Egg", Right-click on him again (even if he does not have a quest icon above his head).  This time he gives you:
Tenaron's Summons
Go up the ramp next to Gilshalan all the way to the top room and talk to Tenaron Stormgrip who will give you the first "Crown of Earth" quest.
Crown of the Earth
You are now hooked up and completing each quest will automatically get you the next one in the series. | Prereq: Webwood Egg
