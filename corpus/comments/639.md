# Enter at: 26,56 and just hope it drops fast.. It took at least 40 kills for this to drop. | Subject: "My mistake"
Don't make the mistake I did... I was killing anything I could find including the Defenders.  This thing drops only off of Syndicates so make sure you stick to them.  Once I started doing that, the drop rate went up haha.  I got it after probably 20 kills.  Not horrid. | Subject: "<Blank>"
Just go to Stromgarde in SW corner of Arathi. Tloc 26,56
