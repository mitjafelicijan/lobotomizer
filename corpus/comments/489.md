I had trouble finding them at first. I found one and waited there, but it didnt respawn. Then I found one at 59,56 that did respawn really quick.  For those w/out coords its on the opposite side of the tree thats by the guy.

So I think that if the one you find doesn't respawn in 1 min, you should find another. Hope this helps. | Subject: "fel Cone found"
found at 58,55  and 59,56  they respawn quickly | Subject: "Seek Redemptin"
The Fel Cone is exactly at 59,56. It respawns within 20-30sec. And yes, when taking it to Zenn, he turns into a "ribbit". But the quest is done then. | You can find the Fel Cones around Zenn Foulhoof or even further around Starbreeze Village. Try to look around the bases of very large trees. Some coordinates to try are 58, 55 and 59, 56. | Subject: "Shouldn't be too hard..."
They are very hard to identity, but they are pretty easy to find. A few locations:
62, 66 - in the back
59, 61
59, 62
56, 66 - on the east side

I highly (HIGHLY) recommend doing this along with the timberling quests (Timberling Seeds and Timberling Sprouts). You will already be in this general area.
