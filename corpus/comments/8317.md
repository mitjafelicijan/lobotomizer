There is a trade goods vendor in front of the building near the horde FP. You can buy the spices there. You can cook at any of the flaming braziers located in the area. | Subject: "Re: Kitchen Assistance [8317]"
Have to have cooking of 285 to get this quest. | on my AH right now, 1 dumpling is 1g 9s buyout

ten Soothing spices are also 14s. So you just get 1.56g for this quest whereas you can easily make 10g from selling these.

3000 exp is very little as well. screw this quest, no followup, not worth it. | Subject: "Recipe is in your Cooking book"
Once you share the recipe with the quest lady, it will be in your cooking book.
