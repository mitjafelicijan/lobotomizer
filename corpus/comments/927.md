The quest doesn't start with Shalomon, like the description above states.  It starts when you kill Blackmoss the Fetid and loot the Moss-twined Heart off his body.  The heart starts the quest when you right-click it in your inventory.  It requires level 5 to begin the quest.  I just found Blackmoss at 44,30.
