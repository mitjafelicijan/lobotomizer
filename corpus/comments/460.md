67,24 | Drops from Rot Hide Gnolls, got mine while working on this quest: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=443

Grave is located at 67,24 just east of the keep in front of the stables. It's marked as shallow grave and has boots sticking out of it. | Subject: "Add'l info..."
There's a rare spawn 22 elite gnoll on the castle grounds. I've only seen him once.

If you want another way in (maybe a little easier), there's an opening in the wall at the back of the castle. There are a couple of vile fins, then you're able to sneak in the back of the castle.

The grave is inside the castle keep. If you enter through the main entrance, bear right, between the keep and the inn-like building, and bear right and you should see the grave back there. I think the grave has boots sticking out of it.

Good luck. | Subject: "Re: Resting in Pieces [460]"
I don't have the chords but it's quite easy. Just swim to the Fenris Isle and walk into the big castle. Kill one by one, or run through it if you prefer to die ^^ Follow the eastern wall and you will get to 3 small houses. To the east of them, you'll see this grave:
