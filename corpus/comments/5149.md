Also, looting a doll part gives a percent chance of spawning a mob to attack you. I do not remember the name, but I do remember them being hard-hitters. | Subject: "<Blank>"
You need to find 3 parts. They can be found in the 2 houses near Pamela.

heh! I was working too hard to get the parts expecting the damn quest to say complete when I did. Turns out that I need to assemble the doll. Right click on one of the three parts and then you have a doll! | Subject: "Doll parts loc"

2. Left side 40,90 on the other side of building outside.
3. Head 40,90 next to the chimminy on the left side as u face it from the back of the house outside.

Don't walk infront of the door or the ghost will come out! | Subject: "Pam's Doll"
For heaven's sakes we know by now that there are 3 pieces to the darn doll, that they spawn in different places and that they bring up one to several lvl 55 specters..but once you have the three parts.. what do you do? you click on them to make the whole doll..had to figure it out on my own..
Oh all right so it's not rocket science but still, someone couldve mentioned it :)
And another thing: this is a very depressing quest: that poor little girl all by herself ugh..it broke my heart..really it's creepy.. | Subject: "More Quests"
After completing this quest you can then get the quests Auntie Marlene and Uncle Carlin.
