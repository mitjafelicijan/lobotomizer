# If like me, you have spent a long time trying to track the mob that carries the scroll (Aean Swiftriver) and her party, but haven't been able to find them, then make sure you check Lushwater Oasis, just south of Wailing Caverns. For some reason, they stop for an undetermined period of time at a centaur tent south of the oasis (47.3, 41.8).
I found them standing there, after looking for them a long time...

I had no idea allies were friends with the centaurs of the Barrens! :P
