to get this choose the felhound for your apprentice quest.  the infernal gets you one with the same stats, only fire damage.  orb or staff, its your choice...locks just do alot more shadow damage. | These two items are of the same ilvl - meaning the two items are equilavent in terms of total points. The orb is blue because it is an offhand. You should always take the orb. Even if you find a lame main hand sword or dagger, that plus the orb is better than the staff since that the orb alone is already the equilavent of the staff. If you pick the staff, you do not get to wield another main hand. | Subject: "Hypnotic Blade"
Hypnotic Blades new stats;
+8 int
+3 spi
+9 dmg and healing.

Better to go with the orb..
