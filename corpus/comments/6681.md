5.) Start from the Bat Handler and head east to the river. Once at the river you'll see land on the other side.
6.) Cross the river and get to the other side.
<Be careful for there are aggresive bears and spiers.>
7.) Once on the other side you should see a HUGE tree with a mountain behind it and two paths to go around it (Take whichever path you wish for it is not important). Though I perfer the right path around the mountain.
8.) Once your behind the mountain look up for there you'll see a zig-zag pathway up the mountain.
9.) Head up the mountain and follow the dirt road.
10.) Once your at the top you'll see level 50 Neutral Guards and behind them you see the tunnel!
11.) No need to stealth past the Guards for they wont attack you at all.
12.) Turn on 'Detect Traps'
13.) Enter the tunnel.
14.) Upon entering the tunnel you should see the chest! Hovering above the chest you should see a blue rectangle.
15.) Head towards the chest, but DO NOT OPEN IT! Once your close enough the quest update should have activated.
16.) Keep going through the tunnel and you end at the Manor.
17.) Head to the building and talk with Fahrad - BOOM quest completed!!

I posted this step by step while doing it with my level 24 Undead Rogue and boy was it a piece of cake! As said already you get to do the pick-pocketing to gain reputation with Ravenholdt, but thats just simple :).

Hope this helped and good luck and have fun!

Okay, since noone has given exact step by step directions on getting this quest and finishing it, then I will.

<Skulli> Undead Rogue
Proudmoore Realm | In case anyone is still having trouble locating the road to Ravenholdt its 75,24. Directly behind the plateau thats north of Durnholde Keep. | HC'ers, no need to bother with this quest. Doesn't give anything except for the Ravenholdt rep. | Subject: "Ravenholdt Quest Line"
Ravenholdt is located in the Hillsbrad Hill, in the north part of the map. It is nort of Dunholde. Do not get dicouraged if you can't find the path immediately, as it's somewhat obscured by trees ad hills. When you do find it, you will come to a cave with a single chest in it.

DO NOT OPEN THE CHEST

Use your detect traps spell before open the chest, and a blue rectangle will appear over the chest. All that is needed to complete this part is to have that blue diamond visible and walk really close to the chest. This will allow you to do the second section of this quest line. Follow the path through the cave to the second floor of the Ravenholdt manor.

The second part involves pickpocketing Syndicate Emblems from syndicate members. The best place to do this is the ruined watch tower by the road to Dunholde. You will not get any emblems from killing syndicate members, only for pickpocketing them. When you have about 30 of these (fewer if you're human I beleive) you raise for faction rating with this area. Note this is not a lggable quest, as each of the guards in the ravenholdt area will not let you accept the quest until you have brought them some emblems. You may do this part as many times as you like to raise your faction rating.

I have no idea what this accomplishes, except for finishing your Rogue class quest. Which is always good, neh? | Subject: "loc of tunnel"
The loc of the path that leads up to the tunnel is 75,23 | Ravenholt Manor is located east-southeast of Tarren Mill.
You will have to go up the side of the mountain till you find a pathway leading further up the mountain.
At the top of the pathway you will find a cave.
You must go through the cave, however if you are a rogue seeking their ravenholt quest, as you pass by remeber to watch out for the chest within the cave as it is a part of that quest.
Once you are through the cave you will enter a grove with a path, follow the path and you will arrive at Ravenholt Manor.

As a note the Ravenholt quests are not completed, so keep that in mind should you attempt them you will eventunally hit a quest with no way to finish it. Just a friendly warning. | Make sure you have the skill Detect Traps. You can still see the trap without the skill, but your quest will not be completed when you walk past the chest.

If needed you can buy the skill from Fahrad inside Ravenholdt Manor. | Subject: "April 15 2005 Update"
Got this Quest at 24
went to Hillsbrad Foothills
Found the chest
Used detect traps
Walked around the chest til the Quest updated
Spoke with Fahrad
Spoke with the Gaurds
Pick-pocketed 30 emblems off of the Syndicate mobs in Durnholde Keep
Went back to the gaurds
Turned the emblems in (one at a time as opposed to all at once.. very annoying)(and the gaurds only accepted 27 of the emblems before the "!" stopped appearing above their heads...
I then spoke with everyone in the manor, their reactions to my presence had changed from when I first went in. (instead of calling me "worm" they now use my Name.)
The Gaurd to Fahrad's Right says to speak with "Winstone Wolf" (Who is downstairs at  the table)
Winstone does not have any interaction.....

Contacting GM for update on Content, will post here if and when I hear anything.

You get the Rite of Cunning for just detecting the trap on the box in the tunnel.  Try to open it if you want to fight the lvl 33 Elite that spawns by trying =)

Once you turn this in to the Master Rogue inside Ravenholdt, he tells you to talk to the guards.  The guards want you to pick pocket Sydicate Emblems from the nearby keep.  Each one of these you turn in to them raises your faction with Ravenholdt by a bit, until you are friendly status.  I think it takes around 30.  I do not know what this does, but I assume it will allow the NPCs in Ravenholdt to eventually give you quests.  I did this quest at lvl 31, and no other quests in ravenholdt were opened at that time. | The easiest way to search for the path that leads to the Manor is to find location 76,25. It is in the Hillsbrad Foothills area. NOT the Durnholde Keep area. I am including a picture of the path from the bottom.

*Also. There is some good items for sale within the Manor that cost you just silver (~24s), but go for 2+ gold at the AH.

*And, if you are alliance, and do not have the flight path yet. Jump down the mountain side to Chillwind Point. It's north across the river. It saves you time later on.

Sorry. I don't know the horde routes.

Side note: If you collect the emblems from the NPC's in the Keep BEFORE going up. It saves you some time too. | Subject: "Content Incomplete"
My advice... Don't bother with this yet. There is no compelling reward that makes the travel worth your time. The lands you have to go through have higher level beasts (30-35), and your getting awfully close to Horde country.

The official response I got from a GM regarding this is that the content is incomplete. If you have a few hours to spare and must give it a try here's the skinny.

1) You can do this at level 24, you only need to cast detect traps. Find the chest, and cast detect traps then you will see a flag that says don't open this and you�re done. You do not need to disarm traps as is inferred from other comments.
2) The next quest is to go and pickpocket a bunch of level 20-22ish thief�s and get badges. For each badge you get your reputation in the syndicate, goes up. You need about 30 to become friendly and you�re done.

FIRST NOTE: If you run into a series of pockets that say no loot, someone�s been there before you. Start killing them. Kill on one side of the castle, move to the other side and come back to pick pocket. If you bring a friend, have them kill while you sneak. The goal is to get them to re-spawn so they have loot again.

SECOND NOTE: The badges quest will never appear in your quest log. This may seem borked but it�s not. AFAICT This quest is a Required Item to Initiate quest requiring you to get the badges first before taking the quest and as soon as you take the quest you will complete it for a faction point. This makes it a little weird to turn in too in that you have to talk to a guard 30 times for each badge and press complete quest 30 times.

3) When you reach friendly status the guards will refer you to talk to the Wolfe. This is a guy in a suit inside the mansion. You can�t talk to him. This is where the content is incomplete as of 1/11/05. | Subject: "The path"
I haven't saw one post here about the actual location of this path so I will post it. the path is located in hillsbrad foothills
the coordinates are 75,23 - that is the beginning of the path, then go up and after two turns you will enter a small cave, inside there is a chest, DO NOT OPEN IT, use detect traps instead, after using it you will see a blue diamond above the chest, go closer and the quest will be completed ( at least that is how I completed it)
