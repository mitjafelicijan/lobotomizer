Xavaric (39,22) also drops  [Flute of Xavaric]
it begins a Quest "Flute of Xavaric" | Subject: "Suggestion"
Go as direct to killing Xavaric as you can.  He drops a flute that starts a quest that require you to kill a bunch of tricksters, betrayers, and hellcallers in order to collect 5 "felbind".  So kill Xavaric as early as possible so you don't have to was a lot of time killing extra.  Of course, if you just like killing these guys (they drop rune cloth pretty well), knock yourself out.  There's plenty of them. | Take out Xavaric first. One of his drops starts another quest (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=939) that can be done while killing the satyrs for this one. | Subject: "!^!"
The camp is located at 41.18 "Jadefire Run" | Entrance is 43,11 and every mob is their in the area, you can find Xavariac at 39, 22 (it's down the sloop)
