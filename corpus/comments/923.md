Drop wasn't that bad for me.. killed like 12-15 of the Elder Timberlings and got my 5 Moss.

To get to them just go to the Oracle Glade and turn right till you hit a Lake/River. | Subject: "You All Are CONFUSING! Maybe this will help."
I read most of the posts on here and you all really confused me.  The place you can find the timberlings that drop the tumbers is about half way between Dolnaar and Darnassus.  It is north of the road (43, 41).  The south end of the lake makes like a circle (it pools) and there is a dock... if you see that you are in the right spot.  All of the different types of timberlings will drop the required items.  I only had to kill like 10 of them to get the five tumors.  DO NOT GO TO LAKE AL'AMETH the timberlings there do no drop the tumors. I hope this will help and happy hunting. | Subject: "Alliens tloc, teldrassil, wellspring lake"
There are lots of timberling who will drop the tumors at 43,26 good luck... | Subject: "Rellian Greenspyre"
For those who have been mislead, you can find Rellian Greenspyre at the Cenarion Enclave in Darnassus. The coordinates are (38,21).
