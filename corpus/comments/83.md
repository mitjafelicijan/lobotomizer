Head towards the Eastval logging camp, before you get there on the left in the tower of azora, Brackwell pumpkin patch is directly across from it on the right. Also if your a Warlock, Surena Caledon can be found in one of the houses to get locket for Warlock quest. | I highly recommend going to the Brackwell Pumpkin Patch. It is the best place to get the drops most definitely.

Brackwell Pumpkin Patch: 69,79

However if you wish to be complicated, here are some others.
