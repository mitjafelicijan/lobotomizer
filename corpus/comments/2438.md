**SPOILER**

The Emerald is inside the village of Starbreeze. I found it in the fartest building, but I bet the location is random.

Move your cursor on every object (chests, furnitures...) until the item selected becomes highlighted and usable.

Once you acquire the item, a pendant, from the drawer you need to open it (right click on it) to find the Emerald.
