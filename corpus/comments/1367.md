# Quest Title: Magram Alliance
# Quest URL: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1367
# Before accepting this quest or Gelkis Alliance (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1368) it is a good idea to check the rewards for the final quest in the series since you can only complete one series without taking a lot of effort faction grinding after finishing one series.

The rewards for the Gelkis Alliance series are:
-Gelkis Marauder Chain (mail chest: 14 agi, 7 str https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6773)
-Uthek's Finger (off-hand: 5 stam, 5 int, 5 spi https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6774)

The rewards for the Magram Alliance series are:
-Magram Hunter's Belt (leather belt: 8 agi, 9 stam https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6788)
-Ceremonial Centaur Blanket (cloak: 2 int, 9 spi https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6789) | Subject: "Rewards v. XP"
      If you really want leather armor or you find yourself questing in South Desolace often, choose to pick the Magram rather than the Gelkis. If you want mail armor or you find yourself questing in East Desolace often, go ahead and side with the Gelkis.
      I would side with the Gelkis just because it's much easier to kill the Magram for rep or quests. The Gelkis are mostly in that cave (oh, how I hate that cave!) and the huge hole in the ground that's hard to kill in. Magrams have water in their camp true, but all the more reason to pick them. No close-quarters fighting for you casters, and flee into the water if you get too many adds.
      In reality, it's all up to you. | Subject: "Ends at"
This quest ends at 75.68 | Fun facts:
Each kill gives you 20 reputation, while taking 100 reputation from the opposing faction.
Therefore, it will take you 50 kills in order to become Friendly with the prescribed faction. | Here's an overall of the quests and their exp rewards...
- Magram -
:. Assault on the Kolkar .: 2550 exp. Difficulty: Easy at proper level.
:.Broken Tears.: 2850 exp. Difficulty: Easy at proper level.
:.Gizmo for Warug.: 2050 exp Difficulty: Damn easy, may cost you some money.
:.Khan Shaka.: 2850 exp Difficulty: Moderate, may require a group.
:.Khan Hratha.: 1700 exp, and rewards mentioned in above posts. Difficulty: Moderate - Difficult depending on level and class. May require a group.
Total EXP: 12000

- Gelkis -
:.Raid on the Kolkar.: 2550 exp Difficulty: Easy at proper level
:.Stealing supplies.: 1350 exp, 18 silver in quest rewards Difficulty: Easy at proper level
:.Ongeku.: 2850 exp Difficulty: Difficult. The camp where Ongeku is crowded, and they're all runners.
:.Khan Jen.: 2850 exp Difficulty: Moderate.
:.Khan Hratha.: 4300 exp Difficulty: Difficult.
Total exp: 13900

Although the Gelkis quests are a bit harder, they do seem to yield more exp and there's some extra silver from one of the quests. I honestly don't know why the final magram quest yields less exp than the gelkis final quest. They're both the same. >_> | Subject: ">.<"
Gelkis are at  39.90 at Desolace | I read through the advice given for both chains, and considered the gear rewards, but to be honest, what is most important is the XP, right? Naturally, the Alliance scum get more in the chain (typical Blizzard) than the awesome Horde with the faction introduction quests.

(Alliance)
Brutal Politics - 2,050xp
Assault - 2,550xp
or
Strange Alliance - 2,050xp
Raid on the Kolkar - 2,550xp

(Horde)
Gelkis Alliance - 660xp
or
Magram Alliance - 660xp

(Both)

Gelkis Questline
Stealing Supplies - 1,350xp
Ongeku - 2,850xp
Khan Jehn - 2,850xp
Khan Hratha - 4,300xp and this or this

Total = 12,010xp

Magram Questline
Broken Tears - 2,650xp
Gizmo for Warug - 2,050xp
Kahn Shaka - 2,850xp
Khan Hratha - 4,300xp and this or this

Total = 12, 510xp - but costs the price of one Advanced Target Dummy server dependant (1gold 30silver on my server - not worth 500xp)

Basically, Alliance scum get more XP than Hord regardless of the chain you pick, or if you're crazy and grind back rep to do both chains. Magram rewards an extra 500xp, but you'll need to pay out some cash for it, so factor this into your choice. The gear rewards are pretty meh, and it's likely you have better - but if you somehow have worse, it might be worth it to you.

Warug is located north-east of the village, on a hill. Look for a path that isn't to steep into the mountains. He will, of course, show up on the minimap when you get close enough. | NPC to turn in the quest is at 74, 68 at the top of a small hill with a campfire.
