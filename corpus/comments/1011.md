Christ dude...stop confusing people, the correct location (after dying 12 times following these instruction above) is 75,72.  Do not go anywhere near the Warsong Lumber Camp.  From the NPC who gave the quest, head to Splintertree Post (southwest), from there head south directly.  The small camp (where the poison is) is a bit north of Felfire Hill. | Subject: "Spoiler"
South Eastern part of the map, south of Solace Glade/road, east of the road to The Barrens. You will find a tent and table of alchemy products surrounded by the Forsaken (undead). Pretty easy to solo at 33+.

2350 XP at 34 (when the quest is green). | It's on a table outside of the cave. Coords: 75, 71 (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=18036) | Subject: "Bottle Disappeared..."
I got interrupted when I first tried to get the "open" the bottle 'cause a Horde rogue ambushed me. Well, when I went back to the table and tried to get it, the bottle was gone!

I abandoned the quest, reacquired it, and went back, and even tried restarting the game a few times with no luck. I can't find the bottle on the table anymore :(.

Anyone know if this is a bug?
