53,14

Just outside the NE house, shows on map as gold dot | Subject: "For the Rest of Us:"
They are located in Ivar Patch | Found him at 53,13 Just outside one of the houses. | Subject: "easy quest"
Take the main road (that goes North/South down the center of the map) up to the Ivar Patch. This is at almost the most northern point on the map. He is waiting outside a house, pretty obvious. Cosmos Users, coordinates 53,13. | This quest is just a breadcrumb quest. Once you do  Wild Hearts quest,  Lost Deathstalkers quest will NEVER be available to you.
