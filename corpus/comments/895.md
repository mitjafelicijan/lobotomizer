He can be in front of any of the three camps running along the shore.Â  He respawns within 2 minutes once he's killed so keep an eye out for him. | Subject: "."
He must randomly spawn at the different tents in the area so if you don't see him straight away make sure you check all the tents in teh area..for me he was at the far south pair of tents.

For those who need co-ordinates it was 63,49 on this occasion. | Subject: "<Blank>"
64, 47 | Solod as a level 13 mage with only minor difficulty. Might be hard as other classes until level 14 or 15. He was located at 64, 47 near a tent. Human wearing a red long-coat.
