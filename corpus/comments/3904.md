# Subject: "Guarded by Defias"
Each one of the grape pots are guarded by one or two of the Defias, and they may not aggro until you attempt to open the pot. So to be safe and avoid interruption when opening, kill any Defias standing close by before trying to open one of the pots. | Subject: "<Blank>"
