53,56 | Located at 54, 56 in Dustwallow Marsh (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=20727). | Zoom the world map out until you can see the continent. Draw a line from Gadgetzan north to Ratchet. The crash is on that path; apparently zepplins go straight down when something goes wrong. :-) | Subject: "More accurate and CLEAR screeshot"
Where the arrow is is where the crash site is.

http://usghosting.com/viper/zep-crash.jpg | 55,51 - is the 'entrance' over the mountains. If you came from the water, that is. The mobs in the water and around the crash site are 39-43. You can easily do this at 36ish..just watch the aggro and you're fine. I also find that aggro around the actual crash site is none-existent. | Subject: "Experience/Reputation"
3300 XP at level 40. This quest also increased my reputation with Ratchet. | Subject: "Sneak your way in!"
I managed to do this quest without dieing and without having to fight a single creature/foe.

I walked from Ratchet over the shore line from about Northwatch Hold to Dustwallow Marsh. I entered the water near Theramore Isle and swam under its bridge (since I'm horde) towards the more western shore. In between the bridge and the shore are some sea creatures, which you can easily evade.
After swimming by Theramore, I exited the water at about 58.52. If you look around a bit there, you can find a way up the mountain. There's a level 40/41 giant spider there, which you can sneak by if your timing is right. Once you're past it you can walk to the south over the mountain foot, to evade a few slimes. Then you'll see the wreck and can retrieve the crate.

How you get out is up to you. I hearthstoned.
