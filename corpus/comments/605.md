Drop isnt the worst but the re-spawn is good so it shouldnt take long...Finished this as a 36 Tauren Hunter with Gorilla pet (Kong)
Had a 37 human Warior (Malol) getting in the way but it was good drops for all..
Oh and if you dont have coords its on the western shore..

I am editing my post to remove my comments as I am an idiot and had put some erroneous information in it!

Carry on... nothing to see here.

I found them at 23,18. Just south of Zul'Kunda on the shore.
