# Subject: "an alternate way"
you kno you can just take the ship to menethil from auberdine, then from menethil take the ship to theramore in dustwallow right? then from there swim north and you'll get there in like 5 minutes... | Subject: "MagXan is right"
The quickest way to go there is through Theramore(to walk/swim north to Rachet from Theramore).

Taken for granted that you are now at Darnassus, in order to go to Theramore, you need to

either go to Auberdine -> Menethil -> Theramore using the boats

OR

if you have the Azhara fight path, fly Darnassus -> Auberdine -> Astranaar(Ashenvale) -> Azhara -> Theramore.
