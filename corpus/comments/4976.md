Ok this is the quest in plain english, i can't understand why people are having such an issue with it. This is how i did it, with out failing.

Step1: Get initial quest of lock trainer in SW, who sends you to Menara in Ratchet.

Step2: Get the quest of Menara, then the second quest of one of her acolytes.

Step3. Go to Desolace, Kill an infernal, and just before it dies, use the Emerald given to you to capture it's soul. (Like using DrainSoul).

Step4. Go and kill a Summoner at the Coven.

Step5. Go to Dustwallow Marsh and find Tabatha, in a house, in The Quagmire.

Step6: Get a level 60 to meet you at Tabatha.

Step7: Accept final part of Quest of Tabatha.

Step8: Follow Tabatha to garden at side of house, where she summons demon.

Step9: Send in Voidwalker, DoT demon, and shadowbolt it, while Level 60 does the rest.

Step10: With 2 mins to spare, go back in house and speak with Tabatha.

Step11: Go back to Manara in Ratchet and Quest is complete.

I felt the need to write this as some people seem to find it hard/confusing. This should clear that up :)

Also as someone else mentioned choose if you want fire or shadow as your path.

Good Luck :).. and i did this at level 36 | Depending on which quest you selected your rewards will be one of the following:
