It is a random drop in Duskwood. Nothing more needs to be said. | Subject: "Drops"
I got the book from a skeleton in the cemetary south of the town.. we had two drop in killing the 20 skeletons for a quest. | This quest starts from "An Old History Book", which drops randomly from mobs in Duskwood. | Subject: "Royal Library - 74,8"
/tloc 74,8 in Stormwind Keep | Subject: "Comments"
This book does NOT drop for all members of the group.  One person will get it, and then you do have to AGAIN hope for the book to drop for any other members of the group that want it as well. 

Wanted to put this so someone else that needs this information will have accurate information since my partner and I have been working on this several hours with him unsure if he actually had done it, but thinking that he had not. 

So Again, EACH person gets a chance on the book not ALL members of the group as of this date, 03-06-06.

And it is again off of any Random mob in the zone. | loc. 74, 7.4 in Stormwind Keep. You then get a different quest once you turn the book in, called Southshore
