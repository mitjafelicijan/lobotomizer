Their spawns are constant. Goto the graveyard (east exit).

Look at the bridge that is further up ahead. Then move to the hill that is to the right of that bridge. There is one between the trees.

Now move further down south west. There is one close by near the following tree (small island).

Keep going passed another tree. When on the next small island (with a black spot in the grass) turn east aim for between the 2 trees.

There is one more further ahead between all the trees and near a spider. When you move a feet or 10 you end up on the road again.

All are on yellowish grass.

These guys are on the islands at around 39,23.
They're stealthed, so run around the little piles of stuff on the islands until you find them. | The Theramore Infiltrators are stealthed, non-aggressive elves and can be found in the swamp surrounding Brackenwall. They're not difficult to kill but they can be hard to spot if you attempt this quest in the low to mid 30's. The hardest part is avoiding the wandering Mire Beasts, Snappers, Crocolisks and other assorted nasties.
