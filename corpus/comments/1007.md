If you look on your Map (hotkey: M), you will see "THe Zoram Strand", right about the word "THE" there is a little part of the land that stick sout.  If you place yourself right about the word 'the' when looking for this itme, you will be very close.  Just look on the ground, a little white part will be sticking out, youc an't even tell it's a statue. IT's by other rubbish.  ANyways, when u move ur cursor over it and ur close, it will turn to the gear letting u know u can loot it! =P | This quest leads to: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1009 | Subject: "Statuette Location"

If you do not have coordinates, you can find him by taking the turn-off road from Maestra's point and following the mountain around. If you find the horde camp... You've gone too far =D

I found the statuette at 14, 20.
If you do not have coordinates, look for a big white rectangle building on your map. From there, go southwest to the coast.
