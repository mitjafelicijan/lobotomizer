# Quest ID: 8182
# Quest Title: The Hand of Rastakhan

# This is part of a long chain quest designed to familiarize you with Zul'Gurub and the Zandalar Tribe. Much of the rewards are decent for their level. The Faded Hakkari Cloak is only slightly worse than everyone's favorite Hide of the Wild. Definitely a worthwhile chain for someone that doesn't want to shell out for the Hide.

Here's the full quest chain:
- Screecher Spirits(Feralas) - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3520
- The Prophecy of Mosh'aru(Zul'Farrak) - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3520
- The Ancient Egg(Hinterlands) - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4787
- The God Hakkar(Temple of Atal'Hakkar) - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3528
- The Lost Tablets of Mosh'aru(Eastern Plaguelands) - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5065
- The Final Tablets(Lower Blackrock Spire) - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4788
- Confront Yeh'kinya(Tanaris) - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8181
- The Hand of Rastakhan(Stranglethorn Vale) - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8182 | This seems to be the end of the chain.
Guessing it will be updated when the Zul'Gurub patch releases (Phase 4). | Subject: "Any followup?"
Is there a followup to this quest, for which this is a prerequisite?  I didn't do this quest until I was already Exalted with Zandalar Tribe and had finished all the quests from Yojamba Island.  I finished this quest and Molthor didn't offer me any followup, so I'm wondering if it leads to another chain somewhere.
