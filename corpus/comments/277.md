Note to self and anyone else that keeps forgetting where to turn in quest 56,40 | Confirmed - 42,30 to 32, 30 has easy pulls. Many singles around the camps in this area but still a poor drop rate. | Subject: "Fire Taboo | Flint Loot"
Loot - Mosshide Fenrunners - S/W of IRONBANDS TOMB

Simple :) | Subject: "New look."
Did this at 26. I was killing Brutes and Trappers these were more my level but also dropped the flints and alot more often was done in like 15 min by trimming camps (taking outer ones only)

Also reward is 1850

The Fenrunners drop significantly higher than anything I saw. I got my 9 flint off of 12 or 13 kills. I found lots of them running around by themself in the northernmost part of Mosshide Fen, but there are probably easier places to find them.
