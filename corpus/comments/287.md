--Getting There--
Walk the long way to the middle of Iceflow lake (33,42) and kill all normal animals you may encounter. Once you arrive at the Camp Brewnall Village (29,46) Head south West to the cave "FrostMane Hold" (24,50).

--Part 1 (Kill all 5)--
When you start see see trolls slowly pull the outside defenders 1 by 1 and then make it to the cave. just keep pulling them and killing them untill all 5 are slain.

--Part 2--
For this i reccomend if you have any items or food that will increace stamina use them now. SImply kill the forst 3-4 in the cave so its safe (carefull not to get mobbed by 2) and then run as fast as possible to the end of the entrace passage. Jump down from there onto the ice and run around that snow/ice mound in the middle and it SHOULD say (Quest Frostmne Hold - Area Discorver) or something and then you will probably die but that doesnt matter because you are under 9 simply talk to the Spirit Healer and walk the 30 feet to the quest hand in and theres 750 exp.
