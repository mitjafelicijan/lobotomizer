There is some misconception as to the amount of Emblems needed. As of Patch 2.+, you only needed 10 or 11 to hit Friendly. But in Classic, that's not true.

The Emblems only give 100 rep per turn in. As does the previous quest. So if you turn in the quest leading here (The Manor, Ravenholdt), you will start with 100/3000 Rep towards Friendly.

So you must grab 29 of the Emblems in order to reach Friendly status.

Done on an Undead Rogue, so no Reputation bonuses applicable. Humans, YMMV.
