Kill the Rot hide brusers and plague warrior on fersile isle east of selpulcher the Ultimate UI location is 66,31 that area | If you are doing this quest and happen to get "A Talking Head" (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=3317), don't make the mistake I did and leave the castle to turn in the ichor quest. The questline for talking head takes place in that castle on Fenris Island, so if that quest item drops for you, might as well finish it off since you've cleared all the castle out that far. | Subject: "65,26"
