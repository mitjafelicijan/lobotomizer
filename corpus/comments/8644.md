# Subject: "His location"
He is in Hordemar City in LBRS, on the left as you cross the first wooden bridge. | Subject: "easy at L70"
As a L70 warlock, I was able to walk by all the mobs without fighting any of them.  A little nervewracking, but completely soloable.

When you enter LBRS, do not take the "shortcut" but instead walk around to the left.  You must cross the first wooden bridge to get to the Elder.
