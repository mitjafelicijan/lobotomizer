And my name will be written in the Book Of Legends | Subject: "finding a location with coords without a ui"
Simple to find the location of something if you have the coordinates but don't have the coordinate UI mod. First coordinate is the horizontal ref. Left side of your map is 0.
All the way to the right is 100. Half way from left to right is 50. 1/4 way from left side moving to the right is 25. The second coordinate is the up-down one. Top is 0. Bottom of your map/screen is 100. So, coordinate 25,25 is in the top left corner of the map (your monitor with the map at full screen).Â  If players would just realize this they would not have to ask where something is when they have the coordinates but not the UI mod. I have a post-it not next to my screen with arrows on it. That is my UI mod for this feature. Pretty simple, eh? | Coords. 37.15 anywhere in that area ^_^ | Murdering druids on behalf of the burning legion. Classic horde quest! | Subject: "Son of Cenarius"
As a Druid I find the best strategy for NPCs with pets is to root the pet, debuff the NPC and start wailing on him in bear form. When the pet arrives, roar at both of them. Finish off the NPC, change back to caster form to debuff the pet and DOT him, drop into cat form and annihilate the pet.
