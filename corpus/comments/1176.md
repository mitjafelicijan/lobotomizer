# Have to kill Salt Flats Scavengers. Good location is at 87,66 around a large skeleton in the sand. Soloed as a level 32 Dwarf Warrior easily. | Subject: "their location"
there dotted all around there, but at 85,66 there is a large group. btw every single kill of the salt flats scavengers drops one of the required hollow vulture bones.

Vultures can be found all the way around the track, but there is a small camp of them halfway down the track on the east side of it.

The bones are a reasonably common drop, maybe once every 2 or 2.5 kills.

When you get this quest, make sure you get all the other quests at the race track too. There is one to kill scorpians, another to kill turtles, and a 4th to collect race car debris. Having all fou at the same time lets you circle the race track killing things, and virtually everything you do contributes to one quest or another. | Subject: "Vultures"
I found 6 vultures at 88,65
Killed them all and after 20 minutes they had still not respawned.  The respawn rate on the Vultures is not good at all.  Good Luck All. | The drop rate of Hollow Vulture Bones appears to be 100%.
