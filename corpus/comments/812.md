Make sure to know where Kor'Ghan is and how to get back to him if ya wanna finish the quest quick (47,53 Cleft of Shadows). He won't be marked at this time, but at least you will know where to look.

Find Rhinag amongst some tall, out of place looking rocks at 41,18 and talk to him when ready. As mentioned by others, you got 45 mins.

Run back to Ogrimar and find Kor'Ghan, who is now quest marked. Talk to him and get the next part.

Run back outside, near where you found Rhinag and kill scorps till you have enough venom sacks, or whatever.

Back to Kor'Ghan again to get antidote. Then back to Rhinag to complete.
