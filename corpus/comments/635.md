Location of the cyrstal ::Â  62,34 | There is no followup. This quest is just a good lure for Horde to pick up the Princess series, beginning with The Princess Trapped. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=642) | Subject: "How to do this quest"
Ok. You get the crystal NORTH of the circle with the water elementals. IT send you to the east past Hammerfall to kill kobolds in the gorge. You pick up 12 shards, head all the way through the caverns and find a second large crystal. Activate the crystal for the next part.
The next part is taking on the Fire, Water, Lightning elementals to get to the center and activate the stone to recieve a key. Then you go to the rock elementals and you activate the stone there. ONce activating the Rock Elemental stone you recieve the next part.

This is the point where you need to kill Fozruk (The elite giant).

Can't tell you what to do next, cause this is where I am at on this quest. No clue as to what the reward is. | Tap the crystal at its just 62, 33, just west of Hammerfall. | The crystal is at 62, 33.
And the crystal gives the quest,
[37] The Princess Trapped.. that is NOT a followup quest =)

No one cares where you got the quest. It is a pain to read all these posts where people have gotten the quest. Obviously most of us have gotten the quest otherwise we would not be here trying to find out information on it. If you must know I pulled this quest out of my arse after a night of binge drinking. The Crystal is Northeast of Refugee Point about an inch past Dabyrie's Farmstead for those of you without COCMOS and for those with COSMOS the Coords given are dead on. I got another quest after finding it called "The Princess Trapped" which involves gathering 12 motes of Myzrael from Kobolds and bring them to Drywhisker Gorge.
