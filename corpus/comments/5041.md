yes they are at 59,24 | The supplies can spawn in multiple spots (relatively close to one another).

found my crate at 58,27 in the barrens | Subject: "Easiest Location"
There's a no-fight crate at 58,25 under the big tree. It's not guarded. | Easiest one is at 58,25; come over the little hill, kill one Mystic, done. Can get the named for "The Disruption Ends" here as Kreenig is in the same camp area.
