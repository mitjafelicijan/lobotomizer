They are around 56,7 | slugs can be found in the area of 56.10
They are found in tool buckets near the broken down robots (shredders I guess) and on the structure in the water

Speak to the Wizzlecrank's Shredder at 57 7 for the quest Ignition while you are there. https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=858

That quest was easy and Im a level 19 Undead Warlock first time playing. Just pick off the venture capital guys one by one. The slugs are in the little buckets around the permimeter of the lake.

Also, before taking them back...on the shore of the far side of the lake is a shredder who needs his ignition key. The supervisor guy drops it when killed, back on the close side shore of the lake. Get 1350 exp just for that part.
