Entrance to where you find the sacs (49,28)

When you get there you'll see where they are, but if you don't, here are the coords:
1. sac, left when u enter (49,26)
2. sac, by entrance to cave (51,27)
3. sac, right side of the gulch (50.25)
4. sac, right side, by cactus' (50,24)
5. sac, at the end of the gulch, left hand side, by cactus' (49,22)

Run through the gulch in direction of Orgrimmar for the shortest path to complete the quest.

Cair. | The above posted is completely correct but I just wanted to clarify some coordinates to help people out.

To pick up this quest you need to see Rezlak, he can be found at: 46,23 for those with coordinates. That's just south of Ogrimmar on the right hand side of the road, for those of you without coordinates :).

To confirm the above stated, Razorwind Canyon is located at (51,32)

Once in the canyon, just look for the bags on the ground and loot them. Then head back to Rezlak and he'll give you the next quest. | Alliance characters can do this quest too, though they will not gain any Darkspear or Orgrimmar reputation for it, only Ratchet reputation.
