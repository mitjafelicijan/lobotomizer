If you're doing this quest, you can do the At War With Scarlet Crusade quest too.  The tower located at 52,68 will give you more than enough rings and can get Missionaries Zealots and the Captain too. | Subject: "<Blank>"

  49:68 | You are required to have completed https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=427 before this quest becomes available. | Subject: "info"
Head to the tower near the pumpkin farm and kill all the humans in the area of the tower. Easy experience and lots of linen to loot.

My result:
You gain 625 experience.
Received 1 Silver 75 Copper. | Got a lot at the tower at 52, 68. | Subject: "insignia rings"
while you're at 49,68 you should do the Capt. Perrine quest (At War With The Scarlet Crusade pt 2). He's just inside the tower. I got Insignia Rings off Zealots, Msiisonaries, and Perrine himself.
