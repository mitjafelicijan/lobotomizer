The potion is only used for fighting Thule Ravenclaw a 24 elite caster who uses Hex of the Ravenclaw.  This spell shrinks you and severely diminishes your physical and magical damage output so it is important to remove it during the fight.  This potion has multiple charges in case you fail an attempt of Assault on Fenris Isle.  After completing this quest it is useless and may be safely discarded.  The spell mentioned above is Curse of Thule and does a minor spirit debuff which comes from the Rot Hides on the island and is not related to this potion.  This quest chain is the culmination of a chain that begins with The Dead Fields https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=437/the-dead-fields | Subject: "Chain"
