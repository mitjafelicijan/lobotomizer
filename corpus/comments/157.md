That Stitches thingy likes to hang out near the hermit's hut and I got aggro'd three times by him trying to give the thread to Abercrombie. So I gave up and came back a little later - he was gone and there wasn't any problem. Anyone else have this problem? >_> | Subject: "Abercrombie's Shack"
His shack is at 28,31 for all those of you who use co-ords... | Subject: "whoa"
This thread truly delivers!

No lie! | The NPC your looking for is called Abercrombie located @ 28,31 in Duskwood
