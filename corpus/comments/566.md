# Subject: "how to get"
you have to compleet the WANTED: Syndicate personell quest before you can get this one. | Subject: "Found him"
I found him just East of Lordamere Lake, East of the farm house in a small encampment with 2 tents and a bunch of Syndicate.  There are two other camps there too.  So if you can't find him in the tavern basement check the 3 camps NW of the town. | He is located in 4 different places. Check this out to see the places:

https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=2306 | You have to complete the other Wanted quest on the sign before this becomes available: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=549 . | i found him in the Strahnbrad Inn downstairs behind the Kegs.

OK Here is the real deal on Vardus...

if you do not locate him in the tent camps he will be in the INN in STRAHNBRAD in the lower level where the giant kegs of beer are... | He usually spawns in those camps, but sometimes he shows up next to Strahnbrad. Had that happen last night.

If you are doing this solo, be VERY careful when looking through the camps. You can look from a distance, but be aware of the many patrolling mobs. Syndicate Sentries and Mountain Lions here have both long patrol routes and large aggro ranges. It's easy to wind up fighting anywhere from two to six mobs if you aren't careful. | Can now confirm, hadn't done WANTED:Syndicate Personnel so I backtracked and did the quest for 180 exp at level 40, this unlocked this quest on the same wanted poster
