The WoW website actually has more information on getting these items, and yes the quests are repeatable.

If you really want some of these rewards I think you should get revared with the argent dawn!

To get revared easely, farm from lvl 50-55 at least. (Try to not complete any quests until you are honored)this will help you get revared really fast by complete them when you are honored and wont be given any rep with the Argent Dawn anymore by killing.

The reason why I think you should do this is because you need 20 of each mark as honored and only 7 when revared. Now you may think "How the hell am I supposed to manage that!" but the fact is that you gain lots and lots of money/rep/exp when farming skeletal flayers, sorcerer and slavering ghouls.

I missed the chance of being revared so I had to buy all the Bone Fragments, Savage Fronds, Dark Iron Scraps, Core of Elements at AH for a huge amount of money. I layed down over 100 gold to get that Supply Bag!When I already spend over 60 gold I realised I only had to buy an 18 slot bag at AH for 50 gold.

So if you got the time and the will you can have an 18 slot bag for free if you get revared!

Good luck! :)
