there's a bunch at 62,30 east of CH near the mountains. | Subject: "Dredge Strikers"
Found a bunch of them at around 65,42. Good luck. | 66.35 is where I'm finding them, but they are all over, non-tameable and have a brutal dash if you are knocked off guard. Be careful if you are under lvl 55, as the mobs are 54-60+ it's also a Battleground PVP area, so becareful of Stealth pvp'ers.

A Great Tactic if you don't mind waiting is, there are 4 Level 60 Cenarion Outriders sitting on Cat Mounts. Hit the critter then run back to them and they will kill it for you. Be watchful, there is a group of 10 lvl 60 bad guys that ride on the same path/patrol, that kill all 4 of these guys and will kill you if you aren't 60+.
