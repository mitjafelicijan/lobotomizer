# Subject: "I soloed this quest."
I am a 39 shaman and soloed this quest by having the 5 bodygards that wander around help me.  I saw the calvary and saw the 5 forsaken bodygaurds and started the brawl right in the middle of them i killed one and they killed one and i died but rezed right their and with the help of the 2 bodyguards left we took down Valorcall.  It was pretty awesome. | Subject: "Where they Spawn"
The Cavalery Walks Between The alliance outpost to Stromgarde Keep and actually enter there.

The easiest way to find them is to Camp up at the entrance to stromgarde that ajoins to the road.

Give it 5 mins and theres yours for the gutting. | Subject: "Roams"
He roams the way between Refuge Pointe and Stromgarde. Pretty easy if you sap him and kill guards first. (42 rogue,35 priest)
