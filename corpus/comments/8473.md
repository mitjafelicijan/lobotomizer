Take the road south between Sunsail Anchorage and Fairbreeze Village. The coordinates are 34,81 | Subject: "Why would treants be..."
Why would treants be INside a building? And the exact coords are 34.7839049, 80.2964701. =p Stop debating over one point. If someone can't find what they're looking for because it's one point off, they should be making macaroni art, not playing WoW. | I found these in The Scorched Grove (32, 83).
