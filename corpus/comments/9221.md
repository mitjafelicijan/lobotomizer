Do I have this correct? In the case of Rugged Armor Kits, I can submit 25 (125 rugged leather = approximately 165 kills) kits to get either 1 Dawn Insignia or 1 Crusade Insignia. 60 Crusade/Dawn Insignias (7500 rugged leather or approximately 9900 kills) get me "Friend of the Dawn," where I can buy an 18-slot bag, a decent leather helm or an underpowered dagger with OK stats.

At an average of 1 minute per kill (not including time & travel overhead), that would be approximately 165 hours (almost a week) of killing whatever had the best rugged leather yield (WS Yetis?).

I'm not sure I could maintain my level of enthusiasm for the game (not to mention not wanting to ever see another yeti again) long enough to finish this. Is this what is really intended or are we just providing a mechanism for farmers?
