# Subject: "Deleted NPC?"
Did the NPC for the quest get deleted? I can find him anywhere in the front area where he's supposed to be. | Subject: "No XP"
I did this with my level 29 Rogue and even with a level 3 Mage. You dont have to help defeat the scourge, but when he's killed you see the yellow mark and u can take the quest at any level.

However, it's not very useful because you cannot use the items as a low level and you do not receive any Exp.

It did made me neutral with Argent Down, and gave me 200 reputation points. | Subject: "From Scourge Event"
I think this was a part of that Scourge event that took place a while back where undead showed up all over the world. I'm going to destroy mine. :(
