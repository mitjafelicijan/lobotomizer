right off the docks (facing the water, head to the end of them and go left/south), piece of cake. | Subject: "Easy once you find the ship"
The ship and Shade of Elura are at 32,45.  For those without the cosmos, go down the dock from Auberdine, turn left where the boat to Menethril would be docked and jump in the water.

Shade of Elura ('ghost girl') is wondering around the bottom of the ocean by the ship - around the center of the wreck.  She may be hard to see but once you spot her, be sure to click on her so that you can spot her again easily even if you have to come up for the air before you go back in to attack.

Crates of ore you'll find all over the ocean floor around the ship.  I found a bunch of them to the East of the ship - 33,46 | Subject: "description"
As everyone else has said if you go to the end of the pier where you would get the ship to Menethil. Jump off there and swim down.
The ghost is easy to beat but watch out for the creatures down there.
As for the crates they are a pain to find.
Swim around the area, as if heading for the shore, you should find them.

It is worth pointing out that if I hadn't checked on here I wouldn't have had a clue. The description for the quest sucks.
