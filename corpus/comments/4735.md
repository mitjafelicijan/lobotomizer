Both this part and the last part of the quest are easy, all you have to do is freeze the egg get close (not too close) and use the other item. Although it did take like 1 or 2 mins to collect the 8 eggs. You don't click on the eggs, just use the devices in your backpack. | Subject: "soloable in a cleared instance"
if your raid doesn't want to bother with your quest while they're in the rookery, just wait until you've killed General Drakkisath and finished the run.Â  from there you can jump straight down to the rookery, and as long as you don't pop any whelps, you should be able to finish the quest solo. | The eggs required for this quest are in the Rookery in Upper Blackrock Spire (UBRS). Simply freeze the eggs and slowly approach them and use the device provided by the quest to capture them. Getting to the eggs, however, does in fact require a raid. If your raid does not want to do your quest, just wait until they finish up and head back down to the Rookery and complete it yourself.
