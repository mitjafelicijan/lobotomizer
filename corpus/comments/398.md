It's in Brill, outside the Magistrate, Sevren's, building. Behind the mounted guard, Executor Zygand, to the left of the stairs, facing it.

Maggot Eye is to the North of Brill, in Garren's Haunt, which is an abandoned farm. He's inside a small building, sitting on a short hill, north of the farm itself.

Maggot Eye is level 10 and alone, besides two guards outside. He will fight alone if you sneak by the guards and fight inside. | Confirmed. He is in the smaller building located in the north of the farm.
Coordination: 58,30 | Maggot Eye is actually inside the little hut out there by the farm. | Its good to try and do this quest at the same time as:
