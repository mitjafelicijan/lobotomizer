# It sure is a good thing they added strength & agility to those boots for when I melee mobs as a mage.

You would think they would stop doing that by level 30. =/ | If you're wondering wtf the necklace is:

when i found it at the office at school on the ground (i dunno how it end up there, probably some idiot droped it)i wasn't expecting too much, when i start reading it, its actually quite a good story

game's background story can be great too. just because its a story that comes from a video game doesn't mean it sucks. | Subject: "plus"
alot of the things in this game are there just for you to have, its not always about improving your character, some things are good just to have. i'm doing this quest to to get the necklace, it means something, stats aren't everything
