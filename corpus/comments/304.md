# I've seen Balgaras in three different places: the second building on both the right and left of Dun Modr as you walk in, and at Direforge Hill, which is along the mountains southeast of Dun Modr. | Subject: "NOT in the Town"
I think they must have moved him. I've had 3 people SWEAR he was in the town looking place in the north, but after spending well over an hour there I never saw him. When I went to the eastern camps he was there. No fuss, no muss, no waiting. | Subject: "Immune to Shadow"
Those of you who rely on shadow (warlocks, shadow priests), make sure you don't waste your time with shadow spells 'cause he's immune. | Subject: "<Blank>"
He spawns in both Dun Modr and in the camps in eastern wetlands. If he isnt at one, he will be at the other. Theres only about a 5 minute delay on him spawning. | Subject: "<Blank>"
He spawn at camps on East and in Dun Mord.
Where he is spawned u can find blue Minion. If you see Minion u found exact location of the mage you have to cut ear off. | Subject: "Location"
