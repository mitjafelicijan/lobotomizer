# Subject: "This Can Be Tricky"
This quest can be rather tricky if you don't know where exactly to go. There are 3 different locations where harpies spawn. However, there's only one location of the three that will drop the feathers for this quest.Â  For those of you who do not use add ons, the harpies spawn behind Spirit Rise. For those of you who do use add ons, standing right outside the outskirts of the harpies spawn point is 32,19.
Hopefully this is helpful enough to all who have attempted this quest and became frustrated with trying to get the drops. | Subject: "<Blank>"
Matriarchs for the bronze feathers, Sorceress for the azure. Just go straight West/North of Thunder Bluff, you'll find some.
