54,40 coords are good.  It's more SW of windrider.    Statue description is correct.  Thanks. | Coordinates: 54, 40 in the Burning Steppes. | Subject: "Tablet of the Seven"
The Tablet is a stone monument in a ruined building near 53, 43. Due north of the letter "s" in the word "Ash" on the Burning Steppes map. | Tablet's at 54,40 to save you having to scroll down to find it because the guy who posted here 4 days before me decided to shill his YouTube channel instead of just posting the co-ords. | For Those Without Coords: Directions from Morgan's Vigil

Follow the main path until you come across the large tower at the Pillar Of Ash. Once you come up to the tower, which is right beside the path, head north. You should be a Dwarven statue with the quest object right beside it inside the ruins of a structure.
