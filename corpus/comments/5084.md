# The cauldron is in Felwood at (60, 5), top left of the mountain range at the top center.

The cauldron can be clicked on and its like talking to an NPC so you don't need to kill the mob, just run in, click it and escape.

But I killed the mob before I found that out :P | Subject: "<Blank>"
Dude, stop spreading wrong coordinates.Â  The CORRECT location is 60,6. | Just a warning, as well. The five mobs that are around the cauldron are linked, so be prepared to run if you can't fight all of them at once. | Subject: "<Blank>"
The cauldron is an instant action, so you don't need to kill the group camping it (I think it was three deadwoods and a winterfall). Just run in, exchange quests and run out. | Subject: "Another way"
If you're a hunter or a warlock, set your pet to attack the mob on the farthest side of the camp and while it keeps the mobs busy, you can run in and check the cauldron before running like hell. | Subject: "Druids"
Don't bother going in bear form, you can't interact with the cauldron while shapeshifted xD.

You can however cast a Regrowth and a Rejuv, run in there and click to complete quest, then keep healing yourself as best you can while the quest text scrolls and the 5 or 6 furbolgs wail on you :> Nature's Swiftness and Barkskin both very helpful.
