# Look for a large white crocolisk roaming the rivers of the Quagmire or the Dragonmurk. He has a pretty big patrol route, so you will likely be doing some running. He's level 45, non-elite, so finding him is the hardest part of the quest.

And if you forget where to turn this in, the guy is on Hunter Rise in Thunder Bluff. | The stretch of river leading north/northeast from STONEMAUL RUINS on your map is where you need to be, he swims up and down that. He is a huge brute, a dull white crocodile that is unmistakable, just check the screen and you'll not miss him. Easily found with Track Beasts as a Hunter.

47, 56 is where he met his end for me. | Subject: "<Blank>"
