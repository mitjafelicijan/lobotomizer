Wow, this was tough quest!

First, if you are alliance, pick up the Perenolde Tiara quest in the Stormwind Keep.

Next, go through the crack as mentioned above (34,53).  There are 4 Warmongers in this area: 3 outside the tower and one inside.  Watch the run patterns, because these guys roam a lot and cross each others paths.  They also cry out for help, so make sure not to attack them too closely.

You can actually stand on the castle wall and take an extra shot before they get to you.  This is because they have to run to the ramp and zig-zag to get to you.  Head towards the right side and look for the two-headed guy you need for the Tiara quest.

Head back and wait for the warmongers to re-spawn.  You'll have to tackle some enforcers as well.  I died twice taking the warmongers on early on.  They can crit up to 200 HP per swing and those boys swing fast!  Here's what I found that worked for me:

Engage mana shield
Open with fireball (if you have PoM, 2 fireballs)
Nova Freeze (back up)
Fire Blast
5 Cycles of Arcane Missles (you'll lose mana shield around 3rd cycle, that's OK)
Nova Freeze again
Arcane Missles
Fire Blast
Cone of Cold

Mana jade can also help here.  I have 1100 HP and 4986 mana.  Your health and mana will be very low after each encounter.
