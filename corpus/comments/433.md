Bonesnappers for Senator Mehr Stonehallow are found in the quary directly behind him... at coordinates 70,56 you will find the enterance to their ice cave. | On several characters that completed the quest a while ago, it now shows as available. | Subject: "whaaa"
they are not in the quarry they are in a cave in the quarry

theres a big thing too the north east if u stand in the quarry that looks like its made of ice
and thats theyre cave | I found the best place to hunt for Rockjaw Bonesnappers is around ronband's Compound is just southwest of Helm's Bed Lake, which is on the Eastern side of Dun Morogh.

For those of you with Cosmos or Titan Panel add-ons, the coordinates are are around 77,60

Note: If you're a warrior, this quest pairs well with "Ironband's Compound" pairs will with this quest, since the ore you're looking for is in the same area. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=1681)
