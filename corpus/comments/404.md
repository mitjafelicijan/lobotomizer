I got this quest at level 4. With my imp I could kill Rotting and Ravaged, but stayed with Rotting as they are lower. Rotting Dead are level 5-7, whereas Ravaged at almost always 7. Be careful from straying too far from the bridge area, past the graveyard. Behind the graveyard is where the Rot Hide Graverobbers and Rot Hide Mongrels hang out, and boy are they mean!
