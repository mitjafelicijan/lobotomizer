The drop rate does seem very low and the maps for where the things are are a little deceptive.

Best place to kill bunches of the turtles is 82, 56 near a derelict ship. | The turtles that you kill for this quest also drop Turtle Meat (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=3712).

SAVE IT!

You'll need it for the quest "Soothing Turtle Bisque" in Hillsbrad. (Alli: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=555 -- Horde: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7321) | Subject: "Easy and Quick Way To Get Your Shells!!!"
Soloed at lvl 32, NE Rogue. Easy quest. Here's how I did it.

Headed directly north from the Raceway HQ till I saw a boat half buried in the sand. You can't miss it either. Besides the fact that there were about 17-18 Snappers bumbling around it, it's a large object as well! Best of all though, there are no baddies in the area the Snappers are in, they're just hanging around outside where the Snappers are. The drop ratio I seemed to have here was actually about 45-55% and they also dropped some nice items for the AH, even got one blue letter sword!

The coords for the ship, if you're using Cosmos(which if you're not you need to!), are: X82, Y55. These are the exact coords while standing under the prow of the ship.

I also found one other place that seems to be pretty decent though I was done when I found it. On the eastern wall of the shimmering flats, about halfway up is a rocket car(otherwise known as a Pod Racer for the SW geeks) embedded about halfway up the wall.

To get here, head directly east of the Raceway HQ.

The coords are: X86, Y76. In front of that is a pretty decent grouping of snappers, but they are mingled with Saltstone Crystalhides and Scorpid Terrors so look out!

I decided to post this as allot of people in my guild that are at the point of doing this quest have been asking me how I did it. This has seemed to work out well for all of them, so I hope this helps anyone reading this! | Huge cluster of turtles at 82,54 around the ship. | Subject: "Experience"
