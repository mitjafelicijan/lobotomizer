Fly to Sun Rock Retreat, walk east to path, south until there is a fork that heads north-east and take it to Windshear Crag. There is a lake with a tail that winds south, the Sky Port is just south of the main body of the lake. Don't expect a runway and traditional airport, it's a tower. | You don't need to get to the top, just standing next to it worked for me, the easiest way is through the lake, i didn't aggro a single mob
