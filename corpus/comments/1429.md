I was lazy and didn't bother trying to fight my way in, so I just mounted up and rode around to the temples, looking for the elusive gold disc on the mini-map. Found it, got to the troll, handed it in, and died. I'm gonna say it was worth it.

Edit: At one point this comment was scored 1000, although I have no idea how or why. How many internets have I won? | Subject: "<Blank>"
ok exact place 34, 75 | The exile is found in Shadra'Alor in the Hinterlands. From the entrance to this area, run straight ahead to the temple in the southwest. Be prepared to kill 3-4 spiders and 4-5 trolls. Also be prepared to dodge Shadra, the level 55 elite spider.

You will need to go near the top of the temple (noted above) then drop down to the left before you reach the top. If you stick to the left side of the stairs, you should be able to see the exile (and his glowing yellow question mark). | You can get to the exile without going up the temple. after you pass the lake head to the west zone wall. run up the wall (it will take a few jumps) and you can drop down right on the platform he is standing. This is more difficult then Ormriss's description but it will require less fighting. | He's at 33.8,75.2. | Subject: "<Blank>"
