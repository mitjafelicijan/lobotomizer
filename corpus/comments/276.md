# Two large camps can be found around 60,71 | Subject: "by Dave4468, 2.7 months ago i found a lot near 58,51 -great location"
yea great location for you if you plan on staying at the location for 100 years

most of them are fenrunners.. and only 4-5 mongrels

the camp is at 63,63 they are mongrel's and
gnolls

on that location be sure to eliminate the ones who are spaced further away from the tents and have a buddy with you if youre only lvl 20 on this. cause they attack all of them at once if you arent carefull and tahts 6 mosshides plus the ones you dont clear on the outside of camp | Subject: "Real TLOC"
I found 2 rather large camps at 61, 71.
