# Talked to a few people on my server, seems it easily drops from the higher level naga. I made one pass around that fountain thing in the middle, killed about 7 and it dropped. | The drop rate is not great, the quest can take a little longer than you would expect (it took me about 25 minutes of killing).

Based on the Wowhead drop data and the comments I tried both beach and up in the ruins, it finally dropped off of a Myrmidon on the beach. Many of the mobs in the ruins themselves do NOT drop it, so the beach might be a little better. Only kill Myrmidons and Sirens, which the beach is crawling with. | Grind for this down on the beach, the serpent guards in the ruins do not drop the item! | Subject: "<Blank>"
For those who don't know (and I didn't), Kim'Jael is on top of the mountain at 53,21 location. You have to go to the North side of the mountain and then head South up the mountain. He there by himself. | Subject: "prolly was fixed"
"some rune", i think "some guy" at blizzard got lazy with coming up with names :P.  This item dropped in about 15 mins for me.  I'd say they likely fixed the drop rate judging from previous posts.  Remember its myr's and sirens only. | Subject: "drop rate"
got it on the third kill
