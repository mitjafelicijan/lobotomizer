Is it that hard? I just completed it at lv38 alone. First I looked around the vicinity for any mob and took out a spider and raptor.

I had VW out to tank the demon, but big blue couldn't hold aggro for more than 30 sec, so I sacrificed him for shield and nuked all out. When the shield drops, it was Fear time. Keep the demon feared and don't stop shadowbolting it; always refresh your DoTs and Fear when they wear off.

The demon hit me for 80-130, but I have 2,100 HP with all +stamina gears, so I could take lots of beatings. In the end I came out with 70% life, almost depleted mana, and about 50 secs left.

Not hard at all... if you know your warlock spells and use them properly. =) | Subject: "Forget the rest listen to the ....."
Talk to Tabetha (46,57) and she will take you outside.

Set your Void to aggresive

Curse him
(i used curse of Agony, corruption and immolate)

fear him

shadowbold him

do this over and over again and ofcourse within the given 2,5 min

did this at level 38.
no pots... i am not a good player but this is pretty easy to do solo. Did not use bandage or stone.
