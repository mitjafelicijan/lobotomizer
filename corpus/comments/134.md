The Ogre Mound area (I'm not sure why it's called a mound because they're all down in a vale) can be entered and exited from the West end near Addle's Stead, and this is very close to the cave entrance where the crate is. Enter from the West end and follow the wall to the right until you see the cave and the crate. Only needed to kill two ogres, very easy. ^_^ | Subject: "Crate location"
The crate is near the mine entrance, to the right of the tunnel and behind the log. | Abercrombie's Crate
