Burned out House is at Alexston Farmstead.  It is on the west side of the zone, directly above Moonbrooke on the map.  This is for those of you like me who don't use coordinates.

Enjoy. | Coordinates 36,54 | The compass is found inside a small chest located in a small house on Alexston Farmstead, Westfall.
