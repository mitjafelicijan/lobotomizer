The quest is a reference to Ultima Online. If you died in that MMORPG, you turned into a ghost -- whatever you typed in ghost form, came out as "OooOoo ooOoo Oooo".Â  Napa Valley was/is an UO shard (realm), and the Knights of Chaos are/were a guild on there. One of the programmers or quest designers apparently was in that guild. :) Nice gimmick.
