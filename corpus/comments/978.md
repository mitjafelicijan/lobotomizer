just like the feathers from hinterlands, the moontouched feathers arent dropped but rather found on the ground | I found the feathers near Timbermaw Post around 45,43 | Subject: "Location and spawning"
I have theory about how these feathers spawn.  On the road at 64,53 there are 4 spawn points around the road at about:

65,54
65,52
63,54
66,53

There is ONE feather that will spawn at one of these four locations.  I just rode around the area, found one, looted it, and sure enough withing a minute or so, it would spawn at another one of the locations.    I did my entire quest in this one area.  I never saw more than one feather at a time, and it was never in the same place twice in a row, but of course that may have just been a statistical anomaly.  There are other feathers around Winterspring of course, and I am betting they all work the same way. | Subject: "feather locations..."
Found most of my feathers a little east and west of the timbermaw post, got some up near frostsaber rock though. Best place for these is at the post:

58,27
58,20
44,42
43,42
43,41
43,44
38,43
38,45
37,44
37,42

Turn this in to the guy on the lower level of the only building in rut'theran village (near darnassus flight path) for 4g 24s. | Subject: "More locations"

44,44 big patch of feathers. | Subject: "yes - easy"
as above, 44,44 - 10 feathers, 5 min, bit of XP from a couple of mobs, skin a bit, np. | They are light blue feathers. Just like the ones in the Hinterlands, they are on the ground. I found a lot near the lake.
