I don't think it needs 13 plus, as I've never had any difficulty with Plainstriders. However, whatever you think about that, this quest is worth it, even if the drop rate's a little low. I did it while I was doing other things; I tend to kill any available enemies anyway as I'm a skinner/leatherworker and find it useful.

I find it's worth it for the nice quests it leads into; they're mostly simple killing, which I find is much like grinding with an eventual reward. Nice, in my opinion; I'd be killing these things just to up my level whether I was questing or not. Heaven knows why so many people complain about these quests, as they're intended to make grinding less boring rather than give massive rewards.
