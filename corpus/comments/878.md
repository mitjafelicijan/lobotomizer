water seeker - near | To save some time, this quest can easily be done with "Consumed By Hatred" (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=899), as the mobs for this quest drop the quest items for "Consumed By Hatred". | Turning in this quest leads to https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5052, where you turn in the Blood Shards you found. First you turn in one, and then you can turn in blood shards for nice buffs. All the quests can be found if you look up Blood Shards (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=5075#M0zc).
The buffs you get are great for grinding, and most of them last 30 minutes.
Turning in the first Blood Shard also leads to Betrayal from Within(https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=879). | Subject: "Thornweavers and Geomancers"
