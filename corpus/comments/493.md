Only a couple of mages along the way.  Becareful of the other monsters on this route and make sure that if you have a pet/summon creature that you have it set to "passive" so you don't agro anything. | Subject: "Getting there is a journey"
There will be a pair of lvl 20 or 21 mages at the other side of ambermill which will put you away in a hurry if you're solo.  There will also be an attack by a lvl 24 Starving Mountain Lion as you approach Tarren Mill.  These were the only things that couldn't be avoided.
