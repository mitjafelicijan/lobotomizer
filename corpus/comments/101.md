ghoul claw from flesh eater, and bone chewer.
Vial from pygmyspider
skeleton fingers from skeletal fiend, horror, healer.

All in raven hills | Ghoul Fangs can be gotten easier from the ones in the Raven Hill Cemetery (around 20,36). They're only L24-25 there as opposed to L28-29 at Mistmantle (77,36). | Fingers: 81,59 off of the Skeletons
Fangs: 77,36 off of the Ghouls
Vials: Found on spiders along the coasts and pretty much all over.

The reward is pretty fun for a warlock, mage, or priest. It's not the best but if you're grinding it may entertain you a little bit.

- SJ | Ghoul fangs have a low drop rate, so you will be killing for a while. | Subject: "LOCATION"

Ghouls are 25,34
