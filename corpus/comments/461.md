# Quest URL: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=461
# You'll need to enter the keep on Fenris Isle and get to the roof. Enter through the entrance and take the following path: left->right->right->go up the stairs->left->left->go up the stairs. If you die making your way up, head right to the roof before ressing and you can bypass the gnolls. Once you reach the roof, cross it and it's in the tower - hovering your mouse over the towers on the roof will light up "Dusty Shelf". | Subject: "Piece of cake"
Just let yourself die next to the base of the south west tower - can be outside, no problem. Then - as a ghost, go upstairs untill you find the niche (three shelves). Get in to the rooftop between the two towers (the south west and south east) and - on the farthest corner, where the guards do not spot you - get ressurrected. Then - it�s easy - just get the first guard, get the second and go for the shelves. The quest it�s yours! | Subject: "Tough to find but possible."
The shelf is hard to find but with a little exploration it is possible. Enter the keep and fight your way to the back where the stairs lead up to the second floor. Turn left immediately after going up the stairs, go the the hallway in front of you, kill any mobs near you, and turn left again. In front of you should be a doorway with maybe one or two mobs in there as well. Kill the mobs and enter the room. You are now in the North East tower. There should be a set of stairs in the room follow them up to the top killing any mobs you come in contact with. When the stairs end exit the tower through the doorway and you will now be on the roof. Cross the roof to the other side (west) and kill any mobs near the enterance to the South West tower. Enter the tower through the doorway, again killing any mobs, and directly to the left of the doorway (as you enter it) is the dusty shelf. Like I said kinda tricky but with some exploration you can do it.
