Re: Above comment by me.

So I redid this as a lvl42.

To get another power source, after wasting the first one, I had to go out and collect ten water pouches.

After 1 hour and 15 minutes hunting between Gadgetzan and Steamwheedle Port I had 8 acceptable hyena and scorpid samples, but only 2 basilisk samples. To finish the basi samples I went Southwest out of Gadgetzan, only a little ways and killed several. I had all samples by 1h 45m.

I'm no fan of low drop rate collection quests, but they seem to pay a lot. When I turned in the power source in Gadgetzan, I received 4050 xp. When I turned in the kit in the Apothecarium in the Undercity, I recieved 5050 xp, 1g 30s, and an item which sold to the vendor for 65s 10c.

That's 9100 xp and almost 2g all totalled.

Almost makes me feel guilty for whining.

Almost.
