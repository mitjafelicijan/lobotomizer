The weapons are held on weapon racks in the crypt in the mills, very northern section with zombies and banshees.  In the very bottom room there is a weapon rack, in the 2 rooms up the stairs from the bottom is another 2 racks, and in the room above that is another.

The rewards are warrior-only weapons, 7.6 DPS 1h dagger/sword/mace/axe. | Subject: "Get a group"
The mobs in the crypt come in threes when you pull them.  You'll probably want a group or wait for higher level to complete this quest.

Edit:  You may also want to wait for "The Family Crypt" quest - part of a chain and knock out both at the same time.
