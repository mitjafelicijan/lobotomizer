# Don't use the weapon, i just found out the fallen hero of the horde has an option to give u a Fel Salve in case you destroy your weapons. I didn't destroy my weapon, but he gave me the fel salve anyways, and its better than the weapons! read on

"this item is better than the weapons we get for this quest. It doesn't have an equip cooldown, where u have to wait 30 seconds after equipping it before you can use it. it also doesn't have a 10 minute cooldown like the weapons do once used! so u can use this more than once in a single fight, which they don't let you do with the weapon, and since the debuff doesn't last very long, its a lot more useful than the damn weapons. now u can use your regular weapon and not take a hit to your stats, and get extra debuff. I don't know why everyone doesn't think of this! get it by talking to the fallen hero of the horde, once u have gotten the weapon. he has an option where u can tell him you destroyed your Azsharite weapon, and hell give you this potion | Subject: "Top Tip"
Don't destroy your felbane weapon after you finish the whole quest chain - it sells for over 5g to vendors.
