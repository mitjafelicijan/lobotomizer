52,46 is the correct location. | You need Sunscale Feathers in order to touch the nests. These are dropped by Sunscale Scytheclaws (raptors) that are around the nest area. | For those of you using TomTom, for those who aren't this provides more exact coordinates

/way 52.03 46.48 Yellow Nest | Subject: "Coordinates"
Coordinates at like 52,46. Head south from Crossroads and you'll notice a mound off the left of the road before you reach the bridge. The eggs are around that mound. | Subject: "lost in battle"
if oyur doing the lost in battle quest where you need to find the remains. Head south from xroads until you see a bridge, when your at the bridge the remains are in a hut that you can see to your right, if you look behind you and to the left you will see the nests. All you do is put a feather into the nest and your done, they are all right next to each other and were being gaurded by about 6 raptors at the time. piece-o-cake. | Subject: "be careful of centaur"
Centaur path through this area, so keep an eye out. If you're soloing two scytheclaws at once a centaur party pathing through your fight can really tip the balance fast.
