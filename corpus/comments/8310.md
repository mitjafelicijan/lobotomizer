# Subject: "Silithid Hive Brains"
Regarding the Silithid Hive Brains that drop for this quest; They will not drop straight away most of the time. It will take 5-15 kills approximately, such is the nature of the dreaded random drop. So its better to do this in a sturdy group of 2 or 3, Idealy while doing Glyph Chasing and Into The Maw of Madness. The Brains being a white (Standard Quality) Quest Item everyone in your group will get to loot it.

The Silithid Mobs are tough, but like mentioned above they are not quite as strong as normal 58-60 elites thus apparantly making them soloable for some people although I have not tried this myself as a 60 Orc Warrior.

Thnx for reading my comment and i hope it helped.

Any of the elite mobs in the three hives will drop brains.  The non elite wasps in Hive'zora will drop these too, but at a rate about 1/2 to 1/3 of the elites.  Easily soloable by a rogue, just ambush, gouge, backstab, pop evasion, and then gouge, backstab, and evicerate your way to victory.  The easiest mobs to go after are the Hive'ashi Stingers, Hive'zora Waywatchers, and the Hive'Regal Slavemakers or Spitfires.  They have a few long spells they try to cast so be sure to kick or gouge them before they can get them off.  Use dual instant poison and be prepared to blind them.
