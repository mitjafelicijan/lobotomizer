Bone Fragments are used for a quest in EPL called "Bonescythe Digs". After you collected 30 Bone Fragments you turn them in for a Insignia of the Crusade.

The Bone Fragments drops off Undeads in Scholomance, Stratholme and all over WPL/EPL.

The quest itself requires Friendly reputation with Argent Dawn to get. | Subject: "Bone drops"
These drop of SKELETON type undead only - Not off spectres/horrors/flayers and the like.

A good place to farm for them is Andoral in WPL, since there is a large number of lower lvl skeletons there, which respawn quite quickly.

Oh, and the semi bosses (55-56 elite) that appear inside the towers in Andoral will drop 2-3 bone fragments each.

I am yet to find out if this quest is repeatable...

... but will know soon. | Subject: "Requirements"

You must meet BOTH qualifiers to get this quest and the others like it.
