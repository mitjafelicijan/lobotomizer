# Quest Title: Confront Yeh'kinya

# This is part of a long chain quest designed to familiarize you with Zul'Gurub and the Zandalar Tribe. Much of the rewards are decent for their level. The Faded Hakkari Cloak is only slightly worse than everyone's favorite Hide of the Wild. Definitely a worthwhile chain for someone that doesn't want to shell out for the Hide.

Here's the full quest chain:
- Screecher Spirits(Feralas) - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3520
- The Prophecy of Mosh'aru(Zul'Farrak) - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3527
- The Ancient Egg(Hinterlands) - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4787
- The God Hakkar(Temple of Atal'Hakkar) - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=3528
- The Lost Tablets of Mosh'aru(Eastern Plaguelands) - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=5065
- The Final Tablets(Lower Blackrock Spire) - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=4788
- Confront Yeh'kinya(Tanaris) - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8181
- The Hand of Rastakhan(Stranglethorn Vale) - https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8182

Yeah, it sucks, you have to do these quests first:

Screecher Spirits
The Prophecy of Mosh'aru
The Ancient Egg
The God Hakkar
The Lost Tablets of Mosh'aru

After that, talk to Ironwhatever in Tanaris and get the quest "Confront Yeh'kinya", talk to Yeh'whatever and get the cloak.
