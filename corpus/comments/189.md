You would THINK that each troll has 2 ears... but NOOOOO... most don't have ears, go figure. | Subject: "Experience"

The Camp is around 36,11 and the trolls spawn quickly at Tkashi Ruins at around 34,15 - about 1 minute away.  I was getting about 1 drop per 4 kills, so not too bad. Took me less than 30mins to get all 15 drops.  If you're soloing at around the same or lower lvl as the trolls, best not to go into the centre of the ruins as you'll agro all the Shaman trolls. Just keep doing circuits around the outside and you'll find they spawn ready for you, and you can take em out one at a time.  They also drop a lot of silk. | Subject: "Bloodscalp Ears Review"
