loc. 13.34 | Subject: "Barrel location"
Took me a bit of searching to find the last barrel - the Half-Buried Barrel is at 13,34 - due north of the 2nd camp.

The camp is before you reach the ruined ships.

When heading north, the Half-Buried Barrel is next to the stilt of the eastern most hut.

You will recognize the camp because of a semicircular "barrel" in the ground. That's not what you click.

What you are looking for is actually a small cask.
