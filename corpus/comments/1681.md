# Subject: "coord"
You find the ore in a lockbox at 78,62 in Ironband's Compound (south of Helm's Bed Lake) in the house in the back in the basement. The box is protected by Captain Beld, lvl 11 non-elite. The other mobs around are lvl 8 to 9. | Just as the quest details, Ironband's Compound is just southwest of Helm's Bed Lake, which is on the Eastern side of Dun Morogh.

When you approach the compound, you'll notice a building on the south side. this is where the Umbral Ore is located. Dark Iron Spies are spaced wide enough apart that you can pull each one individually.

After making your way inside of the building, you'll find Captain Beld located in the basement. He is standing right next to a chest that contains the Umbral Ore. Beware, as soon as he sees you, he will charge you, so any rush attacks will have to be quick. Once Captain Beld is killed, simply open the chest and retreive the ore.

For those of you with Cosmos or Titan Panel add-ons, the coordinates are 77,62 for the chest.

Note: The quest "The Public Servant" pairs will with this quest, since Rockjaw Bonesnappers are also found in front of the compound. (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=433) | Subject: "rewards"
