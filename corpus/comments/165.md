for those without coordinates, he is in just north and a little east of the raven hill cemetery. | The NPC your looking for is called Abercrombie located @ 28,31 in Duskwood | Make sure not to pick up any quests from Abercrombie prior to this. It seems like when you do so, this quest becomes obsolete.

I've tested this on an alt, picked up the quest and tried to share it with someone who also wasn't able to pick it up anymore. It said the person had completed it, but the script below said it was false.

/script print(IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(165))
This situation is kinda similar to the quest  The Temple of the Moon in Darnassus
