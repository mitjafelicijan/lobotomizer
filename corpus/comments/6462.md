# Subject: "Entrance to the hold"
The entrance to the hold is located at 38, 30
The enemies inside aren't much ahrder than on the outside, in Thistlefur Village but the big difference is that u often have to take on two at once. If not 3.

Chests look likr this | Careful in this cave, things respawn very quickly. Watch your back as you progress through it or you'll end up with respawned adds easily. The troll chests respawn quickly as well though, so you can circle around one room and finish the quest pretty quickly. | Subject: "Easy"
Everything respawns really quickly so stay in the same area and you'll be done in no time. I stayed in the area where you pick up the escort quest and I was done in 5 minutes. | Subject: "info"
You can do this one at the same time as the "Between a rock and a Thistlefur" quest. As you kill all the Thistlefus you can work your way up the to the Thistlefur city. Once in the gate fight your way to the top and take notice of a arched area. Head up there for the cave entrance. Inside the cave you should work your way toward the back. While doing so you'll see the chests for this quest.
