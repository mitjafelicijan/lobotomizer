Why are you people confusing everyone? Coordinates for Warug are 75,68. I fyou don't know what you're talking about, please don't post! | Subject: "These quests are pointless..."
Both magram and gelkis suck, so just do the gelkis alliance.Thats why:
1.Gelkis have better rewards.
2.They have more sensible quests, as uthek is aiding her tribe while warug is just plain stupid and mean.
3.Magram are actually easier to kill.Just watch for the pack runners.
4.Gelkis chests in their caves you can loot when you are friendly with them.

All in all, centaurs suck. | Subject: "And My Alliance With You Ends Here..."
    ...Really. Warug asks for some stupid thing only skilled Engineers can make. I got mine by spamming the Trade Chat, and when I saw that after giving him the damned thing, he wanted me to kill some Khan, I just stopped. Sure I dd the next one but geez, what a lazy bum :D.
    If you want to stop here in this chain, it would be sensible. However, after leaving the Magram I saw that I had to go to STV. I didn't want to, so I clicked 'At War' on the Magram Rep Bar and turned around and started killing them.
    I highly reccomend stopping here and turning traitor to helping the Gelkis. Take the Nijel's quest and the Gelkis quest chain, and you got yourself a good two more levels out of Desolace. | Subject: "Re: Gizmo for Warug [1371]"
I'm happy to make these for people at no charge, providing they send the mats.

I play on Dunemaul as Gringel (alliance).

The mats list, for reference, are as follows:

four heavy leather
three iron bars
two bronze bars
one gold bar
one medium leather
one wool cloth
