29,58 young nightwebs
26,60 nightwebs and entrace to cave | Subject: "Night Web Spiders"
Young Night Web Spiders are mostly located outside the Hollow and are pretty easy to kill alone at level 3-4. Even easier with an imp. They all agro.

However, if someone trains the higher level Night Web Spiders on you -- instant death. So take a friend, or fiend ;) | Subject: "Only finding young night web spiders?"
Guys the answer is simple. first find the young ones (sort of tan coloured.) these are passive creatures, attacking u only when attacked. these r east of where ppl usually go to to get the scavenger paws and duskbat wings. then go up. you shud find a cave or mine. (its a mine with traintracks in it)there are bigger, black spiders with red patterns on. these r night web spiders. there maybe 1 or 2 outside the mine, but most are found inside | Subject: "Crowded cave"
Even with the insane number of people in this cave during the stress test, it was a blast. Beat the heck out of the "kill this" quests in EQ (of which I've done HUNDREDS!). Just felt more satisfying. | Subject: "Location"
they are located around 30,56 in deathknell
