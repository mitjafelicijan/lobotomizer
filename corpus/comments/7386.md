# Subject: "Woodlord Bossmob"
With enough crystals the bossmob of the Alliance can be summoned which is almost certainly a turning of the tide for the Alliance.

We certainly turned in at least 10 times and the quest giver still said he needs more, so I dont know exactly how many it takes to call the boss.
