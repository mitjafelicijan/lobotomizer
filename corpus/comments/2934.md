# Subject: "Note"
Take note: The venom sac dissapears after about a half hour. | Subject: "Location"
  I took the bird from TM to Revantusk Village.  The location of the spiders is 35,64 in the Hinterlands.  I killed 12 got the sac finally, went back to Revantusk Village and took the bird to TM.  Very easy quest, I'm a 46 Hunter, did it solo | When this item drops -ALL- party members are able to loot it at the same time. Also, this isn't a 100% drop. We found one after our third spider. | Subject: "Sanity..."
The drop rate is currently at 0.8%.  I got it on my third spider but think...

The drop rate is for ALL people killing these things.  A lot of people arent actually on this quest so it wont drop for them.  The drop rate is skewed and shouldnt really be used as a true judge here. | Picked it up at 34, 73 on my 5th kill.
BTW, these spiders have 2 little punks inside of them that attack after you kill. 1 hit kills on those fellas as a 48 warrior. | Subject: "Drop Rate Sucks"
I killed almost every spider (and their spawned offspring) in the walled area around the pyramids for nearly two hours and received no drop of this quest item.  This stupid quest sucks because the drop rate is so bad.  I did manage to harvest some Sungrass on my way, though.  But seeing other player posts stating they got it from the first spider really has me ticked. (solo level 47 mage).
