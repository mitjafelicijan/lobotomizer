This is easy.  When you get to the gate, eat the apple, then ride straight in and hand in the quest.  Its the big building straight ahead.

One thing to watch out for: I tried to pick up some herb while there and when I looted the apple disguise immediately came off and I was attacked.  Easy enough to eat the apple again and they left me alone.

Have fun!
