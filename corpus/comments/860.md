im undead ..... i went to do all the quests in barens .... and wanted this path cause i know its good ... and melor wouldnt give me the first step in it .... apparently you need to do The Hunter's Way(https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=861/the-hunters-way) first to be able to pick this up .... as undead you dont hit it because you dont go through malgore at a low lvl ... just thought ppl might like to know
