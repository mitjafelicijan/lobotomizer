(You do also get rep with the timbermaw's) | Subject: "<Blank>"
30,35 is definitely the best area.  There simply aren't a lot of totemics.  They respawn quickly, though. | Subject: "Take both quests and goto...!"
Take both the "Threat of the Winterfall" and "Witnterfall Activity" quests and go first to 31,36 to kill Pathfinders, Totemics and Den Watchers (both quests need den watchers so you only have to kill 8 instead of 16 if you get both quests as I said;)).

I did this with a lvl 54 hunter so I had to wait for 2 more lvls to kill the shamans and ursa's... | Subject: "good spot"
40,43 is a good spot for all of these. fast respawn rates also. it's in timbermaw post which is off the road, south and a bit east of donova snowden. fast respawns too. | Just make sure you have the quest: https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=6241 at the same time. It will at least save you from killing 8 mobs.
