This quest was very easy as a 54 mage. All that is needed is Fire Ward up and spam frostbolt on them. I completed the quest with very little damage taken. It could probably be done with the same technique by a 51 mage although there might be a lot of resists from the 55's. | Subject: "Correct Faction"
I play as a Horde and got this quest yesterday from Liv in Ratchet... so it is actually neutral quest and not Alliance only. | Subject: "found"

I was able to attain this quest at Level 50 by having it shared with me by a Level 49, so the minimum level is at least that low. | Subject: "Liv Rizzlefix in Ratchet"
