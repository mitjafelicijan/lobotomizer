# The location stated above is not right. You have to move a little forward and kill the mobs because you have to take the stairs. And THERE is the Translocation Orb that will take you to the first Power Source to deactivate. Location for that Translocation Orb is 68:51 ( I am standing on it).

Once you got translocated, you kill the mobs around the First Power of Source; then you climb the stairs to the Second One and once more up the stairs for the Third and last one. Then you take the Translocation Orb behind the Third Power Source and that will take you back to the first Translocation Orb.

(The Translocation Orb stated above (55:44) is located in Silvermoon City and will take you to Undercity.)
