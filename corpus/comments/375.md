just did this last night -

Coarse thread can be bought from the Trade Vendor at the wagon in Brill, close to the tavern/inn.

As for the bats, Vampiric are around lvl. 9, and red (hostile), so I recc you hunt the other (yellow) ones all around Brill - lower level, fater kills = faster completion. | Subject: "pelts"
it took me bout 1015 kills to get the pelts
