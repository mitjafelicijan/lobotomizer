* [The Lost Dwarves](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman/the-lost-dwarves) (Horde only)
* [Revelosh](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman/revelosh)
* [Ironaya](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman/ironaya)
* [Obsidian Sentinel](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman/obsidian-sentinel)
* [Ancient Stone Keeper](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman/ancient-stone-keeper)
* [Galgann Firehammer](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman/galgann-firehammer)
* [Grimlok](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman/grimlok)
* [Archaedas](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman/archaedas)

### [The Lost Dwarves](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman/the-lost-dwarves) (Horde only)

This first encounter in Uldaman is only available to Horde, as the three dwarves, Baelog (41+), Eric “The Swift” (40+), and Olaf (40+), are friendly to Alliance players. Each of the Lost Dwarves has a special ability: Baelog’s ranged attack, Eric’s Rushing Charge, and Olaf’s Shield Slam. Behind the three Lost Dwarves, loot the chest to receive the Gni’kiv Medallion which you will need to summon Ironaya.

[![the lost dwarves](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/The-Lost-Dwarves.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/The-Lost-Dwarves.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** The tank should focus on picking up Olaf, so that he is only casting [Rushing Charge](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/6268) on the tank. Initially the tank should also try to get threat on Eric to avoid the Healer and DPS taking unnecessary damage or being the target of [Rushing Charge](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/6268).
* **Healer:** The healer in this encounter should be maintaining maximum range and trying maintain healing spells on the tank and the DPS. Because of the likelihood of the healer and DPS being targeted by [Rushing Charge](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/6268), using bubbles and stacking HoTs on all party members is encouraged.
* **Damage Dealers:** In this fight, DPS need to focus down Eric, as the Tank will not be able to maintain threat through casts of [Rushing Charge](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/6268). DPS classes should cast crowd control spells to handle Baelog. Kill order is typically Eric, Olaf, then Baelog.

#### Loot

* [Baelog’s Shortbow](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9400)
* [Battered Viking Shield](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9403)
* [Horned Viking Helmet](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9394)
* [Nordic Longshank](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9401)
* [Olaf’s All Purpose Shield](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9404)
* [Worn Running Boots](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9398)

### [Revelosh](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman/revelosh)

[![revelosh](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Revelosh.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Revelosh.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Generate initial threat on Revelosh and the adds. If possible, interrupt the [Chain Lightning](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/16006) spell while it is being cast.
* **Healer:** Healers in this fight should maintain max range, and spread out to avoid [Chain Lightning](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/16006).
* **Damage Dealers:** The priority in this fight is to kill Revelosh as fast as possible to avoid taking damage from [Chain Lightning](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/16006). Use any interrupt abilities to kick his [Chain Lightning](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/16006) casts. Focus down any non-elite adds before damaging Revelosh.

#### Loot

* [Revelosh’s Boots](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9387)
* [Revelosh’s Gloves](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9390)
* [Revelosh’s Spaulders](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9389)

### [Ironaya](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman/ironaya)

Before the encounter, one player will need to combine The Shaft of Tsol with the Gni’kiv Medallion, both looted from the previous bosses. Ironaya is hard to kill – with high armor, a lot of hit points, immunity to damage over time effects (DoTs) and a knock back ability. Beyond these factors, the fight is a straightforward tank and spank.

[![ironaya](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ironaya.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ironaya.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** The Tank simply needs to pick up Ironaya and face her away from DPS and the Healer to avoid [Arcing Smash](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8374).
* **Healer:** The healer in this fight should only need to focus on keeping up the tank, as DPS shouldn’t be taking much damage if they are positioned well. Spread out with ranged DPS and focus your healing on the tank.
* **Damage Dealers:** Ranged DPS should spread out behind the boss and focus on damage dealing spells. Avoid the use of damage over time effects, as Ironaya is immune to them. Melee need to also spread out as best they can while still avoiding [Arcing Smash](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8374).

#### Loot

* [Ironaya’s Bracers](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9409)
* [Ironshod Bludgeon](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9408)
* [Stoneweaver Leggings](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9407)

### [Obsidian Sentinel](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman/obsidian-sentinel)

Obsidian Sentinel is essentially the boss version of the Stone Steward mobs with higher armor, hit points, and damage over time (DoT) effect immunity. At 66% and 33%, Obsidian Sentinel will spawn two smaller, non elite Obsidian Shard.

[![obsidian sentinel](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Obsidian-Sentinel.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Obsidian-Sentinel.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** In this fight, the tank only needs to take the boss and face him away from the group to allow melee to attack from behind. Pick up adds as they spawn. Do your best to maintain threat on the adds when they spawn as well.
* **Healer:** The healer in this fight should simply remain away from the other members of the group and keep heals up on the tank.
* **Damage Dealers:** Obsidian Sential has a lot of health, and DPS should focus on the boss when no adds are present. When he summons Obsidian Shards, DPS should focus them down first then return to the boss. Give your tank a few moments to generate threat on the adds before attacking them.

#### Loot

* None

### [Ancient Stone Keeper](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman/ancient-stone-keeper)

Ancient Sone Keeper is similar to the other stone mobs in the instance, with high health, armor, and immunity to DoT effects. This boss also has a notable Sand Storms ability, which is an AoE slow and silence.

[![ancient stone keeper](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ancient-Stone-Keeper.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ancient-Stone-Keeper.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Tanking this fight is straightforward: simply maintain threat.
* **Healer:** Stay at max range to avoid the silence effect of [Sand Storms](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/10132) and focus healing on the tank during this fight.
* **Damage Dealers:** Ranged DPS need to stay at max range in order to avoid being affected by the silence component of [Sand Storms](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/10132).

#### Loot

* [Cragfists](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9410)
* [Rockshard Pauldrons](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9411)

### [Galgann Firehammer](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman/galgann-firehammer)

This boss is a Fire casting Dark Iron Dwarf accompanied by two Shadowforge Geologist as adds. This boss is the first in the instance to indicate any potential association of the Dark Iron Dwarves with Ragnaros.

[![galgann firehammer](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Galgann-Firehammer.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Galgann-Firehammer.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Tanking this fight will be significantly easier if another group member besides the primary tank can pick up one of the Shadowforge Geologists. The Main Tank should separate Galgann from the rest of the group and tank him facing away from the group. Pop any defensive cooldowns early if the healer is having a hard time keeping both tanking players alive.
* **Healer:** This fight will be healer intensive, as there is a lot of AoE damage, and [Amplify Flames](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/9482) increases the need for healing spells throughout the fight. The healer will also need to focus keeping up both of the players tanking during the fight. Use bubbles and heal over time effects to aid you in alternating between targets. Dispell [Amplify Flames](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/9482) if possible.
* **Damage Dealers:** The adds should be the primary targets of the DPS in this fight, then switching to Galgann after they are both down. One of the DPS classes should tank one Shadowforge Geologist away from Galgann.

#### Loot

* [Emberscale Cape](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/11311)
* [Flameseet Mantle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/11310)
* [Galgann’s Fireblaster](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9412)
* [Galgann’s Firehammer](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9419)

### [Grimlok](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman/grimlok)

Grimlok is another trogg boss in Uldaman, and he is accompanied by a Stonevault Geomancer, Stonevault Brawler, and Jadespine Basilisk. The basic strategy is to focus down Grimlok while the other adds are CC’d. If your group does not have three CC’s available, focus down the Basilisk first.

[![grimlok](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Grimlok.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Grimlok.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** The tank should pick up Grimlok and any other loose mobs, and tank them against a nearby wall.
* **Healer:** The Healer in this fight should focus on their positioning to avoid being stunned by the basilisk or attracting any threat from the other mobs in the fight. The main focus will be on keeping up the Tank who is handling the Basilisk and Grimlok, making sure that any damage done to DPS members and yourself from the adds or AoE effects is also covered.
* **Damage Dealers:** Work together with the other DPS in the group to CC as many mobs as possible. Burn Grimlock as quick as you can.

#### Loot

* [Grimlock’s Charge](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9416)
* [Grimlok’s Tribal Vestments](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9415)
* [Oilskin Leggings](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9414)

### [Archaedas](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/uldaman/archaedas)

The final boss of Uldaman is Archaedas, a level 47+ giant. The boss has Ground Tremor ability, which stuns nearby enemies. Archaedas also summons a lot of non-elite adds. Because of the adds which are summoned from the room the boss is found in, many groups will choose to kite the boss on pull all the way up the ramps to the previous large, circular room with columns to down Archaedas. The boss will continue to summon non-elite Earthern Guardians and Vault Warder adds during the fight. At 20% health, Archaedas will spawn 4 elite adds who also die when the boss does. Groups who have the DPS and can handle the adds well enough should focus on downing the boss while other groups may opt to kill one or two adds before focusing down the boss.

[![archaedas](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Archaedas.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Archaedas.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Tanking this fight begins with a ranged pull and generating initial threat on the boss, then kiting him up to the previous chamber for the fight. Keep the boss away form the group to help mitigating the effects of [Ground Tremor](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/6524). You will also need to focus on picking up adds as they spawn. Focus on protecting your healer, as DPS can kite and burn down adds that are causing them issues.
* **Healer:** All of the players in this encounter are likely going to take some damage, so be prepared to conserve mana using cool downs and potions. Protect your DPS classes as they are the ones keeping the adds from being directed towards you in this encounter. The tank will be your focus as Archaedas hits decently hard, but his swing timer is long. Spread out from the boss to avoid [Ground Tremor](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/6524).
* **Damage Dealers:** Archaedas has a lot of health, and the fight is going to be long relative to the other encounters in Uldaman. Use cooldowns, potions, bandages, and other abilities to help get through the fight successfully. When possible, spread out from the boss to avoid [Ground Tremor](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/6524). During the fight, prioritize the adds that spawn. Be sure to give your tank a few seconds to generate threat on the adds before damaging them. Only when all the adds are dead should you damage the boss.

#### Loot

* [Archaedic Stone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/11118)
* [Stoneslayer](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9418)
* [The Rockpounder](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9413)
