Scarlet Monastery was originally used for priests in Lordaeron, but became the home of the Scarlet Crusade when the undead rose. The Scarlet Crusade fiercely hates any race that is not human, as you’ll find almost exclusively humans throughout the monastery. It is split into four wings, each containing several enemies and bosses. The cathedral is the most impressive landmark of the monastery. Within are Scarlet Commander Mograine and High Inquisitor Whitemane.

* **Level Requirement**: 21
* **Recommended Level**: 35-45
* **Location**: Tirisfal Glades
* **Boss Encounters:** [High Inquisitor Fairbanks](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scarlet-monastery-cathedral/high-inquisitor-fairbanks), [Scarlet Commander Mograine & High Inquisitor Whitemane](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scarlet-monastery-cathedral/scarlet-commander-mograine-and-high-inquisitor-whitemane)
* **Loot Drops:** *[Scarlet Leggings](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10330), [Aegis of the Scarlet Commander](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7726), [Hand of Righteousness](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7721), [Triune Amulet](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7722), [Whitemane’s Chapeau](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7720)*

Location & Map
--------------

The entrance to Scarlet Monastery is in the northeast corner of Tirisfal Glades. Inside the main building are dungeon portals for each of the four wings. The Cathedral wing is through the closed door on the left as you enter. The door outside the portal can only be opened with [The Scarlet Key](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7146), which is obtained inside the Library wing from a chest behind the last boss, [Arcanist Doan](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scarlet-monastery-library/arcanist-doan). Otherwise you will have to wait for someone else to open the door for you.

Horde can easily reach the Scarlet Monastery from Undercity, but Alliance will have a bit more of a trek to get there, likely passing through Silverpine Forest from Hillsbrad Foothills.
