The Stockade is the Alliance counterpart to [Ragefire Chasm](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/ragefire-chasm/), as it is located directly in Stormwind City. It is a high-security prison housing several violent criminals, but they’re no longer being guarded. You can clear through the jail to shutdown the prison revolution, but The Stockade doesn’t drop much loot.

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should focus on doing as much threat as possible on the boss, so the DPS can go all-out.
* **Healer:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should focus your healing on the tank.
* **Damage Dealers:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should do as much damage as possible while watching your threat. Damage dealers should focus on killing the adds before engaging Targorr the Dread.

Kam Deepfury is the second boss you will encounter in the Stockade. He is a level 27 elite Dark Iron dwarf. He is not officially accompanied by any other monsters, but nearby elite Defias will often join the fight.

[![kam deepfury](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kam-Deepfury.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kam-Deepfury.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should focus on doing as much threat as possible on the boss, so the DPS can go all-out. Kam Deepfury does a high amount of damage while also frequently stunning his target with Shield Slam. Tanks should be aware that an early stun can make holding aggro tricky.
* **Healer:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should focus your healing on the tank. Healers should keep track of their mana, as Kam Deepfury can deal significant damage to the party. Kam will frequently stun the tank using Shield Slam, so be ready for your tank’s health to spike while stunned.
* **Damage Dealers:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should do as much damage as possible while watching your threat. Damage dealers should focus on killing the adds before Kam Deepfury.

#### Loot

* [Kam’s Walking Stick](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/2280)

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should focus on doing as much threat as possible on the boss, so the DPS can go all-out. Tanks should keep in mind that they can interrupt his Chain Lightning if they possess any interrupt abilities.
* **Healer:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should focus your healing on the tank. If you are a Shaman or Priest, purge his Bloodlust effect.
* **Damage Dealers:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should do as much damage as possible while watching your threat. Hamhock is accompanied by two adds that should be killed before engaging him. Damage dealers can interrupt Hamhock’s Chain Lightning and purge his Bloodlust effect.

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** The last boss encounter of the dungeon, Bazil Thredd, deals high amounts of damage while also being accompanied by adds. Tanks should focus on maintaining aggro on the adds while damage dealers kill them.
* **Healer:** For the last boss encounter of the dungeon, healers should focus on maintaining the tank’s health pool. This boss deals significant damage to your tank.
* **Damage Dealers:** In the last boss encounter of the dungeon, damage dealers should focus on dealing as much damage as possible while watching their threat. Bazil Thredd deals high amounts of damage that can be perilous to a damage dealer if they manage to gain his attention.

* **Healer:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should focus your healing on the tank.

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should focus on doing as much threat as possible on the boss, so the DPS can go all-out. Dextren Ward deals significant damage. Tanks should be careful not to lose aggro, and use their defensive cooldowns properly.
* **Healer:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should focus your healing on the tank. Dextren Ward casts Intimidating Shout so healers should beware of this mechanic and keep track of the entire party’s position to quickly get back in healing range.
* **Damage Dealers:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should do as much damage as possible while watching your threat. Damage dealers should focus on killing the adds first before engaging Dextren Ward while being cautious of his Intimidating Shout.

#### Loot
