Gnomeregan is the abandoned capital city of the gnomes. This mechanically advanced city was once thriving, but it was invaded by mutant troggs that were eventually infected (but not killed) with radioactive waste. You’ll kill hordes of troggs and crazed gnomes on your way to eliminating the traitorous Mekgineer Thermaplugg.

Location & Map
--------------

The Gnomeregan dungeon entrance is located in the northwest corner of the Dun Morogh zone, around 24, 40.

Alliance can get to the dungeon by traveling through Dun Morogh from Ironforge. They’ll take an elevator down to enter the exterior tunnels and reach the dungeon portal.

Horde will need to pick up the quest [Chief Engineer Scooty](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/80133) in Orgrimmar and head to Booty Bay to unlock the Goblin Transponder, which teleports players directly to the entrance. This is a huge time saver since the dungeon is quite a trek for Horde otherwise.

There is a back door to the instance which can be unlocked with the [Workshop Key](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6893), but it must first be looted from [Electrocutioner 6000](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/gnomeregan/electrocutioner-6000) inside the dungeon. This back door is found all the way at the north end of the Gnomeregan exterior map.

***Although this quest can be shared, it is recommended that you pick it up yourself.*** This quest must be in progress in order to pick up the quest [Chief Engineer Scooty](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/80133). That quest unlocks the Goblin Transponder that allows you to teleport directly to the dungeon from Booty Bay. The quest is offered by [Sovik](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3413) who is right next to [Nogg](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3412), so it’s very convenient to pick them both up together.

The [Rig Blueprints](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9153) can be obtained by looting [Thermaplugg’s Safe](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/142477), a small lockbox behind the last boss of the dungeon, [Mekgineer Thermaplugg](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/gnomeregan/mekgineer-thermaplugg/map#default). To open it, you will need to loot [Thermaplugg’s Safe Combination](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9299) from [Mekgineer Thermaplugg](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/gnomeregan/mekgineer-thermaplugg/map#default).

To pick up this quest, you will first need to pick up [Rig Wars](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/80132) and [Chief Engineer Scooty](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/80133) in Orgrimmar. Then head to Booty Bay in Stranglethorn Vale. You can get there one of two ways:

* Hop on the zeppelin to Stranglethorn Vale at the tower outside Orgrimmar. Then run or fly from Grom’gol Base Camp to Booty Bay.
* Hop on the boat at Ratchet in The Barrens, which will take you directly to the Booty Bay docks.

This quest simply requires you to wait a few moments for [Scooty](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/7853), and then you’ll be able to turn it in. He’ll give you a [Goblin Transponder](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9173) which allows you to use the transporter beside him to teleport directly to the entrance to Gnomeregan.

You don’t need to keep the [Goblin Transponder](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9173) in your bags at all times. You can simply talk to [Scooty](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/7853) any time you need to use the transporter, and he’ll give you a new one. So you can save yourself a bag slot!

### [Mekgineer Thermaplugg](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/gnomeregan/mekgineer-thermaplugg)

Mekgineer Thermaplugg is the final boss of Gnomeregan, and summons Walking Bomb adds during the encounter.

[![mekgineer thermaplugg](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mekgineer-Thermaplugg.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mekgineer-Thermaplugg.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Tank the boss in the middle of the room, so the Walking Bombs take a long time to reach the group. If you are Knocked Away by Knock Away, reposition in the center of the room. Be ready to immediately Taunt and build threat after each knockback, as his threat table resets.
* **Healer:** Stand away from bombs that spawn and focus your healing on the tank. Other group members will need to be topped off, as they may take damage from the Walking Bombs.
* **Damage Dealers:** Bomb adds will spawn that need to be kited and killed. If you are a ranged DPS, quickly switch to these as they spawn. Thermaplugg will occasionally do Knock Away. After the knock back his threat table resets, so watch your threat generation for a few seconds until it can be picked back up by the tank. Thermaplugg will activate his bomb machines more often at 50% hp and even faster at 20% hp. If your group is overwhelmed with bombs, you can briefly stop their spawn by clicking one of the buttons on the pillars around the room. Assign a ranged DPS to press the buttons in order to stop the bombs from spawning if they prove to be too much.
