To start the chain that leads to this quest, look for [Gryphon Master Talonaxe](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/5636) at Aerie Peak in The Hinterlands. He offers the quest [Witherbark Cages](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/2988).

Return to [Gryphon Master Talonaxe](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/5636) for your next quest, [The Altar of Zul](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/2989). The Altar of Zul is labeled in the southern part of the map. You must enter it through the gate on the north side and run up the pyramid steps to complete the objective. There are two level 50 elites there who you can try to evade, but you can also bring some help and kill them so you can loot the [Sacred Mallet](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9241) from [Qiaga the Keeper](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/7996), as it is needed to create the item that summons [Gahz’rilla](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zulfarrak/gahzrilla#default) inside the dungeon. Either way, head back to [Gryphon Master Talonaxe](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/5636) to progress to [Thadius Grimshade](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/2990). This will bring you to [Thadius Grimshade](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/8022) at Nethergarde Keep in Blasted Lands, who will give you the dungeon quest.

[Nekrum Gutchewer](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/7796) spawns alongside [Shadowpriest Sezz’ziz](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zulfarrak/shadowpriest-sezzziz) at the base of the pyramid during the event that begins when you release [Sergeant Bly](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zulfarrak/sergeant-bly#default) and his crew. Loot him to get [Nekrum’s Medallion](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9471) and return it to [Thadius Grimshade](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/8022) to complete the quest.

Continuing the chain will mean completing one more quest in Blasted Lands followed by two in The Hinterlands, with the final quest rewarding 7900 experience, 2 gold and 25 silver, and your choice of [Gryphon Rider’s Stormhammer](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9651) or [Gryphon Rider’s Leggings](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9652).

He’ll give you the next quest, [Undamaged Venom Sac](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/2934), which tasks you with killing [Witherbark Broodguard](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2686) spiders in the south-central part of The Hinterlands to loot an [Undamaged Venom Sac](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9322). Return this item to [Apothecary Lydon](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2216) to progress to the next quest, [Consult Master Gadrin](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/2935). Now you can visit [Master Gadrin](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3188) at Sen’jin Village in Durotar to pick up this quest.

The [Tablet of Theka](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/142715) is near [Theka the Martyr](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zulfarrak/theka-the-martyr#default), one of the bosses inside Zul’Farrak. Click on it to complete the objective and return to [Master Gadrin](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/3188) to turn in the quest.

You can continue with the chain for some additional rewards. There are two more quests that will send you back to [Apothecary Lydon](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2216) in Alterac Mountains and finally to [Master Apothecary Faranell](http://v) in Undercity.

To complete this quest, you’ll need to be able to summon [Gahz’rilla](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zulfarrak/gahzrilla) at the large pool near the end of the dungeon. To do so, someone in your party must have the [Mallet of Zul’Farrak](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9240).

To create the mallet, you’ll first need to loot the [Sacred Mallet](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9241) from [Qiaga the Keeper](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/7996), a level 50 elite found at the Altar of Zul in The Hinterlands.

This chain continues on and provides quests for the Sunken Temple and Lower Blackrock Spire dungeons, awarding 79,850 experience and a couple of blues along the way, so it’s worth doing the entire thing!

### [Zerillis](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zulfarrak/zerillis) (Rare)

Zerillis is a rare level 46 elite mob who patrols around the altar surrounded by Shadowpriests before you take the first left turn towards Theka’s area. The boss is accompanied by some familiar adds which can be CC’d or dealt with immediately.

[![zerillis](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Zerillis.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Zerillis.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Pull the boss using LoS to a safe location away from others (the top of the hill near the door is a favorite). This fight is a simple tank and spank, but he will try to use only ranged attacks if you do not successfully LoS him.
* **Healer:** The healer simply need to pay attention to all party members health while focusing healing output on the tank.
* **Damage Dealers:** Focus your damage on Zerillis and he will meet his demise shortly.

#### Loot

* [Sandstalker Ankleguards](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12470)

### [Antu’sul](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zulfarrak/antusul)

Antu’sul is the Basilisk boss in Zul’furrak, and is found by passing through the cracked area in the wall to the right upon entering Theka the Martyr’s room. The boss himself is in a cave surrounded by patrolling elite mobs. Clear all of them before engaging the boss, because you will want to fight him outside the cave. The boss already summons Sul’lithuz Broodling and Servant of Antu’sul, so dealing with additional adds is a real headache. The boss will pull when a player gets too close to the cave. Allow the tank to be that player in order to avoid pulling on accident and losing group members early in the encounter.

[![antu'sul](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Antusul.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Antusul.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** To tank this boss successfully, pull Antu’sul out of his cave using a ranged ability and bring him back to the group outside the cave, being careful to avoid any adds that you did not kill before engaging the boss. Basilisk adds will quickly spawn, and you should try to focus on keeping them from killing your healer (or the DPS who should be damaging the adds). The boss uses two healing spells, both of which can and should be interrupted.
* **Healer:** Healing this fight is intense, so be prepared to take care of not only the tank, but any DPS who may be taking damage from totems, lightning, or the Basilisk adds.
* **Damage Dealers:** Use AoE spells to damage the adds that are summoned at the beginning and near the end of the fight. Focus DPS on the adds when they spawn, and then return to damaging Antu’sul. Whenever the boss uses a healing spell, try to help the tank in making sure it is interrupted. Melee DPS should prioritize killing totems whenever they are summoned.

#### Loot

* [Lifeblood Amulet](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9641)
* [Sang’thraze the Deflector](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9379)

### [Theka the Martyr](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zulfarrak/theka-the-martyr)

Theka the Martyr patrols the area around the shallow graves. He is a quick fight but will cast Theka Transform and become immune to physical and shadow damage at 25% health for 30 seconds.

[![theka the martyr](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Theka-the-Martyr.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Theka-the-Martyr.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Maximize threat so DPS can go all out on Theka. If you are able to stun him at 30% then he won’t cast [Theka Transform](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11089) otherwise physical damage won’t do anything to him and you might lose threat.
* **Healer:** Focus healing on the tank. This will be a quick fight.
* **Damage Dealers:** Theka is a mini boss and will go down quick. Focus on DPS and if he casts [Fevered Plague](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8600) dispel it if possible. At 30% if he casts [Theka Transform](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11089) then shadow or physical damage won’t work on him for 30 seconds.

#### Loot

* None

### [Witch Doctor Zum’rah](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zulfarrak/witch-doctor-zumrah)

Witch Doctor Zum’rah is the zombie raising boss in Zul’furrak, found in the next room past Theka. The boss appears as Neutral to all players until you cross into the room the Witch Doctor resides in with his cauldron and treasure chest. The fight is healing intensive and involves numerous Zombie adds and totems. So long as totems and adds are managed without running out of healer mana, this fight should not stop your group’s momentum.

[![witch doctor zum'rah](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Witch-Doctor-Zumrah.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Witch-Doctor-Zumrah.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Run up into Witch Doctor’s room to engage the boss. Use your interrupts to make sure that the boss does not manage to use too many of their abilities. As adds spawn, try to generate some threat to keep them from damaging the other party members too much. Ideally your DPS is good enough the adds will not last long anyways.
* **Healer:** Be sure to find a position at the top of the stairs that does not expose you to the adds immediately when they are summoned, but that gives you a good line of sight on the tank and DPS who may run back out onto the stairs when adds spawn. This fight can be intensive for healers, so conserve mana when you can.
* **Damage Dealers:** In this fight, coordinate interrupts to make sure that Zum’rah does not get many [Shadow Bolt](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12739) casts. Whenever a totem is spawned, DPS should quickly switch over and kill it. Assign a Rogue or other physical DPS to this task. Zombie adds will spawn regularly throughout the fight; prioritize killing the adds first and then return to the Witch Doctor.

#### Loot

* [Jumanza Grips](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18083)
* [Zum’rah’s Vexing Cane](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18082)

### [Dustwraith](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zulfarrak/dustwraith) (Rare)

Dustwraith is rare elite mob in Zul’Furrak, who is located near the pool that Gahz’rilla is summoned from. The rare mob is accompanied by a few adds, which can be CC’d.

[![dustwraith](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Dustwraith.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Dustwraith.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Dustwraith is accompanied by adds who need to be either Tanked or CC’d. Hold threat while your DPS classes damage the boss and adds.
* **Healer:** Keep your focus on the Tank, while being aware of any other damage being taken by party members.
* **Damage Dealers:** Dustwraith is a tank and spank, accompanied by adds. Utilize CC and focus down Dustwraith first.

#### Loot

* [Desertwalker Cane](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12471)

### [Shadowpriest Sezz’ziz](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zulfarrak/shadowpriest-sezzziz)

Shadowpriest Sezz’ziz and Nekrum Gutchewer together are the final wave of the classic zerg, or stair event, started by releasing Seargent Bly and his companions from their execution cages.

[![shadowpriest sezz'ziz](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shadowpriest-Sezzziz.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shadowpriest-Sezzziz.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Engage the bosses by simply walking straight up to them at the bottom of the stairs at end of the event. Establish threat on Nekrum first so that your DPS can open up on the boss. Before Nekrum dies, be sure that you have switched over to Sezz’ziz at least to keep the boss from making another party member their primary target. Use stuns and interrupts to keep Sezz’ziz from healing himself or Nekrum.
* **Healer:** The healer in this encounter should only need to be sure that they are maximum range from Sezz’ziz to avoid being affected by [Psychic Scream](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/15398). Pay attention to party members besides the Tank who may be taking damage.
* **Damage Dealers:** Damage dealing classes should focus down Nekrum Gutchewer first, as he is lower level and should go down quickly. While Nekrum is still alive, assign one melee class member to focus on interrupting any heals that Sezz’ziz may try to put on Nekrum. Upon defeating Nekrum, switch to Shadowpriest Sezz’ziz and maximize damage output.

#### Loot

* [Bad Mojo Mask](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9470)
* [Diabolic Skiver](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9475)
* [Jinxed Hoodoo Kilt](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9474)
* [Jinxed Hoodoo Skin](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9473)

### [Sergeant Bly](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zulfarrak/sergeant-bly)

After defeating Shadowpriest Sezz’ziz, Sergeant Bly’s party remains. Before talking to Bly to start the fight, make sure to talk to Weegli Blastfuse to have him set the charges for the door. If you don’t do that before engaging, you will have to fight him with the rest of the party and also lose out on being able to fight Chief Ukorz Sandscalp. Bly’s group has a standard comp with Bly being the tank. Focus on Murta Grimgut first, as she’s the healer. After her focus on Oro Eyegouge the caster, then Raven the melee and finally Bly.

[![sergeant bly](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sergeant-Bly.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sergeant-Bly.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Focus threat on all of the adds as much as possible to get them to attack you. Let the DPS take care of the healer so you can get a lead on the other party members. Save Bly for last.
* **Healer:** Keep heals up on all of the party members. With a lot of mobs there will be a bit more partywide damage initially. Once some of the adds are down the fight will get easier.
* **Damage Dealers:** Sergeant Bly’s group is similarly structured to a regular group. Focus on Murta Grimgut first as she’s the healer. After her focus on Oro Eyegouge the caster, then Raven the melee and finally Bly.

#### Loot

* None

### [Chief Ukorz Sandscalp](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zulfarrak/chief-ukorz-sandscalp)

Chief Ukorz Sandscalp is a 48 elite Sandfury troll located behind the door that Weegil Blastfuse (the Goblin from Searget Bly’s party) blasts open. Ukorz Sandscalp is accompanied by another Sandfury Troll, Ruuzlu (level 46 elite).

[![chief ukorz sandscalp](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Chief-Ukorz-Sandscalp.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Chief-Ukorz-Sandscalp.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Tank the boss facing the wall to try and keep your other party members form being hit by [Cleave](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/15496). Establish threat on Ruuzlu first so that your DPS do not take over the primary threat position during combat, and be sure that you maintain Ukorz’s attention throughout the encounter as well.
* **Healer:** As long as you stay out of melee range to avoid [Cleave](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/15496) and focus your healing spells on the tank, this fight should not be too healing intensive.
* **Damage Dealers:** Because Ruuzlu is a lower level, focus him down before changing your primary target to Chief Ukorz Sandscalp. Melee DPS should avoid being in front of the Trolls during this encounter in order to avoid [Cleave](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/15496). Ranged DPS can stand away from the boss and focus Ruuzlu, then the Chief.

#### Loot

* [Big Bad Pauldrons](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9476)
* [Embrace of the Lycan](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9479)
* [Jang’thraze the Protector](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/11086)
* [Ripsaw](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9478)
* [The Chief’s Enforcer](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9477)

### [Hydromancer Velratha](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zulfarrak/hydromancer-velratha)

Hydromancer Velratha is in the courtyard where you summon Gahz’rilla. She has multiple abilities and with being tucked around the corner from the entrance it is easy to engage her earlier than expected and deal with her and adds. Be careful with engaging her and this will be a simple fight.

[![hydromancer velratha](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hydromancer-Velratha.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hydromancer-Velratha.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Make sure to clear the area around Velratha before pulling her to make the fight easier. Interrupt where possible as she casts multiple spells.
* **Healer:** Focus healing on the tank. If there weren’t adds pulled with the boss then this fight is easy.
* **Damage Dealers:** Hydromancer Velratha often is pulled accidentally with adds. Do what you can to CC them if this happens. She also has a lot of casting abilities and totems. Focus totems when they come out and interrupt where you can.

#### Loot

* None

### [Gahz’rilla](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zulfarrak/gahzrilla) (Summoned)

This level 46 elite hydra is a summoned boss in Zul’furrak. The [Mallet of Zul’furrak](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9240) must be used on the gong to ring it and call forth Gahz’rilla. Be careful to clear adds on the side of the pool closest to the entrance to prevent stray mobs from entering the boss fight.

[![gahz'rilla](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Gahzrilla.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Gahzrilla.png)
#### How to Summon Gahz’rilla

To create the mallet that is needed to summon the boss, you’ll first need to loot the [Sacred Mallet](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9241) from [Qiaga the Keeper](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/7996), a level 50 elite found at the Altar of Zul in The Hinterlands. Take this item to the altar at the very top of Jintha’Alor in the east (also in The Hinterlands). Use it there to get the [Mallet of Zul’Farrak](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9240). Be sure to bring this item into the dungeon so you can use it at the gong to summon the boss.

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Either tank the boss in the pool of water where he spawns or to the left of the archway where you entered the room to minimize fall damage. If you tank him in the pool of water, the group will take less fall damage (as hopefully everyone lands in the pool when they are knocked back). There is a ruin to the left of the entrance which you can wedge yourself and the rest of the group underneath so that upon the knock up from [Gahz’rilla Slam](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11902) is negated by bouncing off the stones.
* **Healer:** Healing this fight is fairly straightforward. All party members will take fall damage, so try your best to keep everyone topped off as to not die on impact.
* **Damage Dealers:** All damage dealing players should stack up on the front of the boss. Focus on consistent damage output. The boss has a lot of health compared to others in this instance.

#### Loot

* [Gahz’rilla Fang](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9467)
* [Gahz’rilla Scale Armor](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/9469)

### [Sandarr Dunereaver](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/zulfarrak/sandarr-dunereaver) (Rare)

This rare is on the way out of the instance after Gahz’rilla. Make sure to take a quick look before zoning out. He is a simple boss as long as you pull him without adds.

[![sandarr dunereaver](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sandarr-Dunereaver.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sandarr-Dunereaver.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Maximize threat so the DPS can down the boss. Make sure adds aren’t pulled.
* **Healer:** This is a simple fight if no extra adds are pulled. Focus the tank.
* **Damage Dealers:** This rare is easy if pulled by himself. Focus DPS on him but don’t out threat the tank.

#### Loot

* None
