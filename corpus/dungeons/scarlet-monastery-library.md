Scarlet Monastery was originally used for priests in Lordaeron, but became the home of the Scarlet Crusade when the undead rose. The Scarlet Crusade fiercely hates any race that is not human, as you’ll find almost exclusively humans throughout the monastery. It is split into four wings, each containing several enemies and bosses. The library takes you through the preserved knowledge of Lordaeron, ending at Arcanist Doan.

* **Level Requirement**: 21
* **Recommended Level**: 30-40
* **Location**: Tirisfal Glades
* **Boss Encounters:** [Houndmaster Loksey](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scarlet-monastery-library/houndmaster-loksey), [Arcanist Doan](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scarlet-monastery-library/arcanist-doan)
* **[Loot Drops](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scarlet-monastery-library/loot):** *[Hypnotic Blade](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7714)*, *[Illusionary Rod](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7713)*, *[Dog Whistle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/3456)*

Location & Map
--------------

The entrance to Scarlet Monastery is in the northeast corner of Tirisfal Glades. Inside the main building are dungeon portals for each of the four wings. The Library wing is the open portal that is farthest to the right as you enter.

Horde can easily reach the Scarlet Monastery from Undercity, but Alliance will have a bit more of a trek to get there, likely passing through Silverpine Forest from Hillsbrad Foothills.

Bosses
------

There are only two bosses inside the Library wing of Scarlet Monastery.

* [Houndmaster Loksey](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scarlet-monastery-library/houndmaster-loksey)
* [Arcanist Doan](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scarlet-monastery-library/arcanist-doan)

### [Houndmaster Loksey](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scarlet-monastery-library/houndmaster-loksey)

Houndmaster Loksey is the first boss of Scarlet Monastery Library. He is a level 34 elite Scarlet Crusade human, accompanied by three Scarlet Tracking Hounds.

[![houndmaster loksey](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Houndmaster-Loksey.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Houndmaster-Loksey.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Mark the hounds with a Skull and X and prioritize threat on those targets. Use any AoE abilities you have to maintain threat on all of the hounds, and the boss. Beware that when the boss and his hounds are under the effect of Bloodlust, they will do a lot of damage. Use defensive cooldowns, health potions and healthstones if you get low.
* **Healer:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should focus your healing on the tank. In case any of your damage dealers take aggro from your tank, you should prioritize keeping them alive. Houndmaster Loksey deals high amounts of damage and the fight is relatively long, so manage your mana. If you are a shaman or a priest, use Purge or Dispel Magic to remove the Bloodlust effect off both the boss and his hounds.
* **Damage Dealers:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should do as much damage as possible while watching your threat. Houndmaster Loksey is accompanied by a pack of Scarlet Hounds that need to be focused first. Area of Effect spells and abilities are highly useful in this encounter, but be sure to give your tank some time to generate threat before AoEing. If your class has an offensive dispel such as Purge or Dispel Magic, use it to dispel the Bloodlust buff on the boss and his hounds.

#### Loot

* [Dog Training Gloves](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7756)
* [Dog Whistle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/3456)
* [Loksey’s Training Stick](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7710)

### [Arcanist Doan](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scarlet-monastery-library/arcanist-doan)

Arcanist Doan is the last boss of Scarlet Monastery Library. Arcanist Doan is a level 37 Scarlet Crusade human. He is not accompanied by any adds but in order to reach him you must clear the instance to get to his chamber.

[![arcanist doan](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Arcanist-Doan.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Arcanist-Doan.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** This fight requires tactical maneuvering, cooldowns management, and a great deal of caution. Arcanist Doan is not accompanied by any adds but poses great danger alone, use your defensive cooldowns cautiously. Beware of losing threat, as Arcanist Doan can easily kill your damage dealers. When Arcanist Doan casts Detonation, move outside his room and hide next to the walls of his chamber.
* **Healer:** This fight requires tactical maneuvering, mana management, and a great deal of caution. Arcanist Doan will frequently apply Silence on the players. Keep your party’s health pool up at all times while managing your mana. When Arcanist Doan casts Detonation, move outside his room and hide next to the walls of his chamber. Arcanist Doan’s Polymorph can be avoided if you place yourself 30 yards away from him.
* **Damage Dealers:** This fight requires tactical maneuvering, mana management, and a great deal of caution. Arcanist Doan possesses several abilities that will hinder damage dealers. His abilities cannot be interrupted. Damage dealers along with the Tank and Healer should get out of the room when Arcanist Doan casts Detonation and hide next to the walls of his chamber. Arcanist Doan can be mana drained in order to stop him from casting his spells.

#### Loot

* [Hypnotic Blade](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7714)
* [Illusionary Rod](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7713)
