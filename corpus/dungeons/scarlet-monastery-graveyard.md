Scarlet Monastery was originally used for priests in Lordaeron, but became the home of the Scarlet Crusade when the undead arose. The Scarlet Crusade fiercely hates any race that is not human, as you’ll find almost exclusively humans throughout the monastery. It is split into four wings, each containing different enemies and bosses. The graveyard explores the torture chambers which lead through the monastery’s graveyard to its crypt.

Location & Map
--------------

The entrance to Scarlet Monastery is in the northeast corner of Tirisfal Glades. Inside the main building are dungeon portals for each of the four wings. The Graveyard wing is the open portal that is farthest to the left as you enter.

Horde can easily reach the Scarlet Monastery from Undercity, but Alliance will have a bit more of a trek to get there, likely passing through Silverpine Forest from Hillsbrad Foothills.

Interrogator Vishas is the first boss your will encounter in Scarlet Monastery Graveyard. He is a level 32 elite Scarlet Crusade human.

[![interrogator vishas](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Interrogator-Vishas.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Interrogator-Vishas.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Use AoE abilities to generate threat on all the adds that accompany Interrogator Vishas. Mark adds with Skull and X and prioritize threat on those targets.
* **Healer:** Focus healing on your tank, but be ready to quickly heal any DPS that pull aggro.
* **Damage Dealers:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should do as much damage as possible while watching your threat. Damage dealers should focus on killing the adds before engaging Interrogator Vishas.

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should focus on doing as much threat as possible on the boss, so the DPS can go all-out. Bloodmage Thalnos casts Shadow Bolt and can not be interrupted. If you are already at low HP, consider running away when he begins casting Flame Spike to avoid taking damage.
* **Healer:** Be sure to stand as far away from the boss as possible to avoid getting hit by his Flame Spike. Be ready to heal any group members that did not make it out of Flame Spike in time.
* **Damage Dealers:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should do as much damage as possible while watching your threat. Bloodmage Thalnos casts Shadow Bolt, Flame Spike, Flame Shock and can not be interrupted. If you are a ranged DPS, be sure to stand as far away from the boss as possible to avoid getting hit by his Flame Spike. If you are a melee DPS, consider running away when he begins casting Flame Spike to avoid taking damage.

Scorn is **only available during the Scourge Invasion event**. Make sure to get any of the items off of him before he disappears. He hits harder than your average mob in this dungeon so approach him warily. He only spawns after Bloodmage Thalnos has been defeated.

[![scorn](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scorn.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Scorn.png)
