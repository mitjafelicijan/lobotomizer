The Temple of Atal’hakkar was formed when a group of Gurubashi troll priests were exiled for their efforts to revive Hakkar the Soulflayer, one of the ancient blood gods. They sought refuge in Swamp of Sorrows and constructed a temple to summon Hakkar from. The temple was ultimately smashed by Ysera, the dragon aspect, and is now protected by green dragons and surviving trolls.

Location & Map
--------------

The Temple of Atal’hakkar is often referred to as **Sunken Temple** because the dungeon is half buried beneath the large lake in the Swamp of Sorrows zone. The location is a little more convenient for Horde players, who have a nearby hub at Stonard. Alliance will need to either run across Deadwind Pass from Darkshire, or run north from Nethergarde Keep in Blasted Lands.

You’ll need to swim or walk on water to reach the temple entrance in the center of the lake. From there, you’ll navigate a maze of watery passages full of level 46-48 elites to find the the dungeon portal. From the top, head down until you reach water and then swim across the Broken Hall. Follow the path around to the Hall of Masks and exit through the other doorway on the south wall. Go left at the fork and pass by the first doorway to round a corner and reach the Den of the Caller. Turn left in this room, entering the doorway that is marked by the mask and not the doorway with the tablets. Continue through the long Hall of Ritual and head down the stairs to arrive in the Hall of Bones. Take the stairs or jump down one level to the middle tier of this room, and you’ll find the dungeon portal inside the wide doorway opposite where you entered.

### Atal’alarion

Atal’alarion is the Guardian of the Idol in the lower level of the instance, the Pit of Refuse. To summon the boss, your party will need to coordinate clicking the 6 shrines in the Pit in the correct order, which is: 1. South 2. North 3. Southwest 4. Southeast 5. Northwest 6. Northeast. Perform this task correctly to not only summon the boss, but to avoid being left with a pesky curse.

Atal’alarion will spawn in the center of the room. This boss should be approached first within the Sunken Temple of Atal’hakkar. Not only is entering the Pit of Refuse on the same level of the entrance (and approached by heading to the right from the portal), but if you attempt to jump down into the pit from the hole in top, you will almost certainly die to fall damage.

[![atal'alarion](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Atalalarion.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Atalalarion.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Engage Atal’alarion in the center of the Pit of Refuse, and then move him to face a wall. The boss’ [Sweeping Slam](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12887) is a frontal cone ability, and you do not want to subject your other party members to its effects. Pay attention to who in your group is being knocked into the air at what time. If your Healer is being sent airborne, kite the boss around the room to try and avoid taking significant damage before your healer is available again.
* **Healer:** While healing, try to stay at maximum distance from the boss while focusing your heals on the Tank. Whenever players are knocked into the air, anticipate them taking fall damage. Using variety of shields can help mitigate this damage.
* **Damage Dealers:** Melee DPS can open up on Atal’alarion as soon as the Tank has established threat, at the beginning of the encounter and each time that threat is wiped. Ranged DPS should remain at maximum distance from the boss, primarily so that when threat is wiped the tank has some time to pull the boss back into position before your Ranged DPS are hit by Atal’alarion’s powerful melee attacks.

#### Loot

* [Atal’alarion’s Tusk Ring](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10798)
* [Darkwater Bracers](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10800)
* [Headspike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10799)

### Spawn of Hakkar

Spawn of Hakkar is a boss located in the Sunken Temple. This mob is sought after by Hunters as a powerful pet.

[![spawn of hakkar](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Spawn-of-Hakkar.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Spawn-of-Hakkar.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Maintain threat on the boss while DPS maximize their damage output.
* **Healer:** Keep your Tank topped off, and be aware of who is affected by [Acid of Hakkar](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12280), as they will require additional healing.
* **Damage Dealers:** Melee and Ranged DPS classes need to focus their damage output on the boss.

#### Loot

* [Slitherscale Boots](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10801)
* [Wingveil Cloak](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10802)

### Troll Mini-Bosses

Located on six different platforms around the top ring of the instance are six different Troll Mini Bosses. Four of the bosses are found by using the staircases on the outside of the circular hallway, and the other two via staircases on the inside curve of the hallway. All six must be defeated before you can move on the Jammal’an the Prophet and Ogom the Wretched. The Six Trolls Bosses and their corresponding abilities are:

* Loro, who has the Shield Spike ability
* Hukku, a warlock type who casts Shadow Bolt and Summons traditional pets like the Voidwalker, Imp, and Succubus
* Zul’lor, who reduces the groups stats using Frailty
* Zolo, a shaman type who casts Chain Lightning and summons skeleton adds with his totems
* Mijan, who casts a Healing Ward totem throughout the fight
* Gasher, who has Dual Wield and a fast melee attack speed

None of these bosses are particularly challenging in that they do not have much health, can be stunned, and range from level 50-52 elite.

[![troll mini bosses](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Troll-Mini-Bosses.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Troll-Mini-Bosses.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Each of the Troll Mini Bosses can be considered a Tank and Spank fight, so establish yourself on the threat table and let your DPS burn them down.
* **Healer:** The Troll Mini Bosses do not hit particularly hard, but it is still important to try and keep everyone topped off throughout the fight.
* **Damage Dealers:** Use your class’ abilities to smooth over the encounter. For example, these mobs can be stunned and have their casts interrupted. Focus your DPS output on each of the bosses without overcoming your tank’s threat position.

#### Loot

* [Atal’ai Boots](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10786)
* [Atal’ai Breastplate](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10784)
* [Atal’ai Girdle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10788)
* [Atal’ai Gloves](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10787)
* [Atal’ai Leggings](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10785)
* [Atal’ai Spaulders](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10783)

### Jammal’an the Prophet

Jammal’an is accessible after the 6 Troll Mini Bosses have been defeated. To make your way down to his chamber, the Lair of the Chosen, either go back to the entrance and instead take the path to the left, or jump off of whichever Troll Mini Boss’ platform you finished on. If you choose to jump, your group should pick one pack of Dragonkin to land on and prepare to engage immediately, with some big heals. Once you clear the Pit of Sacrifice enough to enter the eastern passageway, clear all of the troll and Atal’ai Deathwalker mobs from the area before engaging Jammal’an. The boss is a level 54 Elite, and is accompanied by level 53 elite Ogom the Wretched.

[![jammal'an the prophet](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Jammalan-the-Prophet.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Jammalan-the-Prophet.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** If your group has a strong DPS class who can off tank, assign them to Ogom and allow for DPS to burn him down quickly. The main tank should separate Jammal’an from the group and establish threat. Be careful not to stack up to avoid having to reposition for [Flamestrike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12468). It is also helpful to have distance between players for when [Hex of Jammal’an](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12480) goes out, so that there is not an easy target for the player transformed into a Berserker to crush.
* **Healer:** Healing this encounter will be more intense during the beginning, when both Ogom and Jammal’an are both still alive. Try to keep everyone topped off to avoid losing a player to a damaging mechanic! Be careful not to stack up to avoid having to reposition for [Flamestrike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12468). It is also helpful to have distance between players for when [Hex of Jammal’an](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12480) goes out, so that there is not an easy target for the player transformed into a Berserker to crush. [Shadow Word: Pain](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/10892) can be dispelled, and [Curse of Weakness](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11707) should be removed from Physical DPS and the tank.
* **Damage Dealers:** The primary target for DPS at the beginning of the encounter is Ogom the Wretched, as he is a lower level and has less health. If your group has a strong physical DPS class, like a Warrior DPS, Ret Paladin, or Rogue, utilize them as an off tank on Ogom and burn him down. Be careful not to stack up to avoid having to reposition for [Flamestrike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12468). It is also helpful to have distance between players for when [Hex of Jammal’an](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12480) goes out, so that there is not an easy target for the player transformed into a Berserker to crush. Mages and Druids should decurse [Curse of Weakness](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11707) from physical DPS classes and the tank.

#### Loot

* [Blade of the Wretched](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10803)
* [Eater of the Dead](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10805)
* [Fist of the Damned](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10804)
* [Gloves of the Atal’ai Prophet](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10808)
* [Kilt of the Atal’ai Prophet](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10807)
* [Vestments of the Atal’ai Prophet](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10806)

### Weaver & Dreamscythe

Weaver will spawn at the same time as Dreamscythe in the Pit of Sacrifice, upon the defeat of Jammal’an the Prophet. The two drakes will patrol the area on a similar path, so be careful to only pull one of them at a time.

[![weaver and dreamscythe](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Weaver-and-Dreamscythe.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Weaver-and-Dreamscythe.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Use a ranged pull if available to engage only one of the drakes at a time. Pull the boss into the hallway, and tank the boss up against a wall facing away from the group to minimize the effects of the boss’ knockback ability and keep your other party members out of harms way.
* **Healer:** While healing, stay away from the front of the drake and focus your healing on the Tank, as other party members should not be taking damage.
* **Damage Dealers:** Both Melee and Ranged DPS players should stand away from the front of the boss to avoid it’s frontal cone attacks. Otherwise, just make sure the tank has threat and maximize your DPS output.

#### Loot

* [Bloodfire Talons](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12464)
* [Dawnspire Cord](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12466)
* [Drakeclaw Band](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10795)
* [Drakefang Butcher](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12463)
* [Drakestone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10796)
* [Firebreather](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10797)
* [Nightfall Drape](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12465)
* [Smoldering Claw](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12243)

### Hazzas & Morphaz

Hazzas and Morphaz are the final two drake bosses in Sunken Temple, and they have the same abilities and strategy as the previous two bosses. They spawn at the same time, upon the defeat of Dreamscythe and Weaver. The two drakes will patrol the area on a similar path and it is not possible to pull them individually so plan to fight both together.

[![hazzas and morphaz](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hazzas-and-Morphaz.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hazzas-and-Morphaz.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Pull the bosses into the hallway, and Tank the bosses up against a wall facing away from the group to minimize the effects of the boss’ knockback ability and keep your other party members out of harms way.
* **Healer:** While healing, stay away from the front of the drakes and focus your healing on the Tank, as other party members should not be taking damage.
* **Damage Dealers:** Both Melee and Ranged DPS players should stand away from the front of the bosses to avoid it’s frontal cone attacks. Otherwise, just make sure the tank has threat and maximize your DPS output.

#### Loot

* [Bloodfire Talons](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12464)
* [Dawnspire Cord](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12466)
* [Drakeclaw Band](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10795)
* [Drakefang Butcher](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12463)
* [Drakestone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10796)
* [Firebreather](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10797)
* [Nightfall Drape](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12465)
* [Smoldering Claw](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12243)

### Shade of Eranikus

The Shade of Eranikus is a level 55 elite and does not require a special summoning ritual or quest. Be 100% sure that you have cleared all of the dragonkin mobs in the rest of the instance before you engage the Shade of Eranikus, or they will all run to aid him in combat (and likely wipe your group). The boss is challenging, especially compared to other final bosses in previous 5 man content.

[![shade of eranikus](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shade-of-Eranikus.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shade-of-Eranikus.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Engage the boss where he stands, and face him away from the rest of the group to avoid anyone but yourself being hit by [Corrosive Acid Breath](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/16359). The boss will target the player with the highest threat for [Deep Slumber](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12890). If available, allow for a pet to tank the boss until his first cast of [Deep Slumber](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12890), then trade in your primary tank. You can also use a second tank if your group has one. A druid in Bear Form, Warrior, or a Paladin using [Righteous Fury](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/25780) can take the second threat position and hold the boss while your primary tank sleeps off their [Deep Slumber](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12890).
* **Healer:** This fight can last quite a long time in comparison to other 5 man bosses, so conserve your mana. [Grounding Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8177) can negate the effects of [Deep Slumber](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12890). Keep the tank topped off at all times, as they will be affected by [War Stomp](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11876) throughout the fight and unable to block.
* **Damage Dealers:** All DPS need to be aware of positioning in this encounter. Ranged DPS should stay at maximum range and avoid being in front of the boss to not be affected by [War Stomp](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11876) or [Corrosive Acid Breath](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/16359). Using [Grounding Totem](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8177) negates the effect of [Deep Slumber](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12890).

#### Loot

* [Dire Nail](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10828)
* [Dragon’s Call](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10847)

* [Tooth of Eranikus](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10837)

### Avatar of Hakkar

Avatar of Hakkar is a challenging encounter that requires you to have completed the prerequisite Ancient Egg questline which is started in Tanaris. The boss’ summoning location is located in a smaller room at the western side of the Pit of Sacrifice. Enter the room and begin killing adds. Defeat four Hakkari Bloodkeepers as they spawn, and use their Hakkari Blood to extinguish the four braziers arranged in a rectangle around the room. Before extinguishing the final brazier, if all group members stack up against the wall you will not trigger proximity aggro on the boss and can drop combat for long enough to eat, drink, resurrect your friends, or rebuff. After a quick recovery, engage the Avatar of Hakkar.

[![avatar of hakkar](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Avatar-of-Hakkar.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Avatar-of-Hakkar.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Tank the boss in the middle of the room, and maintain threat for the entirety of the encounter. Utilize stun or other CC effects on the player affected by [Cause Insanity](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12888).
* **Healer:** The fight is not incredibly healing intensive, but you’ll want to be sure that everyone is topped off at all times in case you are mind controlled by [Cause Insanity](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12888). Dispel [Shadow Word: Pain](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/10892) when possible. Decurse the boss’ [Curse of Tongues](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/13338) from yourself and from your caster companions.
* **Damage Dealers:** Spread out and maximize your damage output while ensuring that your tank maintains the primary threat position. When Avatar of Hakkar uses [Cause Insanity](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12888), use stuns or other CC effects to keep the mind controlled player from dealing too much damage to your party members. Help your healers by dispelling [Shadow Word: Pain](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/10892). Decurse the boss’ [Curse of Tongues](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/13338) from yourself and from your caster companions.

I've been playing World of Warcraft on and off since vanilla, usually as a healer or caster and often as a guild leader. I play both retail and classic. I also love RPGs, sandboxes, and sims.
