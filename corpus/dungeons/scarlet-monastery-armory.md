Scarlet Monastery was originally used for priests in Lordaeron, but became the home of the Scarlet Crusade when the undead rose. The Scarlet Crusade fiercely hates any race that is not human, as you’ll find almost exclusively humans throughout the monastery. It is split into four wings, each containing several enemies and bosses. Within the Armory are the tools of war used by the Scarlet Crusade, with their champion, Herod at the end.

* **Level Requirement**: 21
* **Recommended Level**: 32-42
* **Location**: Tirisfal Glades
* **Boss Encounters:** [Herod](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scarlet-monastery-armory/herod)
* **Loot Drops:** *[Herod’s Shoulder](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7718), [Raging Berserker’s Helm](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7719), [Ravager](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7717), [Scarlet Leggings](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10330)*

Location & Map
--------------

The entrance to Scarlet Monastery is in the northeast corner of Tirisfal Glades. Inside the main building are dungeon portals for each of the four wings. The Armory wing is through the closed door on the right as you enter. The door outside the portal can only be opened with [The Scarlet Key](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7146), which is obtained inside the Library wing from a chest behind the last boss, [Arcanist Doan](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scarlet-monastery-library/arcanist-doan). Otherwise you will have to wait for someone else to open the door for you.

Horde can easily reach the Scarlet Monastery from Undercity, but Alliance will have a bit more of a trek to get there, likely passing through Silverpine Forest from Hillsbrad Foothills.

* [Herod](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scarlet-monastery-armory/herod)

### [Herod](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scarlet-monastery-armory/herod)

Herod is the only boss encounter of Scarlet Monastery Armory. He is a level 40 elite Scarlet Crusade human. He is not accompanied by any adds but in order to reach him you need to clear the entire instance. Upon his death, a large group of Scarlet Monastery Acolytes will rush to his chambers so be prepared to continue combat after defeating him.

[![herod](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Herod.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Herod.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should focus on doing as much threat as possible on the boss, so the DPS can go all-out. You should move a few yards from him when he is casting Whirlwind to avoid taking unnecessary damage. After the boss dies, dozens of Scarlet Crusaders will storm the room. Quickly walk up to the entrance of Herod’s room and be ready to use AoE abilities to pick them up.
* **Healer:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should focus your healing on the tank. In case any of your damage dealers take aggro from your tank, you should prioritize keeping them alive. After the boss dies dozens of Scarlet Crusaders will storm the room. Allow your tank a few moments to generate threat on them before healing.
* **Damage Dealers:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should do as much damage as possible while watching your threat. While casting Whirlwind, Herod is immune to damage while also dealing heavy area of effect damage to anyone around him. As a melee DPS, you should move a few yards from him to avoid taking unnecessary damage. After the boss dies, dozens of Scarlet Crusaders will storm the room. Allow your tank a few moments to generate threat on them before using any AoE abilities.
