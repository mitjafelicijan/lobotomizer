[Dire Maul](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/dire-maul/) is the remains of Eldre’Thalas, the Highborne city that held all of Queen Azshara’s most valuable secrets on the arcane arts. The massive dungeon is split into three wings, although only the East Wing is accessible without a key. Once acquiring a key you can access the West dungeon, also known as the Capital Gardens, which is filled with undead and arcane elementals. Deactivate all pylons to proceed forward toward the chamber holding Immol’thar and eventually end in the ancient library and confront Prince Tortheldrin.

The Dire Maul instances are the only dungeons that are not available in WoW Classic at launch. They are added in [Phase 2](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/content-phases/).

Location & Map
--------------

The entrance to Dire Maul West is on the western wall of the central courtyard in Dire Maul. The [Crescent Key](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18249) is required to open the door; it can be looted from [Pusillin](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/dire-maul-east/pusillin) in Dire Maul East. There are two entrances, but they are very close together, so it doesn’t really matter which one you enter through.

There are five large crystals scattered around the instance which must be deactivated to access [Immol’thar](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/dire-maul-west/immolthar) and [Prince Tortheldrin](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/dire-maul-west/prince-tortheldrin). The first crystal is in the middle of the Capital Gardens right in front of where you enter. There are two more upstairs in the Court of the Highborne. The final two are on either side of the doorway as you enter the Prison of Immol’thar. To deactivate each, you will need to kill all of the [Arcane Aberration](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11480)s and [Mana Remnant](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11483)s that surround it.

Technically, Dire Maul West and Dire Maul North are part of the same instance, connected by The Athenaeum with no portals in between. Our guides consider The Athenaeum to be part of Dire Maul West since it houses the final boss of that wing. However, most of the time when players access The Athenaeum, it will be from the Dire Maul North side, which can be done without fighting any mobs.

[![tendris warpwood](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Tendris-Warpwood.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Tendris-Warpwood.png)

[![magister kalendris](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Magister-Kalendris.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Magister-Kalendris.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Engage Kalendris and pull him away from the group. Interrupt [Mind Blast](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/17287) and [Mind Flay](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/22919) as much as possible. Maintain the primary threat position throughout the fight. If you are effected by Dominate Mind, quickly taunt the boss back to your attention when you get control back.
* **Healer:** Utilize [Prayer of Shadow Protection](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/27683) or [Shadow Resistance Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/19896) to reduce damage taken by the party. The only player who should be taking immediate damage from the boss is the tank, but keep all players topped off. When the player affected by [Dominate Mind](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7645) returns to control of their character, make sure to bring them back to full health. Dispel [Shadow Word: Pain].
* **Damage Dealers:** Allow your Tank to establish threat on the boss before beginning your DPS rotation. Interrupt [Mind Blast](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/17287) and [Mind Flay](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/22919) as much as possible. Utilize CC on whichever player is affected by [Dominate Mind](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7645).

#### Loot

* [Amplifying Cloak](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18350)
* [Elder Magus Pendant](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18397)

### Tsu’zee (Rare)

Tsu’zee is a rare boss who spawns near Magister Kalendris’ area at the bottom of the ramps.

[![tsu'zee](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Tsuzee.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Tsuzee.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Establish threat on the boss and keep her in front of you to avoid being hit by [Backstab](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/7159). You will likely be affected by [Gouge](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12540). When the incapacitation effect wears off, taunt the boss back into position.
* **Healer:** Tsu’zee deals considerable damage, so make sure your tank is topped off. Dispel [Blind](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/21060), and be aware that the boss may [Gouge](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12540) the tank and switch to a secondary threat target.
* **Damage Dealers:** Make sure your tank has threat before you begin maximizing your damage output on Tsu’zee. Dispel [Blind](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/21060), and be aware of who is affected by [Gouge](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12540). If it is the tank, you may be getting threat from the boss until they are able to pick her back up.

#### Loot

* [Brightspark Gloves](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18387)
* [Murmuring Ring](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18345)
* [Threadbare Trousers](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18346)

### Illyanna Ravenoak

Illyanna Ravenoak is located above Tendris Warpwood’s area and accessed from the ramps in the Court of the Highborne. The boss is accompanied by her pet bear, Ferra. The bosses ranged abilities can be nullified simply by standing in melee range. Watch out for Immolation Trap.

[![illyanna ravenoak](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Illyanna-Ravenoak.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Illyanna-Ravenoak.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Pull Ferra onto the top of Illyanna and fight them stacked up. Maintain threat on Illyanna primarily as this is DPS’ main target. Once she is dead, switch to Ferra.
* **Healer:** If possible, use [Hibernate](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/18658) to sleep Ferra. Stack up in melee range to avoid being targeted by the boss’ ranged abilities. Focus your healing on the tank, who will be taking damage from both Illyanna and her pet Ferra until the boss is down. All members of the group will take some damage from [Immolation Trap](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/22910) and/or [Volley](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/14295) during the encounter, so be prepared to switch your healing target to keep all party members topped off.
* **Damage Dealers:** Use [Hibernate](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/18658), if available, on Ferra and focus your damage output on Illyanna. All DPS should stand in Melee range to avoid letting the boss use her ranged abilities. Watch out for [Immolation Trap](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/22910). Focus on Illyanna first, then switch to Ferra.

#### Loot

* [Force Imbued Gauntlets](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18383)
* [Gauntlets of Accuracy](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18349)
* [Padre’s Trousers](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18386)
* [Well Balanced Axe](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18347)

### Immol’thar

Immol’thar is a beast trapped beneath the West wing of Dire Maul. The boss has a few abilities, but the most important to be aware of are the adds that will be summoned around the room which need to be handled. The boss will also teleport players to the middle of the room, causing a threat drop on that player. If this is the tank, stop all DPS until threat is reestablished. Immol’thar has an early enrage at 50%, so prepare cooldowns for the second half of the fight.

[![immol'thar](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Immolthar.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Immolthar.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Tank the boss just off the middle of the room where he stands. If you are teleported to the middle of the room, the boss will engage with whoever is the second threat position. Regain Immol’thar’s attention and continue the fight. Save defensive cooldowns for when you are affected by [Infected Bite](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/16128) and when the boss is [Enrage](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8269) – this is when you will be taking the most damage.
* **Healer:** Keep all members of the group topped off as best you can. Save your cooldowns for when the boss’ [Enrage](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/8269) at 50% health. The tank will be occasionally affected by [Infected Bite](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/16128) and require additional healing. You may be teleported to the middle of the room – just return to your position.
* **Damage Dealers:** Allow for the tank to establish threat before opening up on the boss. Assign a DPS, like a Hunter, to focus on destroying the Eyes that are summoned around the room. You may be teleported to the middle of the room – just return to your position.

### Prince Tortheldrin

Prince Tortheldrin is the final boss of Dire Maul West and is located in the Athenaeum, through a small tunnel from Immol’thar’s prison. Note that if you enter from Dire Maul North and do not depose the crystal pylons throughout West, Prince Tortheldrin will not be present in the Southwest corner of the Athenaeum.

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Position the boss in a corner so that you are not knocked around by [Arcane Blast](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/22920) too much. When Prince Tortheldrin uses [Arcane Blast](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/22920), all threat will be reset. Reestablish yourself atop the threat meter so that your DPS can safely burn the boss down.
* **Healer:** The tank and other melee players will take some damage from [Whirlwind](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/15578) and [Arcane Blast](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/22920), so try to keep everyone topped off. The boss may target you with [Counterspell](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/20537).
* **Damage Dealers:** Prince Tortheldrin uses his [Arcane Blast](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/22920) as a knockback which also drops threat. Be sure your tank has established threat after this ability before you continue with DPS. All players in melee range will be hit with [Arcane Blast](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/22920) and [Whirlwind](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/15578).

### Lord Hel’nurath

Lord Hel’nurath is a Summoned boss in Dire Maul West which is the final part of the Warlock Epic Mount questline. The ritual leading up to Hel’nurath’s spawning takes place where Immol’thar is fought. The beginning of the ritual mandates the raid kill waves of demon adds which spawn while the Warlock in the group uses their J’eevee’s Jar, Black Lodestone, and Xorothian Glyphs at the correct times. Lord Hel’nurath himself is not complex, but the event itself can be slightly overwhelming.

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Pick up adds as they spawn using AoE threat generating effects. When Hel’nurath spawns, hold threat off of the DPS who are damaging him. Move to the Xorothian Dreadsteed afterwards.
* **Healer:** This event is long, so conserve mana as best as you can. Keep your tank topped off, but ensure your Warlock lives as well or else you will have to run the encounter again.
* **Damage Dealers:** The Warlock in the group needs to utilize their summoning reagents as well as [Banish](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/18647) and [Enslave Demon](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11726). The Dread Guard adds deal significant damage and can be Enslaved to help defeat adds. Other DPS classes need to focus on using AoE effects to damage the adds as they spawn. Once Hel’nurath is present, focus on damaging him and not the Xorothian Dreadsteed. Move to the horse after Hel’nurath is dead.

#### Loot

* [Diabolic Mantle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18757)
* [Dreadguard’s Protector](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18756)
* [Fel Hardened Bracers](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18754)
