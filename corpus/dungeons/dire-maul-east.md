[Dire Maul](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/dire-maul/) is the remains of Eldre’Thalas, the Highborne city that held all of Queen Azshara’s most valuable secrets on the arcane arts. The massive dungeon is split into three wings, with the key to the other two wings being found inside Dire Maul East, making it a necessary first stop for most players. The East wing is also known as The Warpwood Quarter, and is a popular site for so farming in the form of “Jump Runs.”

The Dire Maul instances are the only dungeons that are not available in WoW Classic at launch. They are added in [Phase 2](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/content-phases/).

Location & Map
--------------

There are three entrances to Dire Maul East. One is on the east wall of the central courtyard in Dire Maul. Another is entered from Eldreth Row at the entrance to Dire Maul. These both lead into the upper level of the Warpwood Quarter.

The third entrance is found slightly northeast of Camp Mojache at Lariss Pavillion, but the [Crescent Key](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18249) is required to enter that door. This door leads to the other end of the instance.

To open the Conservatory Door inside the instance and reach the last room with [Alzzin the Wildshaper](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/dire-maul-east/alzzin-the-wildshaper), you’ll need to kill [Zevrim Thornhoof](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/dire-maul-east/zevrim-thornhoof) and speak to [Old Ironbark](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11491).

[![dire maul east wow classic map](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Dire-Maul-East-WoW-Classic-Map-1.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Dire-Maul-East-WoW-Classic-Map-1.png)

Farming & “Jump Runs”
---------------------

Dire Maul East is a popular dungeon for solo farming. This is often referred to as a “Jump Run” because it usually entails jumping down from the entrance into the bottom level of the Warpwood Quarter to skip much of the tougher trash at the top. After making the jump, players must navigate carefully in order to avoid the larger packs that are too strong for one player alone. Different classes may be able to take on different mobs alone, including some bosses, sometimes with the help of a ledge or reset spot.

There are a number of items that can be farmed solo here, depending on your class and professions:

* **Warpwood Pods:** These are curled up pods on the ground that can be looted for:
  + [Runn Tum Tuber](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18255) (used to make [Runn Tum Tuber Surprise](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18254), the only Intellect food in the game)
  + [Thornling Seed](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18297) (a useful bind-on-pickup item, particularly for classes that don’t have a pet)
* There are [Herbalism](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/herbalism-1-300/) nodes throughout the instance that can be picked for [Dreamfoil](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13463), [Ghost Mushroom](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/8845), and [Gromsblood](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/8846)
* There are always 2-3 **Rich Thorium Veins** to be found behind [Alzzin the Wildshaper](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/dire-maul-east/alzzin-the-wildshaper) for characters with [Mining](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/mining-1-300/), which can contain [Arcane Crystal](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12363)s as well as [Thorium Ore](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/10620), [Dense Stone](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12365), [Elemental Earth](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7067), [Elemental Fire](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/7068), or various gems
* Characters with [Enchanting](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/enchanting-1-300/) can [Disenchant](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/13262) boss drops and other loot for high level Enchanting materials
* **Dusty Tomes** can spawn on the ground around the dungeon, and may contain class books that can be turned in for trinkets or the book for [Quel’Serrar](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/quelserrar-quest-guide/)
* **Lashers** are often farmed in the Conservatory since they can be killed in large numbers with AoE and drop a decent amount of junk that can be sold to a vendor for gold
* **Satyrs** can drop [Demonic Rune](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12662)s and [Felcloth](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/14256)

Hydrospawn in Dire Maul East


Bosses
------

There are six bosses in Dire Maul East, one of which can be summoned as part of a quest.

* [Pusilin](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/dire-maul-east/pusillin)
* [Lethtendris](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/dire-maul-east/lethtendris)
* [Hydrospawn](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/dire-maul-east/hydrospawn)
* [Zevrim Thornhoof](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/dire-maul-east/zevrim-thornhoof)
* [Alzzin the Wildshaper](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/dire-maul-east/alzzin-the-wildshaper)
* [Isalien](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/dire-maul-east/isalien) (Quest)

### Pusillin

Pusillin is a small imp boss who you will chase around the first section of Dire Maul East while talking to him. The level 56-57 elite imp drops the Crescent Key, which should be attained at some point by all players in order to access the rest of Dire Maul. Make it easy for your group to see the small NPC and mark him.

[![pusilin](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Pusilin.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Pusilin.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Engage the boss and generate aggro on Pusillin and his Wildspawn Imps as best you can at the very beginning of the fight. Your DPS may pull one or more of the smaller imps off of you, but in general focus on managing Pusillin.
* **Healer:** Healing this fight may be challenging in the beginning as DPS may get aggro on one or more of the Wildspawn Imps. Luckily they won’t live long, but use any HoTs or healing increasing abilities at the beginning of the fight.
* **Damage Dealers:** Melee and Ranged DPS should focus on killing the four Wildspawn Imps that Pusillin will cast when engaged. Use any interrupts available to keep Pusillin from using his [Fireball](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/15228) and [Blast Wave](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/22424) abilities. Caster DPS be aware that while buffed with Pusillin’s [Spirit of Runn Tum](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/22735), he has a 50% chance to reflect spells back at the caster. Warlocks can enslave the adds that are summoned during the fight.

#### Loot

* [Crescent Key](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18249)
* [Recipe: Runn Tum Tuber Surprise](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18267)

### Lethtendris

Lethendris is a Blood Elf Warlock who is joined by her demon imp minion, Plimgib. The boss’s spells can be interrupted so pay close attention to your party members and she will not be much of an issue.

[![lethtendris](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Lethtendris.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Lethtendris.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Engage the boss and focus on establishing threat on Lethendris. Use a [Taunt](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/355) ability to keep Plimgib off of your Healer or DPS, but the imp will not live for very long.
* **Healer:** Use any heal over time effects on your party members and rotate through healing them while focusing the Tank. All members of the group will be taking some damage from [Shadow Bolt Volley](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/17228), since [Void Bolt](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/22709) is the primary concern to interrupt. Dispel the DoT effect from [Immolate](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12742). Decurse [Curse of Tongues](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/13338) and [Curse of Thorns](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/16247) if you are a Resto Druid.
* **Damage Dealers:** Focus on killing Pimgib first, then switch the Lethendris. Use any interrupts available on her [Void Bolt](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/22709), [Shadow Bolt Volley](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/17228), and [Immolate](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12742) spells in that priority. Mages and Druids decurse her [Curse of Tongues](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/13338) and [Curse of Thorns](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/16247).

#### Loot

* [Band of Vigor](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18302)
* [Felhide Cap](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18325)
* [Lethtendris’s Wand](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18301)
* [Pimgib’s Collar](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18354)
* [Quel’dorai Channeling Rod](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/18311)

### Hydrospawn

Hydrospawn is a water elemental who is found in the next lowest level of Dire Maul East from the previous bosses. The elemental patrols a pool and fountain surrounded by adds which you should clear before engaging him. The boss spawns Hydroling adds which deal a surprising amount of damage for their size and need to be managed efficiently in order to defeat the boss.

Mages seek to defeat Hydrospawn to obtain the elemental’s essence for their level 55 water quest, Arcane Refreshment. It is not unheard of for experienced level 60 players (especially Warlocks and Hunters) to solo this boss as a service for their Mage friends.

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Agree on a strategy with your DPS for handling the Hydroling adds as they are summoned; either focus them down as they spawn or focus on Hydrospawn and handle the adds after. It is generally recommended to focus the adds if your group has a strong AoE abilities, and to focus down Hydrospawn if you have strong single target burst damage in your DPS group.
* **Healer:** The Hydroling adds deal a considerable amount of damage while they are alive. Focus on spreading your healing throughout the group while focusing the Tank when they spawn.
* **Damage Dealers:** Agree on a strategy with the Tank for handling the Hydroling adds as they are summoned; either focus them down as they spawn or focus on Hydrospawn and handle the adds after. It is generally recommended to focus the adds if your group has a strong AoE abilities, and to focus down Hydrospawn if you have strong single target burst damage in your DPS group.

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Maintain the primary threat position during the fight.
* **Healer:** Whoever is sent to the sacrificial alter will mandate some significant healing attention. Use whatever abilities you have to ensure that your party members survive. Dispel the [Intense Pain](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/22478) debuff from you party members if possible.
* **Damage Dealers:** Focus your DPS output on the boss while making sure not to overtake the primary threat position. You may be teleported to the sacrificial alter during the fight. If you are a Paladin or a Mage you can use Divine Shield or Ice Block to get out of this. Ranged DPS. Should stand at maximum distance to get out of range from Intense Pain. Warlocks can enslave one of the Wildspawn Hellcaller or Wildspawn Shadowstalker to fight against Zevrim, these mobs are considerably stronger than your minions. If you can, Dispel the multi-target Intense Pain debuff.

#### Loot

### Alzzin the Wildshaper

Alzzin the Wildshaper is the shapeshifting final boss of Dire Maul East, taking on the forms of a Satyr, a Dire Wolf, and a Treant throughout the fight. If you do not clear all of the Warpwood Crushers from the ramp on the way down to fight Alzzin, they will engage along with the boss and come make your encounter a lot more difficult. Do not exit the instance without entering the tunnel behind Alzzin and mining the Rich Thorium Veins, which are consistently located here.

[![alzzin the wildshaper](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Alzzin-the-Wildshaper.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Alzzin-the-Wildshaper.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Alzzin drops threat every time he changes form, so use threat generating abilities to reestablish yourself at the top of the threat meter.
* **Healer:** Your Tank is going to take the most damage when the boss is in Dire Wolf form, so try to keep them topped off at all times.
* **Damage Dealers:** Alzzin drops threat every time he shape shifts, so allow your tank generate enough threat to stay in the primary threat position. At 35% the boss will have adds joining the encounter – utilize AoE effects to burn them down before returning to Alzzin. Use [Sunder Armor](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11597) or [Expose Armor](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11198), especially when the boss is in Treant form.

### Isalien

Isalien can be summoned using the Brazier of Beckoning for the [Tier 0.5](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/tier-0-5/) questline in the space where Alzzin lies defeated. The boss is essentially a tank and spank, among the easiest of the questline.

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Maintain threat on the boss, and pick up her Hippogryph pet when it spawns.
* **Healer:** Keep your Tank topped off while being aware of any damage being taken by other players.
* **Damage Dealers:** When Isalien summons her Hippogryph, focus on damaging the add first then switch back to the boss. Interrupt her healing abilities as best as possible.
