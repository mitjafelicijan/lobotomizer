Scholomance is what’s left of Caer Darrow, once owned by Lord Alexei Barov and his family. Barov was betrayed by the nefarious wizard Kel’thuzad who tricked him into handing the crypts over to the Lich King to prove his loyalty. For Barov’s efforts, his family was slaughtered and the crypts are now dedicated to necromancy. Among what’s left of the ruins, you’ll find crazed cultists as you fight your way to the school’s headmaster, Darkmaster Gandling.

Location & Map
--------------

The entrance to the Scholomance dungeon is on the island of Caer Darrow in the southeastern part of the Western Plaguelands zone. Alliance can head east from Chillwind Camp while Horde will need to run from Tirisfal Glades. The door that blocks the dungeon portal must be opened with the [Skeleton Key](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13704), which is acquired from a lengthy quest chain in Western Plaguelands.

There is also one key required to progress through the dungeon, the [Viewing Room Key](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13873), which must be looted from [Rattlegore](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scholomance/rattlegore).

### Wow Alliance Crest Alliance Quests

#### [The Key to Scholomance](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5505)

* **Shareable:** No
* **Level Required:** 55
* **Chain Start:** [Commander Ashlam Valorfist](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/10838) at Chillwind Camp in Western Plaguelands
* **Quest Start:** [Alchemist Arbington](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11056) at Chillwind Camp in Western Plaguelands
* **Finish:** [Alchemist Arbington](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11056) at Chillwind Camp in Western Plaguelands
* **Objectives:** Speak with [Alchemist Arbington](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11056)
* **Rewards:**
  + 9950 experience
  + [Skeleton Key](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13704)

This quest chain does not take you inside the dungeon, but it does require a group and gives you the key you’ll need to open the door.

There are three possible breadcrumb quests that can lead you to Chillwind Camp, but which are not required to start this chain:

* [A Call to Arms: The Plaguelands!](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5066) from [Crier Goodman](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/2198) in Stormwind City
* [A Call to Arms: The Plaguelands!](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5090) from [Courier Hammerfall](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/10877) in Ironforge
* [A Call to Arms: The Plaguelands!](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5091) from [Herald Moonstalker](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/10878) in Darnassus

After locating [Commander Ashlam Valorfist](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/10838) at Chillwind Camp in Western Plaguelands (which you can reach by running north from Hillsbrad Foothills through Alterac Mountains), pick up the quest [Clear the Way](http://v), which starts this chain. You’ll need to kill 10 [Skeletal Flayer](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/1783)s and 10 [Slavering Ghoul](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/1791)s at Sorrow Hill across the road. Return to Ashlam and he’ll offer [All Along the Watchtowers](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5097). You’ll need to head north into the Ruins of Andorhal, a town that has been overrun with the Scourge and which is densely packed with high level undead. Look for each of the four towers in the corners of town and stand in the doorway to use the [Beacon Torch](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12815) you were given. Then return to Ashlam to pick up [Scholomance](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5533). That quest simply points you to [Alchemist Arbington](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11056) right next to Ashlam. Speak with him to move on to [Skeletal Fragments](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5537). Then go kill some Skeletal mobs, which you can find at Sorrow Hill, Andorhal, or the farms to the north, to loot 15 [Skeletal Fragments](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/14619). Bring these back to Alchemist Arbington to proceed to [Mold Rhymes With…](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5538)

Now you’ll need to do a bit of running around and spend some gold. You must bring 15 gold to [Krinkle Goodsteel](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/5411) at Gadgetzan in Tanaris. He’ll give you the quest [Fire Plume Forged](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5801), for which you will need to bring 2 [Thorium Bar](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12359)s to Fire Plume Ridge in the center of Un’Goro Crater. Head all the way up to the lava lake at the top (the liquid lava, not the red ground you’ll see elsewhere). Stand beside it and use the [Unfinished Skeleton Key](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/14645).

Head back to [Alchemist Arbington](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11056) at Chillwind Camp in Western Plaguelands to progress to the quest [Araj’s Scarab](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5803). You’ll need to make your way north into the Ruins of Andorhal again, and this time you’ll definitely need a group. You must defeat [Araj the Summoner](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/1852), a level 61 elite in the center of town who is surrounded by other undead mobs (some of whom are also elites). Once he’s dead, right-click on [Araj’s Phylactery](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/177241) to loot [Araj’s Scarab](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/14610). Then return to Alchemist Arbington and wait for him to finish talking. You can then complete the quest [The Key to Scholomance](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5505), which will grant you the [Skeleton Key](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13704) that is required to open the door to the dungeon.

#### [Barov Family Fortune](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5343)

* **Shareable:** Yes
* **Level Required:** 52
* **Start:** [Weldon Barov](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11023) at Chillwind Camp in Western Plaguelands
* **Finish:** [Weldon Barov](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11023) at Chillwind Camp in Western Plaguelands
* **Objectives:** Collect the 4 deeds that make up the family fortune inside Scholomance
* **Rewards:**

  + 1 gold 80 silver

This quest requires you to collect 4 deeds that can be found as clickable scrolls in specific places throughout the Scholomance dungeon:

* [The Deed to Southshore](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13450) is in the first large room of the dungeon, The Reliquary, on a table in the back left corner from the entrance (northeast on the minimap).
* [The Deed to Tarren Mill](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13451) is in the large room you enter after passing through the Chamber of Summoning. It’s once again on a table in the opposite corner from where you enter (southwest this time).
* [The Deed to Brill](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13471) is in the Laboratory near [Ras Frostwhisper](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scholomance/ras-frostwhisper), on the western wall further toward the back of the room from the Alchemy Lab.
* [The Deed to Caer Darrow](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13448) is in the Barov Family Vault at the very end of the dungeon, on a slab beside [Lord Alexei Barov](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scholomance/lord-alexei-barov).

After you hand in the deeds, you’ll have the opportunity to complete another quest, [The Last Barov](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5344), which requires you to enter Horde territory and awards you with a [Barov Peasant Caller](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/14023).

### Horde Quests

#### [The Key to Scholomance](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5511)

* **Shareable:** No
* **Level Required:** 55
* **Chain Start:** [High Executor Derrington](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/10837) at The Bulwark in Tirisfal Glades
* **Quest Start:** [Apothecary Dithers](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11057) at The Bulwark in Tirisfal Glades
* **Finish:** [Apothecary Dithers](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11057) at The Bulwark in Tirisfal Glades
* **Objectives:** Speak with [High Executor Derrington](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/10837)
* **Rewards:**
  + 9950 experience
  + [Skeleton Key](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13704)

This quest chain does not take you inside the dungeon, but it does require a group and gives you the key you’ll need to open the door.

There are three possible breadcrumb quests that can lead you to The Bulwark, but which are not required to start this chain:

* [A Call to Arms: The Plaguelands!](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5095) from [Bluff Runner Windstrider](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/10881) in Thunder Bluff
* [A Call to Arms: The Plaguelands!](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5094) from [Harbinger Balthazad](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/10879) in Undercity
* [A Call to Arms: The Plaguelands!](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5093) from [Warcaller Gorlach](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5093) in Orgrimmar

After locating [High Executor Derrington](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/10837) at The Bulwark in Tirisfal Glades (easily reached by running east along the road from Undercity), pick up the quest [Scarlet Diversions](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5096), which starts this chain. **Before you leave, loot the [Box of Incendiaries](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/176092) next to him to get a [Flame in a Bottle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12814).** Then head east into Western Plaguelands and look for a small Scarlet Crusade camp northeast of Felstone Field, the first farm you come across. The camp is likely to be crawling with Scarlet mobs, which you’ll have to deal with in order to reach the tent. Right-click on the tent to burn it, and then right-click on the [Scourge Banner](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12807) in your bags to plant it. Then return to Derrington at The Bulwark to pick up [All Along the Watchtowers](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5098).

Now you’ll need to head back into Western Plaguelands and find the Ruins of Andorhal, a town south of the main road that has been overrun with Scourge. This area is densely packed with high level undead. Look for each of the four towers in the corners of town and stand in the doorway to use the [Beacon Torch](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12815) you were given. Then return to Derrington to pick up [Scholomance](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/838). This quest simply points you to [Apothecary Dithers](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11057) a few meters away. Speak with him to move on to [Skeletal Fragments](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/964). Then go kill some Skeletal mobs in Western Plaguelands, which you can find at the farms north of the road or in the Ruins of Andorhal, to loot 15 [Skeletal Fragments](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/14619). Bring these back to Apothecary Dithers to proceed to [Mold Rhymes With…](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5514)

Now you’ll need to do a bit of running around and spend some gold. You must bring 15 gold to [Krinkle Goodsteel](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/5411) at Gadgetzan in Tanaris. He’ll give you the quest [Fire Plume Forged](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5802), for which you will need to bring 2 [Thorium Bar](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12359)s to Fire Plume Ridge in the center of Un’Goro Crater. Head all the way up to the lava lake at the top (the liquid lava, not the red ground you’ll see elsewhere). Stand beside it and use the [Unfinished Skeleton Key](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/14645).

Head back to [Apothecary Dithers](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11057) at The Bulwark in Tirisfal Glades to progress the quest to [Araj’s Scarab](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5804). You’ll need to make your way north into the Ruins of Andorhal again, and this time you’ll definitely need a group. You must defeat [Araj the Summoner](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/1852), a level 61 elite in the center of town who is surrounded by other undead mobs (some of whom are also elites). Once he’s dead, right-click on [Araj’s Phylactery](https://wowclassicdb.com/object/177241) to loot [Araj’s Scarab](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/14610). Then return to Apothecary Dithers and wait for him to finish talking. You can then complete the quest [The Key to Scholomance](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5511), which will grant you the [Skeleton Key](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13704) that is required to open the door to the dungeon.

* **Quest Start:** [Betina Bigglezink](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11035) at Light’s Hope Chapel in Eastern Plaguelands
* **Finish:** [Betina Bigglezink](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11035) at Light’s Hope Chapel in Eastern Plaguelands

    - [Dancing Sliver](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/15854)
    - [Windreaper](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/15853)

This lengthy chain begins at Flame Crest in Burning Steppes, a Horde flight location that has neutral NPCs. [Tinkee Steamboil](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/10267) offers the quest [Egg Freezing](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/4734), which requires entering the [Upper Blackrock Spire](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/upper-blackrock-spire) dungeon. When you get to The Rookery, the room full of dragon eggs, carefully approach the eggs and right-click the [Eggscilloscope Prototype](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12286), and then you’ll be able to click on a Rookery Egg and freeze it. You don’t need to get super close to reach them, so stay back so you don’t accidentally hatch them and summon a bunch of whelps. Return to Tinkee at Flame Crest and she’ll give you another quest that must be done in The Rookery (if you have a patient group, you can knock both out in one run). [Egg Collection](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/4735) requires you to use the [Eggscilloscope Prototype](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12286) again to freeze eggs, and then collect them with the [Collectronic Module](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12287). Collect 8 eggs this way and head back to Tinkee once more.

She’ll give you the quest [Leonid Barthalomew](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5522), for which you must locate [Leonid Barthalomew the Revered](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11036) at Light’s Hope Chapel in Eastern Plaguelands. He’ll give you the quest [Betina Bigglezink](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5531), pointing you to the NPC of that name ([Betina Bigglezink](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11035)) outside. She offers the final quest, [Dawn’s Gambit](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/4771), which sends you to Scholomance at last. Head there and make your way to The Viewing Room, the large room where all of the neutral Scholomance Students are standing around. Use the [Dawn’s Gambit](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/12368) in your bag to place it on the ground and then defeat the boss [Vectus](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scholomance/vectus). Return to Betina at Light’s Hope Chapel to receive your reward.

Start by heading to Caer Darrow, the island in the middle of the lake in Western Plaguelands. [Eva Sarkhoff](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11216) is a ghost standing outside the entrance to Scholomance. She offers this quest, which requires you to enter the dungeon. **Don’t kill [Kirtonos the Herald](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scholomance/kirtonos-the-herald) or [Jandice Barov](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scholomance/jandice-barov) yet if you wish to continue the quest chain without starting a new dungeon run.** Kill [Doctor Theolen Krastinov](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scholomance/doctor-theolen-krastinov), one of the last bosses in the instance.

* **Quest Start:** [Magistrate Marduke](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11286) at Caer Darrrow in Western Plaguelands
* **Finish:** [Magistrate Marduke](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11286) at Caer Darrrow in Western Plaguelands
* **Objectives:** Obtain the [Human Head of Ras Frostwhisper](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13626) from [Ras Frostwhisper](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scholomance/ras-frostwhisper) inside Scholomance
* **Rewards:**

  + Pick one of:
    - [Crown of Caer Darrow](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13986)
    - [Darrowspike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13984)
    - [Warblade of Caer Darrow](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13982)

After completing the quest above, you’ll need to complete a few more before you will reach this last quest in the chain, one of which must be completed inside the [Stratholme (Undead)](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/stratholme-undead) dungeon.

You must now equip the [Spectral Essence](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13544) you just obtained from the last quest in order to see [Magistrate Marduke](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11286), who is standing close to the Sarkhoffs right outside Scholomance. Talk to him to start the next quest, [The Human, Ras Frostwhisper](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5461). Then head to the Arathi Highlands zone, to Stromgarde Keep in the southwest. You’re looking for a red book, [Keepsake of Remembrance](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13585), which will be found in front of a fireplace in one of the ruined buildings. Its location is random, so you may have to do a bit of exploring before you find it.

Bring the book back to Magistrate Marduke to progress to the next quest, [The Dying, Ras Frostwhisper](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5462). Now locate [Leonid Barthalomew the Revered](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/11036) inside Light’s Hope Chapel in Eastern Plaguelands. He offers the next quest, [Menethil’s Gift](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5463). This quest requires you to enter the [Stratholme (Undead)](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/stratholme-undead) dungeon and make your way to [Baron Rivendare](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/stratholme-undead/baron-rivendare), the last boss. There you can click on Menethil’s Gift, the glowing symbol on the ground in front of the boss, to get the next quest (also called [Menethil’s Gift](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5464)). Return to Leonid Barthalomew at Light’s Hope Chapel to turn this in and move on to [Soulbound Keepsake](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5465). Then head back to Magistrate Marduke outside Scholomance to pick up the final quest of the chain, [The Lich, Ras Frostwhisper](https://wowclassicdb.com/quest/5466).

Enter Scholomance again and make your way to The Laboratory, where you’ll find the boss [Ras Frostwhisper](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/scholomance/ras-frostwhisper). **Don’t just kill him in his lich form or you will be unable to complete the quest.** Use the [Soulbound Keepsake](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13752) in your bag to transform him into a human. This requires a 10-second channel, which can be tricky to complete since he casts both a fear and a knockback. It also means that your group will need to be able to manage without you for the duration of the channel. Once the channel has been completed, he’ll transform and fully heal himself. You can then kill him in his human form. He still has all of the same abilities and mechanics. Kill him to loot the [Human Head of Ras Frostwhisper](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13626) and return to Magistrate Marduke for your reward.

### Kirtonos the Herald

Kirtonos the Herald is a level 60 elite boss who can be summoned on the patio using the Blood of Innocents, looted from the Blood Steward of Kirtonos. The boss transforms between Gargoyle and Human forms during the fight. While in human form he will cast curses on the group, while in gargoyle form the fight is a tank and spank.

[![kirtonos the herald](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kirtonos-the-Herald.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kirtonos-the-Herald.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Tank the boss with your back to a wall to avoid being thrown around by his knockback abilities, and to keep your other party members out of [Swoop](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/18144) range. Whenever the boss changes form, makes sure to initiate and establish threat to keep the boss focused on you.
* **Healer:** Healing this fight should not require you to take your attention away from the tank, unless DPS are being affected by positional abilities. Always try to keep everyone topped off.
* **Damage Dealers:** During this fight, DPS should avoid being in front of Kirtonos in Gargoyle phase to avoid the [Wing Flap](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/12882) knockback and the stun from [Swoop](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/18144). Mages and Druids should decurse any cursed party members.

#### Loot

* [Boots of Valor](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/16734)
* [Clutch of Andros](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13956)
* [Frightalon](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/14024)

* [Stoneform Shoulders](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13955)
* [Windreaver Greaves](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/13967)

### Jandice Barov

Jandice is an optional, level 61 elite, boss located below the Plagued Whelpling room in Scholomance. Use the torch on the south wall to open up access to her chamber. The encounter with Jandice can be tricky, so make sure to clear the area around her of all adds to keep your focus on the boss. Jandice summons illusions of herself during the fight, so mark the boss to keep a sense of which copy is actually her. Make sure to click on the torch on the side wall to access extra secret loot later in the dungeon.

[![jandice barov](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Jandice-Barov.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Jandice-Barov.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Mark the boss with an icon so that you can easily pick up the real version of her when she summons her illusions. Maintain threat especially when the illusions are summoned.
* **Healer:** Be sure to cleanse [Dark Plague](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/18270) and decurse [Curse of Blood](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/24673) whenever possible. Stay in the back of the room during the fight as to avoid being involved with any of the illusions when they are summoned.
* **Damage Dealers:** Allow for your tank to establish threat, and begin dealing damage to the boss. When she summons illusory images of herself, spread out and hold DPS until the true version of her is clearly identified. Then focus your output on the boss.

#### Loot

* [Barovian Family Sword](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/14541)

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Mark the add as the primary target, and focus on Rattlegore second. Pull both of them out of their room and to the bottom of the stairs. Keep your back to a wall to avoid being thrown around by [Knock Away](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/18945).
* **Healer:** Focus your healing on the tank, as they will be taking significant damage especially at the beginning of the encounter when the add is still alive. Keep your distance to avoid being hit by [War Stomp](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11876).
* **Damage Dealers:** Focus your DPS output on the add before switching over to the boss. Be extra aware of your threat level, as Rattlegore can easily deal significant damage to players with low armor class. If you are a ranged DPS, keep your distance to avoid being hit by [War Stomp](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11876).

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Tank the boss and maximize threat so the damage dealers can output maximum DPS.

### Lord Alexei Barov

Lord Alexei Barov is located on the lower center wing of the last room. He is arguably the hardest, if not the second hardest fight in Scholomance. The combination of his Unholy Aura and Veil of Shadow in addition to two linked adds can quickly overwhelm a healer, leading to deaths. If at all possible, adds should be CC’d and decursing of Veil of Shadow should be a priority. Burn Barov and then finish up the adds.

[![lord alexei barov](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Lord-Alexei-Barov.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Lord-Alexei-Barov.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Make sure that crowd controls plans are finalized before the pull. Controlling the adds makes the fight much easier. Keep aggro on all mobs but focus on Barov first to stem the party wide damage from [Unholy Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/17467).
* **Healer:** This is a challenging fight to heal. The constant effect of [Unholy Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/17467) caused a lot of party damage and slows cast speed. Priests can [Shackle Undead](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/10955) one of the adds and should keep it controlled until Barov is dead. Druids should be decursing [Veil of Shadow](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/17820) throughout the fight.
* **Damage Dealers:** This is a challenging fight and if able to use CC to control the adds, they should be managed throughout the fight until Barov is dead. Focus on Barov first to minimize the nasty effect of [Unholy Aura](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/17467). Druids and mages need to decurse [Veil of Shadow](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/17820) throughout the fight.

### The Ravenian

The Ravenian is located on the lower right wing of the last room. This is a very simple tank and spank fight with the only complication is if you don’t fully clear the room, you may get adds due to his Knock Away.

[![the ravenian](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/The-Ravenian.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/The-Ravenian.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Be aware of positioning because you will be flung around by [Knock Away](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11130). If you don’t clear the room it’s easy to accidentally get adds.
* **Healer:** Keep your distance to not be affected by [Knock Away](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11130). Make sure the tank stays up on health but it’s a simple fight.
* **Damage Dealers:** This is a very simple fight. Be aware of positioning because you can easily be flung into adds from [Knock Away](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/spell/11130).

### Lorekeeper Polkelt

Lorekeeper Polkelt is located on the upper left wing of the last room. He is a very squishy boss but the complication is that he almost certainly won’t be able to be pulled alone. There are many zombie mobs in this room and you usually get a few when pulling Polkelt. As long as you treat them the same way as other pulls it is easy to down him.

[![lorekeeper polkelt](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Lorekeeper-Polkelt.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Lorekeeper-Polkelt.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Polkelt will almost certainly come with multiple adds. Keep threat on all mobs and be prepared to absorb or avoid the exploding corpses.
* **Healer:** Keep your distance on the fight so that adds that die and explode don’t hurt you.
* **Damage Dealers:** Polkelt has very low health for a boss. He almost always comes with multiple adds though. Treat this pull similarly to the other pulls in this room. Keep your distance when mobs die to minimize explosion damage.

### Doctor Theolen Krastinov

Doctor Theolen Krastinov is located on the upper center wing of the last room. This boss can be especially lethal to lesser armored party members. At 50% health he will Enrage and will easily start one or two shotting those near him. Try to burn him down fast before too many party members die.

[![doctor theolen krastinov](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Doctor-Theolen-Krastinov.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Doctor-Theolen-Krastinov.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Be prepared to take extra damage in this fight. Krastinov hits very hard. At 50% he hits even harder so to help out plan on using some defensive cooldowns later into the fight.
* **Healer:** Absolutely always keep distance away from the boss. He can easily one shot cloth armored players. Watch the tank’s health as they will take a lot of damage. Damage dealers can be sacrified if they pull threat but if the tank dies it’ll probably be a wipe.
* **Damage Dealers:** Krastinov hits very hard. Make sure to not get aggro or you could easily be one shotted, especially if your armor is low. At 50% health he increases his attack speed, making him even more lethal.

### Instructor Malicia

Instructor Malicia is located on the upper right wing of the last room. She is an easy fight after dealing with the annoying adds before her. She is a heavy magic user and interrupts make the fight extremely simple.

[![instructor malicia](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Instructor-Malicia.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Instructor-Malicia.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** This is a tank and spank fight. Interrupt spells if possible.
* **Healer:** If the party is interrupting Malicia’s spells there’s very little damage that goes out on this fight.
* **Damage Dealers:** Malicia casts a lot of spells so interrupt as many as you can. Without casting spells she is very easy to kill and does little damage.

### Darkmaster Gandling

Darkmaster Gandling is the final boss of Scholomance, who spawns in the center of the Barov Family Vault upon the defeat of the 6 chamber bosses. He is the headmaster of Necromancy at Scholomance. Be aware that he enters the room soon after the final of the 6 bosses is defeated and will be engaged immediately upon exiting the wing. Gandling will periodically teleport a player into one of the surrounding chambers where they will need to fight a few non-elite mobs to make their way back to the group. Plan for the event that your Tank or Healer may be the one teleported.

[![darkmaster gangling](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Darkmaster-Gangling.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Darkmaster-Gangling.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Hold the boss in the middle of the room where he spawns. If you are teleported into one of the previous rooms, kill the adds present and rejoin the encounter.
* **Healer:** Focus healing output on your Tank. If you are teleported into one of the previous rooms, kill the adds present and rejoin the encounter.
* **Damage Dealers:** Melee DPS should focus their damage output on the boss without overtaking the primary threat position. Ranged DPS should stand on the stairs and damage the boss from maximum range. If you are teleported into one of the previous rooms, kill the adds present as quickly as possible and rejoin the encounter.

I've been playing World of Warcraft on and off since vanilla, usually as a healer or caster and often as a guild leader. I play both retail and classic. I also love RPGs, sandboxes, and sims.
