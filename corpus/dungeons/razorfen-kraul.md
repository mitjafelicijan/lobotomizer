Razorfen Kraul was created when the demigod boar Agamaggan fell in battle. His blood created several thorny vine areas in the southern parts of The Barrens. You’ll find endless amounts of quilboars in this dungeon, as they are rumored to be descendants of Agamaggan himself.

------

* [Roogug](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/razorfen-kraul/roogug)
* [Aggem Thorncurse](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/razorfen-kraul/aggem-thorncurse)
* [Death Speaker Jargba](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/razorfen-kraul/death-speaker-jargba)
* [Overlord Ramtusk](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/razorfen-kraul/overlord-ramtusk)
* [Earthcaller Halmgar](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/razorfen-kraul/earthcaller-halmgar) (Rare)
* [Agathelos the Raging](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/razorfen-kraul/agathelos-the-raging)
* [Blind Hunter](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/razorfen-kraul/blind-hunter) (Rare)
* [Charlga Razorflank](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/razorfen-kraul/charlga-razorflank)

### [Roogug](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/razorfen-kraul/roogug)

Roogug is the first boss you will encounter in Razorfen Kraul. He is a level 28 elite Quillboar shaman. He is accompanied by a Death’s Head Seer and a Stone Rumbler elemental that he summons.

[![roogug](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Roogug.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Roogug.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Make sure you have marked the mobs so everyone in your group knows which one to attack, which one to crowd control, etc. Use your AoE abilities to hold threat on secondary targets while your group kills the primary target. The Death’s Head Seer is the most dangerous, so mark him with a skull.
* **Healer:** Wait a few moments before you cast your healing spells when the fight begins, or you may pull threat on the adds. You will need to react quickly if one of the DPS players gets aggro on one of the mobs and starts taking damage, as they can die very quickly.
* **Damage Dealers:** If your group is using CC on the adds, ignore them and damage Roogug. If your group is not crowd controlling the adds, focus them down first, starting with the Death’s Head Seer. Pay close attention to your threat, as your tank might struggle to hold aggro on 3 different mobs.

#### Loot

* None

### [Aggem Thorncurse](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/razorfen-kraul/aggem-thorncurse)

Aggem Thorncurse is the second boss you will encounter in Razorfen Kraul. He is a level 30 elite Quillboar beast master. He will repeatedly summon boar spirits to aid him in combat throughout the encounter.

[![aggem thorncurse](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Aggem-Thorncurse.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Aggem-Thorncurse.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** The spirit boars that Aggem summons have very low HP, so there is no point trying to build threat on them. If they run towards a healer, consider taunting it off of them, but other than that build as much threat as you can on the boss.
* **Healer:** If you get aggro on one of the summoned spirit boars, run towards the tank and melee DPS so they can kill it for you.
* **Damage Dealers:** Quickly switch your focus to the boar spirits that Aggem summons and kill them – they have very low HP.

#### Loot

* [Thornspike](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6681)

### [Death Speaker Jargba](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/razorfen-kraul/death-speaker-jargba)

Death Speaker Jargba is the third boss you will encounter in Razorfen Kraul. He is a level 30 elite Quillboar shadow caster. He is accompanied by a Death’s Head Acolyte and a Razorfen Groundshaker.

![death speaker jargba](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Death-Speaker-Jargba.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Let your DPS players deal with the Death’s Head Acolyte while you build threat on the Razorfen Groundshaker and Jargba himself. Keep the Razorgen Groundshaker and Jargba himself away from your healer, so they cannot be affected by their stun and mind control abilities. Jargba will spam his Shadow Bolt ability if nobody is within his melee range, causing him to deal a lot more damage. So make sure you’re always close to him.
* **Healer:** Stay far away from the Razorfen Groundshaker in order to avoid his AoE stun. Stay far away from Death Speaker Jargba in order to avoid being targeted by his Dominate Mind ability. Priest and shaman healers can use Dispel Magic and Purge respectively to dispel Jargba’s Dominate Mind.
* **Damage Dealers:** Kill the Death’s Head Acolyte first, then the Razorfen Groundshaker, and finally Jargba himself. Interrupt the Death’s Head Acolyte’s Mana Burn cast.

### [Overlord Ramtusk](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/razorfen-kraul/overlord-ramtusk)

Overlord Ramtusk is the fourth boss you will encounter in Razorfen Kraul. He is a level 32 elite Quillboar warrior. He is accompanied by two Razorfen Spearhides.

[![overlord ramtusk](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Overlord-Ramtusk.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Overlord-Ramtusk.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Make sure you have marked the mobs so everyone in your group knows which one to attack, which one to crowd control, etc. Use your AoE abilities to hold threat on secondary targets while your group kills the primary target, which should be marked skull. Pull the Razorfen Spearhides away from your healer and casters, as their Whirling Barrage AoE ability deals a lot of damage.
* **Healer:** Wait a few moments before you cast your healing spells when the fight begins, or you may pull aggro. There is a high likelihood that several of your DPS players will be hit by the Spearhides’ Whirling Barrage AoE ability. It deals a moderate amount of damage, so you will need to be quick with healing them in that event. Make sure you’re far away from the Spearhides, so you don’t get hit by the Whirling Barrage yourself – it can kill you very easily.
* **Damage Dealers:** If your group is using crowd control on the adds, ignore them and damage Ramtusk. If your group is not crowd controlling the adds, focus them down first, starting with the mob that was marked skull. Pay close attention to your threat, as your tank might struggle to hold aggro on 3 different mobs. Melee DPS should move away from the Spearhides while they are doing their spinning animation, signifying that they are about to cast their powerful Whirling Barrage AoE spell.

### [Earthcaller Halmgar](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/razorfen-kraul/earthcaller-halmgar) (Rare)

Earthcaller Halmgar is a rare spawn boss you can encounter in Razorfen Kraul. You can find him in one of the plateaus after the Overlord Ramtusk encounter. He is a level 32 elite Quillboar shaman. He is accompanied by his Stone Rumbler summon.

[![earthcaller halmgar](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Earthcaller-Halmgar.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Earthcaller-Halmgar.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Focus your threat on Earthcaller Halmgar. His Stone Rumbler add doesn’t deal a lot of damage and dies quickly, so your DPS players can deal with it. Interrupt Lightning Bolt as much as you can.
* **Healer:** This fight is not very healing intensive, so you could help with DPS to take down Halmgar faster.
* **Damage Dealers:** If your group has a warlock who can Banish the Stone Rumbler, focus on Halmgar. Otherwise quickly kill the Rumbler before switching to Halmgar. Quickly destroy Halmgar’s totems – they have very little HP. Interrupt Lightning Bolt as much as you can.

#### Loot

* [Whisperwind Headdress](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6688)
* [Wind Spirit Staff](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6689)

### [Agathelos the Raging](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/razorfen-kraul/agathelos-the-raging)

Agathelos the Raging is the fifth boss you will encounter in Razorfen Kraul. He is a level 33 elite Boar. Before you can fight him, you must first defeat the mobs that are keeping him sealed: a Death’s Head Seer and 2 Ward Guardians.

[![agathelos the raging](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Agathelos-the-Raging.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Agathelos-the-Raging.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Be prepared to use a potion or healthstone if you ever find yourself dropping low on health. Agathelos does a very high amount of damage, and an unlucky crit can kill you even at relatively high health. Be sure to stay in melee range of Agathelos to avoid his Rushing Charge ability. If he seems to randomly die before his HP reaches 0, he is feigning death. You need to keep dealing damage to him, or else he will come back stronger.
* **Healer:** Agathelos deals a very high amount of damage, so keeping the tank alive will be your number 1 priority. Only heal other players if the tank is looking healthy. Be sure to stay in melee range of Agathelos to avoid his Rushing Charge ability.
* **Damage Dealers:** He deals a very high amount of damage, so be very careful to not overtake your tank on threat. Be sure to stay in melee range of Agathelos even if you are a caster to avoid his Rushing Charge ability. If he seems to randomly die before his HP reaches 0, he is feigning death. You need to keep dealing damage to him, or else he will come back stronger.

#### Loot

* [Ferine Leggings](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6690)
* [Swinetusk Shank](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6691)

### [Blind Hunter](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/razorfen-kraul/blind-hunter) (Rare)

Blind Hunter is a rare spawn boss you can encounter in Razorfen Kraul. You can find him at the end of the cave complex, after the Agathelos the Raging encounter. It is a level 32 elite Bat.

[![blind hunter](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Blind-Hunter.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Blind-Hunter.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Before you engage Blind Hunter, make sure you have killed any nearby bats, to avoid pulling them by accident during the encounter. You are going to get stunned occasionally, possibly losing threat while stunned. Quickly Taunt Blind Hunter and move it away from your casters and healer, so they don’t get silenced.
* **Healer:** Stay as far away from Blind Hunter as possible to avoid being silenced by Sonic Burst. The silence lasts 10 seconds, so it is very possible that someone dies while you are silenced. Dispel the silence off any casters in your group that got hit by it by accident.
* **Damage Dealers:** Casters should stay away from Blind Hunter to avoid being repeatedly silenced by Sonic Burst. Your tank will get stunned periodically and be unable to deal threat, making it possible that you get aggro instead. Be very mindful of this.

#### Loot

* [Batwing Mantle](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6697)
* [Nightstalker Bow](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6696)
* [Stygian Bone Amulet](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6695)

### [Charlga Razorflank](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/razorfen-kraul/charlga-razorflank)

Charlga Razorflank is the sixth and final boss you will encounter in Razorfen Kraul. She is a level 33 elite Quillboar priestess.

[![charlga razorflank](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Charlga-Razorflank.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Charlga-Razorflank.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Tank Charlga in the middle of the ramp outside her hut. She teleports back to her hut occasionally, so you will have to be quick with grabbing her again.
* **Healer:** Stand away from other players to avoid getting hit by her Chain Bolt ability. Your melee DPS will need healing throughout this fight, as they will likely get hit by her Chain Bolt repeatedly.
* **Damage Dealers:** Ranged DPS should stay far away from other players in the group to avoid chaining Charlga’s Chain Bolt. Do not bother applying any magical debuffs or DoTs on Charlga. She will constantly dispel all of them with her Purity spell. She is invulnerable to all damage while Purity is active.

#### Loot

* [Agamaggan’s Clutch](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6693)
* [Heart of Agamaggan](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6694)
