Shadowfang Keep is the dungeon that used to be Baron Silverlain’s noble keep. It is a result of the Archmage Arugal summoning worgen to protect Dalaran, who in turn ravaged the keep. Now Arugal lives in the keep with the worgen as his pets, but you can also find the ghost of Baron Silverlaine in this spooky castle.

Quests
------

There are only 3 quests in Shadowfang Keep:

| Quest Name | Acquired From | Shareable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Deathstalkers in Shadowfang](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/quest/1098) | [High Executor Hadrec](https://wowclassicdb.com/npc/1952) (Silverpine Forest) | Yes |

Shadowfang Keep only has a handful of quests, and all of them are exclusive to Horde players. It is also one of the few early dungeons with no quest chains, meaning you can grab all available quests right off the bat and they can all be shared with other players.

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Rethilgore is a boss encounter that requires proper use of defensive mechanics and tactical maneuvering. Tanks should focus on maintaining threat as much as possible in order for the Damage Dealers to go all-out. Bleak Words can severely dampen the casting and attack speed of players with Wavering Will. Tanks should especially beware of Soul Drain as it can cause heavy injuries. Rethilgore is accompanied by adds, you should focus on maintaining aggro on them while your damage dealers kill the adds.
* **Healer:** Rethilgore is a boss encounter that requires proper use of defensive mechanics and tactical maneuvering. Healers should manage their mana, as Rethilgore deals high amounts of damage to the tank. Due to Wavering Will, healers should maintain the whole party’s health pool, as casting can become difficult with the debuff.
* **Damage Dealers:** Rethilgore is a boss encounter that requires proper use of defensive mechanics and tactical maneuvering. Rethilgore is accompanied by adds that should be focused on first. Due to Wavering Will, players should manage their resources, as dealing damage can become difficult.

#### Loot

* [Rugged Spaulders](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/5254)

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should focus on doing as much threat as possible on the boss, so the DPS can go all-out.

#### Loot

* [Baron’s Scepter](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6323)

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Commander Springvale can be a difficult fight, the boss encounter takes place in a room filled with mobs that need to be dealt with first.

Wailing Guardsman casts Screams of the Past ability that tanks should be careful of and when the boss reaches 30% health points, he will cast Divine Shield on himself and immediately after Holy Light. Holy Light can be interrupted, as Commander Springvale is casting the ability while under the influence of Divine Shield.
* **Healer:** Commander Springvale can be a difficult fight, the boss encounter takes place in a room filled with mobs that need to be dealt with first. Healers should focus on preserving their mana as much as possible while also keeping the party alive. Healers should also beware of Screams of the Past, as it can prove to be deadly.
* **Damage Dealers:** Commander Springvale can be a difficult fight. The boss encounter takes place in a room filled with mobs that need to be dealt with first. Damage dealers should focus on dealing with the adds as fast as possible in order to ease the fight. Damage Dealers should beware of Screams of the Past cast by the guardsmen as it can severely hinder their performance in the fight.

#### Loot

* [Arced War Axe](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/3191)

#### Strategy

* **Tank:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should focus on doing as much threat as possible on the boss, so the DPS can go all-out. Tanks should focus on keeping the threat of the Vile Bats while Damage Dealers cleave them. Odo the Blindwatcher casts Howling Rage throughout the fight, progressively gaining more attack power the lesser his health is.
* **Healer:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should focus your healing on the tank. Note that damage will ramp up throughout the fight, so start out conservatively so your mana can go the distance.
* **Damage Dealers:** This fight is a tank and spank so you should do as much damage as possible while watching your threat. Odo the Blindwatcher is accompanied by a group of Vile Bats, which damage dealers should focus down first.

[![archmage arugal](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Archmage-Arugal.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Archmage-Arugal.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Archmage Arugal can prove to be a difficult fight, the boss employs different spells, teleporting throughout his chamber and mind-controlling his enemies. Tanks should focus on maintaining aggro on Archmage Arugal at all times since his Void Bolt can be really dangerous for the other players. Shadow damage resistance can greatly aid you in this encounter, and will also reduce the strain on the healer. Arugal’s Curse cannot be dispelled. When your allies get mind-controlled, make sure to not attack them and instead only attempt to crowd control them.
* **Healer:** Archmage Arugal can prove to be a difficult fight. The boss employs different spells, teleporting throughout his chamber and mind-controlling his enemies. As a Healer, Archmage Arugal can prove to be a difficult encounter. Mana management will be the key for this encounter. Since Arugal’s Curse cannot be dispelled, you will need to provide healing for your damage dealers as well. When an ally is under the effect of Arugal’s Curse you should attempt to crowd control him.
* **Damage Dealers:** Archmage Arugal can prove to be a difficult fight. The boss employs different spells, teleporting throughout his chamber and mind-controlling his enemies. As a damage dealer you should focus on dishing out as much damage as possible, while keeping in mind that you might get mind controlled at any time. Archmage Arugal uses Void Bolt, a spell that deals high amounts of shadow damage and cannot be interrupted. When an allied damage dealer is afflicted by Arugal’s Curse make sure to crowd control them instead of dealing damage to them.

#### Loot

* [Belt of Arugal](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6392)
* [Meteor Shard](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6220)
* [Robes of Arugal](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/6324)

### [Sever](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/shadowfang-keep/sever#default) ([Scourge Invasion](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/scourge-invasion-event/))

Sever **only appears during the Scourge Invasion event** precluding the opening of [Naxxramas](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/naxxramas/). Make sure to get the loot off of this boss while he is available as it is a one-time event.

[![sever](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sever.png)](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sever.png)
#### Strategy

* **Tank:** Tanks need to make sure to take the hits from Sever as he is harder than most bosses in Shadowfang Keep. During the fight, he casts Intimidating Roar so leave room to maneuver him. When he is low on health he will enrage so make sure to save any defensive cooldowns until then.
* **Healer:** Sever hits tanks hard so make sure to keep them up but maintain mana supply as he will enrage at low health. Be prepared to do some quick saves on the tank as Sever also casts Intimidating Roar.
* **Damage Dealers:** Sever is a challenging boss that is a tank and spank for DPS. Make sure to have enough space to not pick up adds when he uses Intimidating Roar. Burst him down as he berserks at low life.

#### Loot

* [Abomination Skin Leggings](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/23173)
* [The Axe of Severing](https://warcraftdb.com/classic/item/23171)

I've been playing World of Warcraft on and off since vanilla, usually as a healer or caster and often as a guild leader. I play both retail and classic. I also love RPGs, sandboxes, and sims.
