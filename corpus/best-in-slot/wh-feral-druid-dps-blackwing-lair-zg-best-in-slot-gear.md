# Feral Druid DPS Best in Slot Gear Blackwing Lair & Zul'Gurub - WoW Classic Phase 4

Welcome to Wowhead's Phase 4 Best in Slot Gear list for Feral Druid DPS in WoW Classic. This guide will list the recommended gear for Feral Druid DPS from raids, dungeons, world bosses, PvP, professions, world drops, reputations, and instances.

Phase 4 Best In Slot Gear for Feral Druid DPS
---------------------------------------------

Below are shown two fully optimized gear sets for Feral DPS players in Phase 4 of WoW Classic. Both sets sample from all possible sources of PvE gear in Phase 4, including quest rewards, drops from both 5-man dungeons and raids, crafted gear, and BoE items. On top of these PvE options, the first set just below includes all available world boss loot and PvP gear as well, including Epic quality ranking gear and Battleground reputation rewards, and is therefore the absolute best possible gear set that can be assembled in Phase 4. As in Phase 1-2, Feral Druids who have the time available to grind out Rank 13 as well as Exalted reputation with all three Battleground factions will be rewarded with a significant power spike in both their bear tanking and cat DPS performance. Most notably, the 3-piece combination of the Rank 13 chest with the Rank 12 gloves and pants vastly outclasses all available PvE options in those slots, and will not be replaced until Phase 5! The same is true for [![Forest Stalker's Bracers](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_bracer_12.gif) Forest Stalker's Bracers](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19587/forest-stalkers-bracers) from Exalted [Silverwing Sentinels](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/faction=890/silverwing-sentinels) / [Warsong Outriders](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/faction=889/warsong-outriders) reputation, which has no competitive PvE alternatives until it is replaced by [![Qiraji Execution Bracers](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_bracer_13.gif) Qiraji Execution Bracers](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=21602/qiraji-execution-bracers) in Phase 5.

The second gear set below is a more accessible budget option for players who will not be able to put in the significant amount of playtime required for attaining Rank 12/13 or Exalted Battleground reputations. This set includes only Rare quality PvP rewards and requires attaining only Rank 8 in the Honor system, which should be much more accessible for the majority of players given the reduced ranking time. The set also excludes world boss drops, which require a similar level of time commitment as Epic PvP gear to obtain. In this scenario, it is worth targeting just two pieces of the [Lieutenant Commander's Refuge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=551/lieutenant-commanders-refuge) / [Champion's Refuge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=539/champions-refuge) PvP sets to take advantage of the strong set bonus, with PvE gear used everywhere else in the gear set.

### Body Armor for Feral Druid DPS

#### Head for Feral Druid DPS

[![Wolfshead Helm](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_04.gif) Wolfshead Helm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8345/wolfshead-helm) is the only viable helm option for cats, both in vanilla and throughout the majority of TBC. Powershifting is such a massive DPS increase from a conventional energy-limited rotation that no DPS stats come remotely close to matching the benefit of this helm. Specifically, compared to just the baseline Furor talent, the 20 extra energy from Wolfshead results in 80 energy per powershift after the next energy tick, which is enough to enable two specials in a four second DPS cycle.  
  
**Recommended BiS Helm Enchant**: [![Lesser Arcanum of Voracity](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gem_03.gif) Lesser Arcanum of Voracity](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11647/lesser-arcanum-of-voracity)

#### Wrist for Feral Druid DPS

Similar to the Rank 13 chest, the PvP bracers from Exalted [Warsong Gulch](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3277/warsong-gulch) reputation are significantly better than all alternative options in Phases 1-4.

#### Hands for Feral Druid DPS

The glove slot is another place where PvP gear reigns supreme, and the Rank 12 gloves will not be replaced until [![Gloves of Enforcement](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_17.gif) Gloves of Enforcement](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=21672/gloves-of-enforcement) in AQ40.

#### Waist for Feral Druid DPS

[![Cloudrunner Girdle](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_10.gif) Cloudrunner Girdle](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13252/cloudrunner-girdle) is individually the highest DPS belt for Ferals in Phase 4. However, [![Molten Belt](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_13.gif) Molten Belt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19163/molten-belt) is *less than 0.5 DPS worse*, making it easily the superior choice given the complete lack of Stamina on [![Cloudrunner Girdle](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_10.gif) Cloudrunner Girdle](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13252/cloudrunner-girdle). Note that if you have obtained Exalted reputation with [Arathi Basin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3358/arathi-basin) and do not yet have [![Boots of the Shadow Flame](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_cloth_05.gif) Boots of the Shadow Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19381/boots-of-the-shadow-flame), then it is worth using [![Highlander's Leather Girdle](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_17.gif) Highlander's Leather Girdle](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20045/highlanders-leather-girdle) / [![Defiler's Leather Girdle](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_17.gif) Defiler's Leather Girdle](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20190/defilers-leather-girdle) over either of these two belts, as the 3-set loses less than 1 DPS compared to off-pieces (except for the [Nefarian](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11583/nefarian) boots) while packing a lot more total Stamina.

#### Legs for Feral Druid DPS

The optimal choice of leg armor depends indirectly on the other itemization in your gear set. If you do not plan on PvPing at all, then you will continue to wear [![Devilsaur Leggings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_wolf.gif) Devilsaur Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=15062/devilsaur-leggings) alongside [![Devilsaur Gauntlets](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_26.gif) Devilsaur Gauntlets](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=15063/devilsaur-gauntlets) throughout Phase 4 for the set bonus, as long as you have sufficient Hit budget available in your gear set to take advantage of the bonus. There are three scenarios in which it is optimal to break the Devilsaur set:  
  
**(1)** If you achieve Rank 12 in PvP, then [![Marshal's Dragonhide Legguards](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_06.gif) Marshal's Dragonhide Legguards](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16450/marshals-dragonhide-legguards) / [![General's Dragonhide Leggings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_06.gif) General's Dragonhide Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16552/generals-dragonhide-leggings) will be your default leg choice for almost the entirety of Classic, replaced only in [Naxxramas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3456/naxxramas) by [![Leggings of Apocalypse](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_leather_09.gif) Leggings of Apocalypse](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23071/leggings-of-apocalypse).  
  
**(2)** If you achieve Rank 8 in PvP, then you will break the Devilsaur set in order to use your Rank 7 gloves in conjunction with the Rank 8 chest piece. In this scenario, either [![Plaguehound Leggings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_12.gif) Plaguehound Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18736/plaguehound-leggings) or [![Abyssal Leather Leggings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_leather_05.gif) Abyssal Leather Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20665/abyssal-leather-leggings) of Striking should be used in the leg slot depending on your available Hit budget, as they are individually the best available leg options for cat DPS in Phase 4 aside from the Rank 12 PvP pants.  
  
**(3)** If you are lucky enough to obtain all three of [![Band of Accuria](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_15.gif) Band of Accuria](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17063/band-of-accuria), [![Boots of the Shadow Flame](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_cloth_05.gif) Boots of the Shadow Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19381/boots-of-the-shadow-flame), and [![Drake Fang Talisman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bone_06.gif) Drake Fang Talisman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19406/drake-fang-talisman), then even non-PvPers should wear [![Plaguehound Leggings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_12.gif) Plaguehound Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18736/plaguehound-leggings) or [![Abyssal Leather Leggings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_leather_05.gif) Abyssal Leather Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20665/abyssal-leather-leggings) of Striking. In this scenario, there is simply not enough Hit budget available in your gear set to accommodate the [Devilsaur Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=143/devilsaur-armor) set bonus.  
  
**Recommended BiS Leg Armor:** [![Lesser Arcanum of Voracity](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gem_03.gif) Lesser Arcanum of Voracity](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11647/lesser-arcanum-of-voracity)

#### Feet for Feral Druid DPS

[![Boots of the Shadow Flame](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_cloth_05.gif) Boots of the Shadow Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19381/boots-of-the-shadow-flame) are the second largest DPS upgrade for Feral Druids in Phase 4 (after [![Drake Fang Talisman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bone_06.gif) Drake Fang Talisman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19406/drake-fang-talisman)), and provide a large enough jump in value from [![Highlander's Leather Boots](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_cloth_05.gif) Highlander's Leather Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20052/highlanders-leather-boots) / [![Defiler's Leather Boots](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_cloth_05.gif) Defiler's Leather Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20186/defilers-leather-boots) to merit breaking the 3-piece [Arathi Basin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3358/arathi-basin) set bonus that was optimal in Phase 1-2.  
  
**Recommended BiS Feet Enchant**: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Enchant Boots - Minor Speed](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=13890/enchant-boots-minor-speed) / [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Enchant Boots - Greater Agility](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20023/enchant-boots-greater-agility)  
Some form of movement speed enhancement is mandatory for competitive raiding, as even a very slight improvement in active uptime on raid bosses or trash mobs vastly outweighs the DPS contribution from a few additional stats. Feral Druids have two competitive options for boosting their movement speed in Phase 4: You can either enchant Minor Speed to a conventional pair of DPS boots, *or* you can leverage the built-in speed boost on the Arathi Basin reputation boots, allowing you to use a DPS enchant on them instead.

### Jewelry for Feral Druid DPS

#### Neck for Feral Druid DPS

In Phase 4, [![Prestor's Talisman of Connivery](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_17.gif) Prestor's Talisman of Connivery](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19377/prestors-talisman-of-connivery) replaces [![Onyxia Tooth Pendant](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_09.gif) Onyxia Tooth Pendant](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18404/onyxia-tooth-pendant) as the best necklace option for cat DPS, and it will remain best in slot for the rest of the game. The arrival of the [Darkmoon Faire](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classic-darkmoon-faire) in Phase 4 also introduces a new intermediate neck option, [![Amulet of the Darkmoon](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_14.gif) Amulet of the Darkmoon](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19491/amulet-of-the-darkmoon), that can serve as a solid introductory piece prior to obtaining the Onyxia or Nefarian necks.

#### Rings for Feral Druid DPS

[![Band of Accuria](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_15.gif) Band of Accuria](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17063/band-of-accuria) significantly outclasses all other Phase 4 rings, and is BiS for Feral DPS for the *entire game*, provided that you have available "Hit budget" in your gear set to utilize its full Hit value. This ring is also insanely valuable for bear tanking, making it the most important raid drop to prioritize in Phase 1 content. BoA will be heavily contested by all physical DPS classes, but Ferals have a strong case for high priority on this item given its longevity and impact. The optimal choice in the second ring slot is the new [Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair) drop [![Circle of Applied Force](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_37.gif) Circle of Applied Force](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19432/circle-of-applied-force), which is an especially nice pickup because it lacks any Hit on it, making it easier to accommodate other high value Hit pieces like [![Drake Fang Talisman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bone_06.gif) Drake Fang Talisman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19406/drake-fang-talisman) and [![Boots of the Shadow Flame](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_cloth_05.gif) Boots of the Shadow Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19381/boots-of-the-shadow-flame).

#### Trinkets for Feral Druid DPS

The highly coveted [![Drake Fang Talisman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bone_06.gif) Drake Fang Talisman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19406/drake-fang-talisman) trinket (DFT) is the most impactful upgrade for cat DPS Druids in Phase 4 by a landslide, providing a cat with 120 AP equivalent worth of DPS in a single item slot. One downside of this trinket, however, is that the majority of its DPS contribution comes from Hit, which means that gear sets utilizing DFT are often forced to give up other high value Hit items (such as the [Devilsaur Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=143/devilsaur-armor) set) in order to not exceed the 9% Hit cap.  
  
After [![Drake Fang Talisman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bone_06.gif) Drake Fang Talisman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19406/drake-fang-talisman), [![Blackhand's Breadth](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_armorkit_09.gif) Blackhand's Breadth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13965/blackhands-breadth) is the next best DPS trinket in Phase 4, and will not be replaced until Phase 5 at the *earliest* after acquiring both DFT *and* [![Jom Gabbar](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_enggizmos_19.gif) Jom Gabbar](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23570/jom-gabbar). Note that since Feral Druids are a hybrid spec that will both tank and DPS in raids, you will have to choose between taking [![Blackhand's Breadth](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_armorkit_09.gif) Blackhand's Breadth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13965/blackhands-breadth) for DPS/TPS or taking [![Mark of Tyranny](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_09.gif) Mark of Tyranny](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13966/mark-of-tyranny) for mitigation, as they are both rewards from the same pre-raid quest. Both of these trinkets provide very high value for their respective roles, so there is no wrong choice here - either option can be correct depending on your raid environment and tanking role.  
  
If you are missing DFT or [![Blackhand's Breadth](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_armorkit_09.gif) Blackhand's Breadth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13965/blackhands-breadth), then either [![Hand of Justice](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_01.gif) Hand of Justice](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11815/hand-of-justice) or [![Rune of the Guard Captain](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_rune_07.gif) Rune of the Guard Captain](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19120/rune-of-the-guard-captain) can be used in the second trinket slot since they sim at identical DPS, but the latter is restricted to only Horde players. However, on fights with Fear mechanics, such as the [Onyxia](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=10184/onyxia) and [Magmadar](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11982/magmadar) encounters, the Blacksmithing and PvP trinkets can provide more DPS value in practice by increasing your active uptime on the boss.

### Weapons and Idols for Feral Druid DPS

#### Weapons for Feral Druid DPS

[![Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_14.gif) Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler) is the most important consumable for Feral Druids by a landslide, so expect to farm a ton of these over the course of Classic if you intend to raid competitively as a Feral. No other weapon comes remotely close in value, as MCP alone contributes *10%* of your total DPS. **MCPs are so efficient in terms of DPS added per time spent farming that it is preferable to use literally no other consumables but come to raid with a full set of Pummelers, rather than stacking every other DPS consumable with a conventional weapon.**  
  
For most players, MCPs will be used exclusively for boss fights, as it can be impractical to farm and carry sufficient quantities for trash usage as well. As a result, [![Draconic Maul](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_05.gif) Draconic Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19358/draconic-maul) should be used as the best alternative weapon choice for trash fights or 5-man dungeons.  
  
**Recommended BiS Weapon Enchant**: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Enchant 2H Weapon - Agility](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=27837/enchant-2h-weapon-agility)  
While the 25 Agility weapon enchant is best in slot for DPS, a more practical budget choice for your Pummelers is [![Iron Counterweight](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_orb_01.gif) Iron Counterweight](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6043/iron-counterweight), as it is substantially cheaper when enchanting a bag full of MCPs every raid.

#### Idols for Feral Druid DPS

There are unfortunately no Idol options in WoW Classic that benefit Feral DPS. The only "cat Idol" in Classic is [![Idol of Ferocity](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_relics_idolofferocity.gif) Idol of Ferocity](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22397/idol-of-ferocity), which is useless in a PvE setting since neither [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_rake.gif) Claw](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9850/claw) nor [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_disembowel.gif) Rake](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9904/rake) are used in the Feral DPS rotation. In contrast, [![Idol of Brutality](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_relics_idolofferocity.gif) Idol of Brutality](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23198/idol-of-brutality) for bears is a phenomenal tanking Idol, so it is recommended to keep it permanently equipped when playing a hybrid DPS + tanking role in raids.
