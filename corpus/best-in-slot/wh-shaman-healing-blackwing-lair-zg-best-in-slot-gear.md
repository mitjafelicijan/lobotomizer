# Restoration Shaman Healer Best in Slot Gear Blackwing Lair & Zul'Gurub - WoW Classic Phase 4

Welcome to Wowhead's Phase 4 Best in Slot Gear list for Restoration Shaman Healing in WoW Classic. This guide will list the recommended gear for Restoration Shaman Healing from raids, dungeons, PvP, professions, world drops, reputations, and instances.

Best In Slot Gear for Restoration Shaman Healer
-----------------------------------------------

In Phase 4, you will have access to [Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair) epic raid gear, including [The Ten Storms](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=216/the-ten-storms) set, which has powerful bonuses for Restoration [![Shaman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_shaman.gif) Shaman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=7/shaman)s. The three-piece bonus, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Improved Chain Heal](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=21899/improved-chain-heal), is particularly important to obtain quickly, as it provides a very large healing increase!  
  
Alternatively, having full Tier 1 is still great for [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_healingwavegreater.gif) Chain Healing Wave](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=23573/chain-healing-wave), but it is usually more beneficial to combine some Tier 2 and the best off-tier healing pieces from [Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair).  
  
By going into the **gear planner links** below, you can edit in your own gear and simulate the effect of adding other pieces of gear, which can be useful when adapting the best in slot to your particular items and needs.

### Body Armor for Restoration Shaman Healer

The listed gear is mostly weighted on +Healing, Mp5 and Intellect, as well as relevant tier set bonuses, which can be very powerful, but often require using sub-optimal pieces, stats-wise. **Also, while there are a lot of options for each slot, we will refrain from creating huge lists in order to avoid clutter.** You can find other alternatives in the pre-raid section of the guide, or with the gear planner.

#### Head for Restoration Shaman Healer

[![Crystal Adorned Crown](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_crown_01.gif) Crystal Adorned Crown](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19132/crystal-adorned-crown) is the BiS Head however, it is a very competitive option and difficult to obtain due to it dropping from a World boss. [![Helmet of Ten Storms](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_69.gif) Helmet of Ten Storms](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16947/helmet-of-ten-storms) is relatively easy to obtain and therefore serves as a more realistic option.  
  
[![Earthfury Helmet](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_09.gif) Earthfury Helmet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16842/earthfury-helmet) is the best Tier 1 piece and can be used on its own, although you would ideally use it alongside the rest of the Tier 1 gear for the powerful set bonuses, if so inclined.  
  
**Recommended BiS Helm Enchant**: [![Vodouisant's Vigilant Embrace](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_purge.gif) Vodouisant's Vigilant Embrace](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19786/vodouisants-vigilant-embrace)

#### Shoulders for Restoration Shaman Healer

[![Wild Growth Spaulders](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_18.gif) Wild Growth Spaulders](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18810/wild-growth-spaulders) are by far the strongest shoulders available, and will hold their value throughout the rest of Classic. [![Earthfury Epaulets](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_29.gif) Earthfury Epaulets](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16844/earthfury-epaulets) is a decent tier piece, which can be used to hit the 8-set bonus.  
  
Finally [![Royal Cap Spaulders](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_11.gif) Royal Cap Spaulders](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14548/royal-cap-spaulders) is a great blue piece you can easily get while leveling and which still hold value at Level 60. The Tier 2 shoulder piece is very weak and should be avoided.  
  
**Recommended BiS Shoulder Enchant**: [![Zandalar Signet of Serenity](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_powerwordshield.gif) Zandalar Signet of Serenity](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20078/zandalar-signet-of-serenity)

[![Shroud of Pure Thought](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_16.gif) Shroud of Pure Thought](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19430/shroud-of-pure-thought) and [![Hide of the Wild](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_01.gif) Hide of the Wild](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18510/hide-of-the-wild) are the best cloaks available by a large margin, but if you are on a budget, [![Cloak of the Cosmos](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_01.gif) Cloak of the Cosmos](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18389/cloak-of-the-cosmos) or even the easily accessible [![Deep Woodlands Cloak](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_17.gif) Deep Woodlands Cloak](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19121/deep-woodlands-cloak) will do as well.  
  
**Recommended BiS Cloak Enchant**: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Enchant Cloak - Greater Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20014/enchant-cloak-greater-resistance)

[![Earthfury Vestments](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_chain_11.gif) Earthfury Vestments](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16841/earthfury-vestments) is not an amazing item by itself, but is a Tier 1 piece which you must obtain if you intend on using the full set. The Tier 2 chest is relatively weak, and should only be used for obtaining the 3 or 5-piece tier bonuses, if you lack alternative pieces.  
  
**Recommended BiS Chest Enchant**: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Enchant Chest - Greater Stats](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20025/enchant-chest-greater-stats)

#### Trinkets for Restoration Shaman Healer

[![Rejuvenating Gem](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gem_topaz_02.gif) Rejuvenating Gem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19395/rejuvenating-gem) has both high healing and Mp5, making it the best and most consistent trinket. [![Briarwood Reed](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_root_02.gif) Briarwood Reed](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12930/briarwood-reed) is hard to get but sports a very high amount of +Healing, as do the more easily obtainable [![Second Wind](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_06.gif) Second Wind](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11819/second-wind) and [![Royal Seal of Eldre'Thalas](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_10.gif) Royal Seal of Eldre'Thalas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18471/royal-seal-of-eldrethalas).  
  
[![Mindtap Talisman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_battery_02.gif) Mindtap Talisman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18371/mindtap-talisman) is also great, but for Mp5 purposes, as is [![Shard of the Scale](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_monsterscales_15.gif) Shard of the Scale](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17064/shard-of-the-scale) which is stronger, but also much harder to get. [![Draconic Infused Emblem](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_09.gif) Draconic Infused Emblem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22268/draconic-infused-emblem) should be used when it is off-cooldown, and swapped out while it is on cooldown.  
  
Finally, [![Enamored Water Spirit](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_wand_01.gif) Enamored Water Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20503/enamored-water-spirit) is a special item which is obtained from a high level class trainer questline. As long as you remember to swap to it when it is off-cooldown, it is a great Mana trinket, especially for a caster group! [![Natural Alignment Crystal](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gem_03.gif) Natural Alignment Crystal](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19344/natural-alignment-crystal) and [![Draconic Infused Emblem](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_09.gif) Draconic Infused Emblem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22268/draconic-infused-emblem) serve similar purposes as cooldown trinkets.

### Weapons and Offhands for Restoration Shaman Healer

#### Main Hand Weapons for Restoration Shaman Healer

Due to their inclusion in Phase 3, PvP weapons such as [![Grand Marshal's Warhammer](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_02.gif) Grand Marshal's Warhammer](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23454/grand-marshals-warhammer) are the obvious best options and will have no equal until [Ahn'Qiraj](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3428/ahnqiraj) comes out. [![Mindfang](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_sword_13.gif) Mindfang](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20214/mindfang) will also be available right away, and is much easier to obtain, although it still requires a lengthy grind.  
  
In [Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair), you can get two good weapons, [![Lok'amir il Romathis](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_06.gif) Lok'amir il Romathis](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19360/lokamir-il-romathis) and [![Claw of Chromaggus](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_shortblade_28.gif) Claw of Chromaggus](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19347/claw-of-chromaggus), and Lok'amir has limited competition, as most casters cannot use mace weapons.  
  
[![Fang of the Mystics](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_shortblade_06.gif) Fang of the Mystics](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17070/fang-of-the-mystics) is also great, but hard to get due to coming from a world boss. Thus, [![Aurastone Hammer](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_05.gif) Aurastone Hammer](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17105/aurastone-hammer), [![The Hammer of Grace](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_07.gif) The Hammer of Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11923/the-hammer-of-grace) and the easily obtainable [![Lorespinner](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_shortblade_21.gif) Lorespinner](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18491/lorespinner) are the most realistic options for Phase 4 weapons. [![Redemption](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_staff_23.gif) Redemption](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22406/redemption) is a viable alternative weapon, especially for +Healing focused builds.
