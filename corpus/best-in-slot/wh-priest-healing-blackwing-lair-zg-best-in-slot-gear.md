# Priest Healer Best in Slot Gear Blackwing Lair & Zul'Gurub - WoW Classic Phase 4

Welcome to Wowhead's Phase 4 Best in Slot Gear list for Priest Healing in WoW Classic. This guide will list the recommended gear for Priest Healing from raids, dungeons, PvP, professions, world drops, reputations, and instances.

Best In Slot Gear for Priest Healer
-----------------------------------

From Phase 4 onwards Priest BiS consists of two different sets. Eventually, you'll want to have both of them, but it's useful to choose one to go for initially for easier loot distribution.  
  
The **8/8 T2** build has potential use cases in [Ahn'Qiraj](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3428/ahnqiraj) and [Naxxramas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3456/naxxramas), especially on the [Sapphiron](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15989/sapphiron) encounter, and is stronger in Anniversary Classic due to the removal of the buff cap. The main benefit of this set is simply that the efficiency and throughput of Rank 1 [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Greater Heal](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2060/greater-heal) with the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Greater Heal Renew](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22010/greater-heal-renew) set bonus becomes unmatched whenever the situation allows you to make use of the HoT effect. Although it was primarily used for raid healing, with HoTs no longer putting your tank at risk of losing world buffs, there's not much preventing you from using it for tank healing as well. It's also worth mentioning that this build synergizes incredibly well with the [![Hazza'rah's Charm of Healing](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_19.gif) Hazza'rah's Charm of Healing](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19958/hazzarahs-charm-of-healing) trinket.  
  
The **+Healing** build forgoes the 8/8 set bonus to instead use offset items that are individually stronger than their Tier 2 counterparts, while still using three pieces for the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Meditation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=21894/meditation) bonus. This set is the better option when you can't get much value out of the T2 HoT on a certain encounter or when you've already got enough priests running the other build. The main drawback here is that a decent amount of the offset items that are already available in Phase 4 tend to be heavily sought after by other healer classes as well, which makes it tricky to collect enough pieces to warrant using it over full tier.

### Set Bonuses

There are four set bonuses you should be aware of during Phase 4.  
  
The 3 set [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_sleep.gif) Meditation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=21894/meditation) bonus of the [Vestments of Transcendence](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=211/vestments-of-transcendence) set is worth around 40 to 45 mp5 in Phase 4 BiS, which is a fairly significant amount when considering how good the tier pieces are by themselves. You practically never want to drop this bonus once you get access to it, since it's generally not a worthwhile trade-off. In future phases, you'll ideally want to use any combination of Chestplate, Bracers, Gloves and Legs to keep the 3p bonus, since those items are closest to the BiS offpieces in terms of value.  
  
The 5 set [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_magic_lesserinvisibilty.gif) Reactive Fade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=21853/reactive-fade) bonus of the [Vestments of Transcendence](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=211/vestments-of-transcendence) set is handy for dungeons but fairly unimportant in actual raids, as it does not stack with your regular fade and you should rarely have threat on any mobs outside of small add spawns.   
  
The 8 set [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Greater Heal Renew](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22010/greater-heal-renew) bonus of the [Vestments of Transcendence](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=211/vestments-of-transcendence) set is incredibly powerful whenever there's enough outgoing raid damage for the HoT to not just get sniped by other healers. With the 8/8 T2 BIS set, GH1 does 686 healing per second on the initial hit, and another 780 from the HoT component, which adds up to 1466 combined HPS. That's almost 75% higher healing per second than Rank 7 Flash Heal while also being two and a half times as efficient. One thing worth mentioning is that you'll have to weave in other spells if you are tank healing with this set bonus, as chain-casting Greater Heal on the same target results in the HoT getting refreshed before it gets to tick.  
  
The 2 set [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Increase Healing 22](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9408/increase-healing-22) bonus of the [Confessor's Raiment](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=480/confessors-raiment) set is very straightforward, as you simply gain 22 additional healing power. However, this bonus makes two pieces of the set a worthwhile addition to your +Healing set in Phase 4.   
  
As the 3p T2 bonus is quite impactful, it makes sense to round robin the initial tier drops until everyone has it, before then funneling the extra drops to designated 8/8 Priests.

### Body Armor for Priest Healer

#### Head for Priest Healer

[![Halo of Transcendence](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_24.gif) Halo of Transcendence](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16921/halo-of-transcendence) is still the go-to for most priests in Phase 4, especially if you are going for the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Greater Heal Renew](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22010/greater-heal-renew) set bonus.   
  
[![Crystal Adorned Crown](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_crown_01.gif) Crystal Adorned Crown](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19132/crystal-adorned-crown), which drops off [Azuregos](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=6109/azuregos) from Phase 2 onwards, is incredibly powerful with nearly twice as much healing power as the next best option as well as decent sustain stats. Though other head options later in the game generally provide more mana regeneration, there's no helmet with more healing power than this one, which is why it's a great item for any offpiece gear set.

#### Shoulders for Priest Healer

Although it's not a massive upgrade over the P1 options, [![Pauldrons of Transcendence](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_02.gif) Pauldrons of Transcendence](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16924/pauldrons-of-transcendence) are definitely what you want to be using for your shoulders in the 8/8 build.  
  
In combination with another piece of the set, [![Zandalar Confessor's Mantle](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_01.gif) Zandalar Confessor's Mantle](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19841/zandalar-confessors-mantle) becomes your best option for the +healing build, and is also the next best item of the set if you do not run the Trinket to maintain the 2-set.  
  
**Recommended BiS Shoulder Enchant**: [![Zandalar Signet of Serenity](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_powerwordshield.gif) Zandalar Signet of Serenity](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20078/zandalar-signet-of-serenity)

#### Back for Priest Healer

Swapping to [![Shroud of Pure Thought](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_16.gif) Shroud of Pure Thought](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19430/shroud-of-pure-thought) is a fairly good trade-off for additional sustain, so if you are speedrunning or could simply make use of the additional mana, it's certainly worth picking up.  
  
[![Hide of the Wild](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_01.gif) Hide of the Wild](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18510/hide-of-the-wild) is still a perfectly fine cloak and can be worn until Phase 6 without missing out on anything major.

#### Chest for Priest Healer

[![Robes of Transcendence](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_cloth_03.gif) Robes of Transcendence](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16923/robes-of-transcendence) are one of the strongest T2 pieces, so they're worth wearing in both offset and 8p sets, as you gain a decent amount of stats and sustain over [![Truefaith Vestments](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_cloth_31.gif) Truefaith Vestments](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14154/truefaith-vestments).

#### Wrist for Priest Healer

[![Bindings of Transcendence](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_bracer_09.gif) Bindings of Transcendence](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16926/bindings-of-transcendence) are an easy choice here as they are individually the strongest item and help you access the incredible three piece and eight piece bonuses of the [Vestments of Transcendence](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=211/vestments-of-transcendence) set.

#### Feet for Priest Healer

[![Boots of Transcendence](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_07.gif) Boots of Transcendence](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16919/boots-of-transcendence) are an upgrade over every Phase 2 alternative and are obviously a must-have for the 8/8 Tier 2 build.   
  
[![Boots of Pure Thought](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_cloth_03.gif) Boots of Pure Thought](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19437/boots-of-pure-thought) are the boots with the highest healing power in the entire expansion, which makes them a great pick if you opt for the offset build. However, as they only drop off two mob packs in [Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair), they tend to be incredibly rare.

### Jewelry for Priest Healer

#### Neck for Priest Healer

[![Animated Chain Necklace](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_01.gif) Animated Chain Necklace](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18723/animated-chain-necklace) is finally replaced by [![Jin'do's Evil Eye](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_45.gif) Jin'do's Evil Eye](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19885/jindos-evil-eye), though it tends to be a fairly rare item. However, if you do get unlucky, you'll still be able to obtain [![Head of Ossirian the Unscarred](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_hunter_pet_owl.gif) Head of Ossirian the Unscarred](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=21220/head-of-ossirian-the-unscarred) fairly easily in Phase 4, which provides a necklace that is just as strong.

While [![Cauterizing Band](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_39.gif) Cauterizing Band](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19140/cauterizing-band) is not quite as good as the [![Pure Elementium Band](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_42.gif) Pure Elementium Band](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19382/pure-elementium-band), it's still the best option for your second ring slot up until Phase 4.

#### Trinkets for Priest Healer

Nearly every WoW Classic [![Priest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_priest.gif) Priest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=5/priest) regards [![Hazza'rah's Charm of Healing](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_19.gif) Hazza'rah's Charm of Healing](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19958/hazzarahs-charm-of-healing) as the most impactful healing item in the entire expansion and more or less kept it equipped permanently, so you should make sure to get it as soon as possible. It brings your [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Greater Heal](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=2060/greater-heal) cast time down to 1.5s and also reduces its mana cost by 5% for 15s, which is just as powerful as it sounds. There's two ways to utilize it, which are either activating it when a lot of raidhealing is needed and using GH5 to deliver more healing per second than any other ability in Classic, or alternatively using it to conserve mana by simply chain-casting a low rank like GH1.  
  
While it's not quite as impactful as HCH, [![Hibernation Crystal](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gem_stone_01.gif) Hibernation Crystal](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20636/hibernation-crystal) is another fairly huge throughput trinket with a very short cooldown, which makes it incredible for trinketswapping on trash pulls.  
  
[![Rejuvenating Gem](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gem_topaz_02.gif) Rejuvenating Gem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19395/rejuvenating-gem) and [![Royal Seal of Eldre'Thalas](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_10.gif) Royal Seal of Eldre'Thalas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18469/royal-seal-of-eldrethalas) both provide a large amount of static +healing and mp5, which makes them your best passive trinkets in Phase 4. [![Rejuvenating Gem](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gem_topaz_02.gif) Rejuvenating Gem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19395/rejuvenating-gem) in particular remains a great trinket option for the entirety of Classic, so it's one of the most sought after healer drops in [Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair).  
  
If you want to optimize further than that, you can trinket swap between [![Blessed Prayer Beads](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_11.gif) Blessed Prayer Beads](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19990/blessed-prayer-beads), [![Draconic Infused Emblem](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_09.gif) Draconic Infused Emblem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22268/draconic-infused-emblem) and [![Royal Seal of Eldre'Thalas](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_10.gif) Royal Seal of Eldre'Thalas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18469/royal-seal-of-eldrethalas) between trash pulls, ideally through an itemrack queue, while keeping [![Rejuvenating Gem](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gem_topaz_02.gif) Rejuvenating Gem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19395/rejuvenating-gem) permanently equipped in the other slot. This allows you to make use of the large healing power on-use effects while not having to wait through the entire cooldown and will provide more value than sticking to just one trinket if executed well.  
  
Alternatively, [![Darkmoon Card: Blue Dragon](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_ticket_tarot_bluedragon_01.gif) Darkmoon Card: Blue Dragon](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19288/darkmoon-card-blue-dragon) and [![Shard of the Scale](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_monsterscales_15.gif) Shard of the Scale](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17064/shard-of-the-scale) are solid trinkets for mana regeneration, though simply downranking and using more mana consumes more is generally a better way to manage your mana. Although [![Darkmoon Card: Blue Dragon](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_ticket_tarot_bluedragon_01.gif) Darkmoon Card: Blue Dragon](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19288/darkmoon-card-blue-dragon) provides more value with 38.4/29.5/24 mp5 at 40/30/24 casts per minute respectively (assuming 8/8 T2 BiS), it's more rng-heavy than the other trinket due to the low proc chance, so some might still prefer [![Shard of the Scale](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_monsterscales_15.gif) Shard of the Scale](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17064/shard-of-the-scale).

### Weapons and Offhands for Priest Healer

#### Main Hand Weapons for Priest Healer

If you've managed to reach Rank 14, [![High Warlord's Battle Mace](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_02.gif) High Warlord's Battle Mace](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23464/high-warlords-battle-mace)/[![Grand Marshal's Warhammer](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_02.gif) Grand Marshal's Warhammer](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23454/grand-marshals-warhammer) is by far the best Phase 4 option and will remain your BiS up until Phase 4.  
  
While [![Lok'amir il Romathis](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_06.gif) Lok'amir il Romathis](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19360/lokamir-il-romathis) is technically an upgrade over [![Benediction](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_staff_30.gif) Benediction](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18608/benediction) when combined with [![Lei of the Lifegiver](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_flower_04.gif) Lei of the Lifegiver](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19312/lei-of-the-lifegiver), it's fairly rare and should always go to the other healer classes first, so it's left out of the sets at the top of the guide.  
  
**Recommended BiS Weapon Enchants**: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Enchant Weapon - Healing Power](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22750/enchant-weapon-healing-power)

#### Off-Hand Weapons for Priest Healer

[![Lei of the Lifegiver](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_flower_04.gif) Lei of the Lifegiver](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19312/lei-of-the-lifegiver) is the best option in this slot and also fairly easy to acquire, even if you are not really a fan of battlegrounds. If you absolutely don't want to do any PvP, [![Tome of Divine Right](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_book_07.gif) Tome of Divine Right](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22319/tome-of-divine-right) is an excellent alternative off-hand with good balance of healing power and mana regeneration. Luckily, as soon as you obtain your [![Benediction](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_staff_30.gif) Benediction](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18608/benediction), you likely won't have to worry about off-hands until Phase 4 at least.

It's also one of the most iconic priest weapons and requires you to complete an unique quest chain which will test your skills as a healer. It's worth mentioning that the enchant on the weapon is shared between both versions, so if you spend a lot of time PvPing or grinding, you might want to opt for [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Enchant Weapon - Spell Power](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22749/enchant-weapon-spell-power) instead, as long as your guild doesn't mind it.

#### Wands for Priest Healer

Which one of the three wands you'll want to use is mostly up to preference, but [Lunar Wand of Healing](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=15283&&rand=-26) is generally a safe choice due to it increasing both your throughput and allowing you to downrank more efficiently.
