# Warlock DPS Best in Slot Gear Blackwing Lair & Zul'Gurub - WoW Classic Phase 4

Welcome to Wowhead's Phase 4 Blackwing Lair Best in Slot Gear list for Warlock DPS in WoW Classic. This guide will list the recommended gear for Warlock DPS from raids, dungeons, PvP, professions, world drops, reputations, and instances.

Best In Slot Gear for Warlock DPS
---------------------------------

The recommendations listed below for each gear slot are simply that - recommendations. They have been chosen based on a combination of Spell Power / Crit / Hit / Intellect, and we have taken care to provide a range of alternatives. For more specific situations, the [Classic Warlock Discord](https://discord.gg/8mrt6DE) maintains a [gear simulation spreadsheet](https://discord.gg/8mrt6DE) which will help you evaluate the best combination of gear available to you.  
  
All items are listed in order of pure DPS value, ignoring guild loot priority or set bonuses. If exceptions apply, they will be listed in the descriptions.  
  

[Warlock Discord & Gear Sim Spreadsheet](https://discord.gg/8mrt6DE)

  
  
The most important gearing consideration in Phase 5 for warlocks is what items you swap out in order to gain beneficial set bonuses. This is going to be highly dependent on the available loot you have, such as world boss loot, the rare PvP set, etc. This also means you might be sitting on a couple of items before you have enough of them to activate your bonus. To determine this your best option is to load up your gear in one of the tools mentioned before.  
  
**Bloodvine [Bloodvine Garb](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=421/bloodvine-garb)**

* 3 pieces [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Increased Critical Spell](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=18382/increased-critical-spell)

[Bloodvine Garb](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=421/bloodvine-garb) holds a unique place in a warlocks heart. The individual pieces of the set are on par with world boss equivalent loot. However, it can easily be obtained by crafting or by defeating the Auction House boss. You do need tailoring to enjoy the set-piece bonus. This set will be worn well into the last phase when you finally replace it with tier 3.  
  
**Warlock Tier 2 [Nemesis Raiment](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=212/nemesis-raiment)**

* 3 pieces [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Increase Spell Dam 23](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=14047/increase-spell-dam-23)

The three-piece bonus is the only one we care for in order to maximize our DPS. In order to get to our three-piece bonus, we will need to give up slightly stronger items, but the set bonus makes more than up for this. Chest and Belt are the two slots that are always going to be the best trade-off. The third one is going to be dependent on whether you have [![Fel Infused Leggings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_06.gif) Fel Infused Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19133/fel-infused-leggings) and whether you have rank 10 in PvP.  
  
**Warlock Rare PvP Set ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/icons/alliance.png) [Lieutenant Commander's Dreadgear](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=547/lieutenant-commanders-dreadgear) / ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/icons/horde.png) [Champion's Dreadgear](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=541/champions-dreadgear)**

* 2 pieces [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/classic_temp.gif) Increase Spell Dam 23](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=14047/increase-spell-dam-23)

Here we are after the same spell power bonus albeit we only need two pieces in order to get it. This combination is most often achieved by using the shoulder slot with either boots or gloves. Which way you go is going to depend on your raid loot and gear.

What technically is the best is not the most probable you will be running by the end of this phase. It is important to not blindly stare at this gear embed, but rather proactively learn how to use a [gear simulation spreadsheet](https://discord.gg/8mrt6DE) to determine what are logical upgrades. The whole "*Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime*" saying holds very much true for gearing choices and simming.

### Body Armor for Warlock DPS in Season of Mastery Phase 5

#### Head

[![Mish'undare, Circlet of the Mind Flayer](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_52.gif) Mish'undare, Circlet of the Mind Flayer](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19375/mishundare-circlet-of-the-mind-flayer) is still our best headpiece, and will stay that way until at least the beginning of Phase 5 with the release of [Ahn'Qiraj](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3428/ahnqiraj).   
  
[![Spellweaver's Turban](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_62.gif) Spellweaver's Turban](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22267/spellweavers-turban) was in Classic only available at Phase 5 with the Loot Revamp. It is one of the select few pieces of this phase that has actual Hit on it. Not only that, but it is also significantly stronger than the other options in this phase (aside from [![Mish'undare, Circlet of the Mind Flayer](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_52.gif) Mish'undare, Circlet of the Mind Flayer](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19375/mishundare-circlet-of-the-mind-flayer)) and can be gotten outside of raids. Which is a plus with the loot scarcity from raids.  
  
[![The Hexxer's Cover](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mask_02.gif) The Hexxer's Cover](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19886/the-hexxers-cover) and [![Bloodvine Goggles](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_47.gif) Bloodvine Goggles](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19999/bloodvine-goggles) are the two new helms that become available in this phase, sadly they are not any better than the aforementioned ones.

#### Shoulders

[![Mantle of the Blackwing Cabal](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_25.gif) Mantle of the Blackwing Cabal](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19370/mantle-of-the-blackwing-cabal) is technically the best shoulder item if we ignore set bonuses. With Bloodvine odds are that you can forgo using Tier 2 or your rare pvp set, making this a tempting option.  
  
The [![Lieutenant Commander's Dreadweave Spaulders](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_01.gif) Lieutenant Commander's Dreadweave Spaulders](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23311/lieutenant-commanders-dreadweave-spaulders) or horde counterpart is slightly worse than [![Field Marshal's Dreadweave Shoulders](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_02.gif) Field Marshal's Dreadweave Shoulders](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17580/field-marshals-dreadweave-shoulders) but has the added benefit of having an easy-to-reach two-set bonus of +23 SP. As such it is recommended to get at least up to rank 10 in PVP for the Rare Set. This set bonus is best reached through the Shoulder and Boots or Glove slot. This will likely be your go-to until you have the above combination.  
  
[![Nemesis Spaulders](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_19.gif) Nemesis Spaulders](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16932/nemesis-spaulders) can be used as a last resort to get your [Nemesis Raiment](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=212/nemesis-raiment) bonus. However, if you do have rank 10 in PvP, this most likely is not the optimal route.

However, there aren't any real alternatives that are equally strong for all casters. So it might take you a while to get. All other cloaks listed below as "good" are roughly equal in value.

#### Chest

[![Bloodvine Vest](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_cloth_07.gif) Bloodvine Vest](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19682/bloodvine-vest) is a core part of the upgrades in this phase. Easy to get thanks to being a crafted BoE piece, beats out the previous best chest stat to stat, and is part of a great set.  
  
[![Robe of Volatile Power](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_cloth_18.gif) Robe of Volatile Power](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19145/robe-of-volatile-power) is no longer the strongest chest, when you only look at the stats. Whilst transitioning to Bloodvine we can still make use of our [Nemesis Raiment](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=212/nemesis-raiment) 3 pieces bonus, which for [![Nemesis Robes](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_leather_01.gif) Nemesis Robes](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16931/nemesis-robes) is a solid way to do so.

[![Ebony Flame Gloves](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_27.gif) Ebony Flame Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19407/ebony-flame-gloves) is the strongest single piece. If you can get your *hands* on this, you will want to use other item slots to get access to your tier 2 / PVP rare set bonus. Until then gloves can serve to make use of either [![Nemesis Gloves](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_19.gif) Nemesis Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16928/nemesis-gloves) or [![Knight-Lieutenant's Dreadweave Handwraps](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_19.gif) Knight-Lieutenant's Dreadweave Handwraps](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23282/knight-lieutenants-dreadweave-handwraps) (or Horde counterpart) depending on your set bonus needs.

The reason is that with [Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair) out, we get access to [![Nemesis Belt](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_13.gif) Nemesis Belt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16933/nemesis-belt). This belt is near identical and unique to us, and one of the go-to pieces to make use of our three-piece [Nemesis Raiment](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=212/nemesis-raiment) bonus.

[![Fel Infused Leggings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_06.gif) Fel Infused Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19133/fel-infused-leggings) drops from [Lord Kazzak](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12397/lord-kazzak) in Phase 2 and is a significant upgrade over what is available otherwise. This pair of paints will last you a long time. [![Bloodvine Leggings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_cloth_14.gif) Bloodvine Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19683/bloodvine-leggings) on paper is slightly behind, however when combined with the set bonus, it is ahead. Plus a lot easier to get.  
  
However, for a lot of us that don't have access to those pants, [![Nemesis Leggings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_07.gif) Nemesis Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16930/nemesis-leggings) will be the logical next choice.

[![Snowblind Shoes](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_cloth_14.gif) Snowblind Shoes](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19131/snowblind-shoes) is the strongest item on paper. However, it is a World Boss drop and as such will be hard to get your hands on. Plus it means you would miss out on the Bloodvine set bonus.  
  
Previously you would make use of [![Knight-Lieutenant's Dreadweave Walkers](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_05.gif) Knight-Lieutenant's Dreadweave Walkers](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23283/knight-lieutenants-dreadweave-walkers) (or Horde counterpart) along with the shoulders/gloves for the two-piece bonus of 23 spell power. However, currently, you will want to use other items/slots to make this come true due to [![Bloodvine Boots](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_cloth_02.gif) Bloodvine Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19684/bloodvine-boots).

### Jewelry for Warlock DPS in Season of Mastery Phase 5

#### Neck

Not a lot changes in the necklace space of gearing.   
  
[![Choker of the Fire Lord](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_amulet_05.gif) Choker of the Fire Lord](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18814/choker-of-the-fire-lord) is bar none the best neck in the game for a long time. Only getting replaced in Phase 5 the soonest by [![Amulet of Vek'nilash](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_ahnqiraj_01.gif) Amulet of Vek'nilash](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=21608/amulet-of-veknilash). But it is not only this good for us warlocks. All fellow casters will be after this item as well. Instead, you will most likely be working with [![Nacreous Shell Necklace](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_10.gif) Nacreous Shell Necklace](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22403/nacreous-shell-necklace) or [![Dark Advisor's Pendant](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_06.gif) Dark Advisor's Pendant](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18691/dark-advisors-pendant).

#### Rings

We do get a new technical best-in slot ring this phase. [![Band of Forced Concentration](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_34.gif) Band of Forced Concentration](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19403/band-of-forced-concentration) combined with [![Mindtear Band](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_04.gif) Mindtear Band](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20632/mindtear-band) is our new best ring combination. [![Mindtear Band](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_04.gif) Mindtear Band](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20632/mindtear-band) drops from [Taerar](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=14890/taerar), which is one of the four Dragons of Nightmare.  
  
[![Don Rodrigo's Band](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_34.gif) Don Rodrigo's Band](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=21563/don-rodrigos-band) isn't all that good for normal fights. It does have a unique application, it is the only ring with Spell Penetration available. There are two bosses in this phase where this has use; Lucifron with 186 and Gehennas with 93 Shadow Resistance. For these bosses [![Don Rodrigo's Band](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_34.gif) Don Rodrigo's Band](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=21563/don-rodrigos-band) is Best in Slot.

#### Trinkets

[![Neltharion's Tear](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_stone_15.gif) Neltharion's Tear](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19379/neltharions-tear) not only causes Nelth to cry but also us when we either get the item from joy or when we lose the roll to a mage. It is the strongest option for an incredibly long time, even getting used still in early TBC. This combined with [![Talisman of Ephemeral Power](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_stonetablet_11.gif) Talisman of Ephemeral Power](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18820/talisman-of-ephemeral-power) has us set for a long time.  
  
[![Talisman of Ephemeral Power](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_stonetablet_11.gif) Talisman of Ephemeral Power](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18820/talisman-of-ephemeral-power) is an exceptional trinket for Warlocks, the massive spell damage bonus synergizes extremely well with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_shadowbolt.gif) Shadow Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=11661/shadow-bolt) and our DoTs. This is one of the best trinkets in the entire expansion for Warlocks. Warlocks aren't the only ones that will be clamoring for this trinket though, so you may have to pick from the alternatives listed below.  
  
[![Zandalarian Hero Charm](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_13.gif) Zandalarian Hero Charm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19950/zandalarian-hero-charm) is rewarded for turning in [![The Heart of Hakkar](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/quest-start.gif) The Heart of Hakkar](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8183/the-heart-of-hakkar), it is roughly equally as strong as [![Talisman of Ephemeral Power](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_stonetablet_11.gif) Talisman of Ephemeral Power](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18820/talisman-of-ephemeral-power), the main benefit is that these trinkets have a different length cooldown, which allows for swapping of the trinkets out of combat if you obtain both.  
  
[![Hazza'rah's Charm of Destruction](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_19.gif) Hazza'rah's Charm of Destruction](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19957/hazzarahs-charm-of-destruction) is a warlock-only trinket obtained from the Zul Gurub madness event. Whilst the trinket isn't all that useful in Classic, where it does shine is in TBC, here the destruction only crit gets converted in normal critical rating and applies to Seed of Corruption, one of the main AoE spells that is driven by crit.   
  
[![The Black Book](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_book_06.gif) The Black Book](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19337/the-black-book) is another warlock classic. Whilst we don't want to be caught wearing it during a boss fight, it does shine right before it. We can use the active portion of this trinket to buff our pet right before a fight starts when we can still swap back to our other trinkets. This bonus is a buff on the pet which will stay active even after swapping out the trinkets. Note that this will only be beneficial if your pet actually does any DPS.

### Weapons and Offhands for Warlock DPS in Season of Mastery Phase 5

#### Two Hand Weapons

[![Staff of the Shadow Flame](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_staff_06.gif) Staff of the Shadow Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19356/staff-of-the-shadow-flame) is slightly stronger than the best offhand + main-hand combination we can get without getting to rank 14 in PvP. But know that for upcoming phases the main-hand + offhand combination will be the way to go, so getting a stronger main hand right now might set you up better for the future. If you however like [Kralnor](https://web.archive.org/web/20060209024851/http://www.saichotictech.net/Others/Kralnor/Kralnorp1.htm) REALLY like staffs here are a couple you can use. LOOK IT OVER.

#### Main Hand Weapons

[![Grand Marshal's Mageblade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_shortblade_26.gif) Grand Marshal's Mageblade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23451/grand-marshals-mageblade) or [![High Warlord's Spellblade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_shortblade_26.gif) High Warlord's Spellblade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23466/high-warlords-spellblade) last until phase five at the minimum. It however does require rank 14. This time around might be ever slightly easier due to the faster-ranking system in place. For those of us not ranking to rank 14, there is [![Claw of Chromaggus](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_shortblade_28.gif) Claw of Chromaggus](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19347/claw-of-chromaggus). The con is that all non-ranking casters and their mother will be after this weapon. As such it is a good idea that in the meantime until you have this weapon or the rank 14 opt for one of the weapons listed as "*Mediocre*" beneath.

This was locked in Classic until phase 5 intended as a catch-up item. In Seasons of Mastery, this item is available from the get-go.  
  
Other strong contenders are the [![Master Dragonslayer's Orb](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_orb_03.gif) Master Dragonslayer's Orb](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19366/master-dragonslayers-orb), [![Tome of Shadow Force](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_book_06.gif) Tome of Shadow Force](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19309/tome-of-shadow-force), and [![Therazane's Touch](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_branch_01.gif) Therazane's Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19315/therazanes-touch).   
  
Sadly we will no longer see the [Drakestone Hall of Fame](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16SaU_q81UO0pSjptnA1-dG7-yU9q6GAxPAbwyoVB8ms/edit?usp=sharing) of people farming for the correct suffix of [![Drakestone](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_orb_03.gif) Drakestone](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=10796/drakestone) of Shadow Wrath in the Sunken Temple as we did back in 2019. When this item was Best in Slot until Phase 5 and people did over 1000 runs to get it!

#### Wands

[![Touch of Chaos](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_wand_09.gif) Touch of Chaos](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19861/touch-of-chaos) is the first raid-worthy wand to equip. It is a significant step up from our previously available wands.  
  
There are not that many wand options early on. Mostly you will be looking into getting [![Skul's Ghastly Touch](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bone_elfskull_01.gif) Skul's Ghastly Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13396/skuls-ghastly-touch) that drops of [Skul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=10393/skul), a rare in [Stratholme](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2017/stratholme). You can use your [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_shadow_evileye.gif) Eye of Kilrogg](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=126/eye-of-kilrogg) to look if the dungeon ID has him up.  
  
[![Cold Snap](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_wand_01.gif) Cold Snap](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19130/cold-snap) is the odd duck in the list. You will only want this wand in preparation for Phase 5 with the release of [Ahn'Qiraj](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3428/ahnqiraj) and [Viscidus](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15299/viscidus) inside. Viscidus takes increased Frost Damage, which this wand is one of the best for. Along with [![Wand of Biting Cold](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_wand_01.gif) Wand of Biting Cold](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19108/wand-of-biting-cold) which is rewarded for [![Hero of the Stormpike](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/quest-start.gif) Hero of the Stormpike](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8271/hero-of-the-stormpike).
