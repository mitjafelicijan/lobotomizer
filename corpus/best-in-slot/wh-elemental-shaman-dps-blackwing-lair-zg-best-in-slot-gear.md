# Elemental Shaman DPS Best in Slot Gear Blackwing Lair & Zul'Gurub - WoW Classic Phase 4

Welcome to Wowhead's Phase 4 Blackwing Lair Best in Slot Gear list for Elemental Shaman DPS in WoW Classic. This guide will list the recommended gear for Elemental Shaman DPS from raids, dungeons, PvP, professions, world drops, reputations, and instances.

Best In Slot Gear for Elemental Shaman DPS Phase 4
--------------------------------------------------

In Phase 4, you will have access to [Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair) epic raid gear, PvP gear and powerful blue items from dungeons and quests across Azeroth, many of which were originally only available on later patches as a form of catch up gear.  
  
While gearing up, your main priority should be damage stats such as +Nature / Spell Damage, Spell Critical Strike and Spell Hit, all of which directly increase your DPS, whether you are in a short or long fight. In long fights, Mana sustain also becomes important, and as such you want to look out for Intellect and Mp5 on your gear whenever possible, as well.  
  
By going into the **gear planner links** below, you can edit in your own gear and simulate the effect of adding other pieces of gear, such as +Nature / Spell Damage items, which is especially recommended when starting out as many of these can be bought for cheap from the Auction House.  
  
While the list below contains a PvP off-hand and world boss shoes, you can replace them easily with any of the alternative gear we list in the slot by slot sections of this guide.

### Body Armor for Elemental Shaman DPS

The listed gear is mostly weighted on its +Nature / Spell Damage / Spell Hit and Spell Crit, with Mp5 and Intellect being considered as well. **Also, while there are a lot of options for each slot, we will mostly be listing only a few for each slot to avoid clutter.** You can find many other alternatives easily with the gear planner.

#### Head for Elemental Shaman DPS

[![Mish'undare, Circlet of the Mind Flayer](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_52.gif) Mish'undare, Circlet of the Mind Flayer](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19375/mishundare-circlet-of-the-mind-flayer) is the best helmet, and a significant upgrade over the second best option, [![Spellweaver's Turban](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_62.gif) Spellweaver's Turban](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22267/spellweavers-turban), which is also well ahead of the remaining helmets.

[![Deep Earth Spaulders](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_04.gif) Deep Earth Spaulders](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18829/deep-earth-spaulders) are the best shoulders available in this phase, and you should have next to no competition for them, making them very easy to acquire, as long as you can raid [Molten Core](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2717/molten-core). Alternatively, [![Mantle of the Blackwing Cabal](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_25.gif) Mantle of the Blackwing Cabal](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19370/mantle-of-the-blackwing-cabal) are also very strong, as are the PvP shoulders.

#### Back for Elemental Shaman DPS

[![Cloak of the Brood Lord](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_20.gif) Cloak of the Brood Lord](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19378/cloak-of-the-brood-lord) is the best cloak available, but [![Sapphiron Drape](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_16.gif) Sapphiron Drape](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17078/sapphiron-drape) is a decent alternative, alongside [![Crystalline Threaded Cape](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_19.gif) Crystalline Threaded Cape](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20697/crystalline-threaded-cape), which has more raw damage, but much lower support stats.

#### Chest for Elemental Shaman DPS

[![Robe of Volatile Power](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_cloth_18.gif) Robe of Volatile Power](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19145/robe-of-volatile-power) has a huge amount of Spell Crit, as well as other useful stats, making it the best Elemental chest. [![Breastplate of Ten Storms](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_chain_11.gif) Breastplate of Ten Storms](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16950/breastplate-of-ten-storms) and [![Wildthorn Mail](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_chain_12.gif) Wildthorn Mail](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12624/wildthorn-mail) are also very strong, and Wildthorn in particular is relatively easy to craft.

[![Dryad's Wrist Bindings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_bracer_13.gif) Dryad's Wrist Bindings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19595/dryads-wrist-bindings) are also great, but require a lengthy Warsong Gulch reputation farm.

[![Enamored Water Spirit](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_wand_01.gif) Enamored Water Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20503/enamored-water-spirit) is another cooldown item, which is obtained from a high level class trainer questline.

### Weapons and Offhands for Elemental Shaman DPS

#### Main Hand Weapons for Elemental Shaman DPS

With the release of [Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair) you can obtain [![Lok'amir il Romathis](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_06.gif) Lok'amir il Romathis](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19360/lokamir-il-romathis), the best Elemental [![Shaman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_shaman.gif) Shaman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=7/shaman) weapon in this phase, which is also relatively easy to get due to most caster classes lacking the ability to use maces. You can also use [![Claw of Chromaggus](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_shortblade_28.gif) Claw of Chromaggus](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19347/claw-of-chromaggus) as a decent alternative.  
  
[![Staff of the Shadow Flame](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_staff_06.gif) Staff of the Shadow Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19356/staff-of-the-shadow-flame) deserves a special mention for also being a very strong caster weapon, but is generally best left to Mages and Warlocks, who cannot use Lok'amir.  
  
[![High Warlord's Spellblade](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_weapon_shortblade_26.gif) High Warlord's Spellblade](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23466/high-warlords-spellblade) is still an amazing weapon and [![Mindfang](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_sword_13.gif) Mindfang](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20214/mindfang) can be obtained without needing to rank for it.

#### Off-Hands and Shields for Elemental Shaman DPS

[![Therazane's Touch](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_branch_01.gif) Therazane's Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19315/therazanes-touch) is a fantastic off-hand, and decidedly worth the [Alterac Valley](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2597/alterac-valley) grind. Alternatively, you can loot the [![Head of Nefarian](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_head_dragon_black.gif) Head of Nefarian](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19002/head-of-nefarian) for [![Master Dragonslayer's Orb](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_orb_03.gif) Master Dragonslayer's Orb](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19366/master-dragonslayers-orb).
