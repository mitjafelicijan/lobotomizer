Gearing Advice for Warrior Tank
-------------------------------

Gearing your [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior)Â Tank in WoW Classic highly depends on your raiding environment. Some guilds may require a higher threat ceiling to withstand the pressure from high-performing damage dealers, while other guilds may encourage erring on the side of caution and focusing solely on survival. Most guilds will require a little bit of both and it is up to each tank to decide on the **balance** between threat and mitigation they want to achieve based on their experience within their group and for different encounters.  
  
In this Best in Slot Guide, you will find a selection of the most **budget-efficient items balancing the highest threat and mitigation values** to get the most out of each armor slot, as well as separate threat-oriented or mitigation-oriented alternatives when applicable. Mix and match those suggestions to achieve the desired threat generation or survivability goal that is appropriate for your raid group.

### Weapon Skill

In vanilla WoW, all melee classes must reach **at least 305 weapon skills** for each equipped weapon type in order to reduce their chances to miss attacks against bosses by 3% and reduce the damage penalty from glancing blows (40% of melee swings against bosses, inevitable) by 20%. These benefits from +5 weapon skill result in a **7-10% damage increase** and are your first priority when gearing up a [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior).  
  
[![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human)s and [![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc)s can reach 305 weapon skill passively thanks to their racial abilities [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_meleedamage.gif) Sword Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20597/sword-specialization), [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_05.gif) Mace Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20864/mace-specialization), and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_02.gif) Axe Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20574/axe-specialization), making these two races the best picks to increase your damage output as a [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior).  
On the other hand, all the other races in the game without an innate weapon skill bonus will need to find said bonus from their gear, with items such as [![Edgemaster's Handguards](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_30.gif) Edgemaster's Handguards](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14551/edgemasters-handguards), [![Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_23.gif) Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18823/aged-core-leather-gloves) or [![Mugger's Belt](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_02.gif) Mugger's Belt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18505/muggers-belt), trading an armor slot to make up for inferior racial abilities. Thanks to these items, all races can reduce the damage penalty for not being [![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) or [![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) from a **7-10% damage loss** down to a **2-5% damage loss** depending on phases and available weapons.

### Helm for Warrior Tank

As standalone items, the [![Helm of Endless Rage](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_10.gif) Helm of Endless Rage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19372/helm-of-endless-rage) and [PvP R13 Helmet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16542) provide roughly the same amount of stats. The latter, however, takes over when you factor in the [set bonuses](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=383) for additional stats.  
  
The rare [![Circlet of Restless Dreams](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_17.gif) Circlet of Restless Dreams](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20623/circlet-of-restless-dreams) from [Emeriss](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=14889/emeriss), while appealing at first glance thanks to excellent stats on top of +6 daggers skill, is a worse option than [![Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_23.gif) Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18823/aged-core-leather-gloves) for your weapon skill. Due to a critical lack of good gloves prior to [Ahn'Qiraj](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3428/ahnqiraj), it is always more stats to stick to your [![Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_23.gif) Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18823/aged-core-leather-gloves) and take advantage of the excellent [![Helm of Endless Rage](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_10.gif) Helm of Endless Rage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19372/helm-of-endless-rage) and [PvP R13 Helmet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16542) than the opposite.  
  
**Recommended BiS Helm Enchant**: [![Presence of Might](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofwrath.gif) Presence of Might](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19782/presence-of-might)

### Neck for Warrior Tank

The [![Amulet of the Darkmoon](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_14.gif) Amulet of the Darkmoon](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19491/amulet-of-the-darkmoon) is a great substitute to the [![Onyxia Tooth Pendant](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_09.gif) Onyxia Tooth Pendant](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18404/onyxia-tooth-pendant) for a PvP Rank 12+ [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank trying to shave off some of the extra hit provided by the [PvP set](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=383). Alternatively, the [![The Eye of Hakkar](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_22.gif) The Eye of Hakkar](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19856/the-eye-of-hakkar) is also a good swap to drop some hit, albeit a bit more offensive.

* Similarly to the [![Onyxia Tooth Pendant](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_09.gif) Onyxia Tooth Pendant](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18404/onyxia-tooth-pendant) from the [![Head of Onyxia](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_head_dragon_01.gif) Head of Onyxia](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18422/head-of-onyxia), do not make the mistake of taking the [![Master Dragonslayer's Medallion](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_18.gif) Master Dragonslayer's Medallion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19383/master-dragonslayers-medallion) from the [![Head of Nefarian](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_head_dragon_black.gif) Head of Nefarian](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19002/head-of-nefarian) but take the much more valuable [![Master Dragonslayer's Ring](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_41.gif) Master Dragonslayer's Ring](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=230839/master-dragonslayers-ring) for a flexible hit swap and DPS gear.

### Shoulders for Warrior Tank

Similarly to the helmets, the [![Drake Talon Pauldrons](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_23.gif) Drake Talon Pauldrons](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19394/drake-talon-pauldrons) and [PvP R13 Shoulders](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16544) have roughly the same value for a [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank. The latter, however, takes over when you factor in the [set bonuses](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=383) for additional stats.  
  
The sick looking [![Defiler's Plate Spaulders](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_01.gif) Defiler's Plate Spaulders](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20212/defilers-plate-spaulders), available once exalted with your respective [Arathi Basin](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3358/arathi-basin) battleground reputation, are sadly irrelevant in this version of vanilla since the [PvP R10 items](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23243) are so easily available and you are likely to reach this rank far before reaching an exalted reputation in AB.  
  
**Recommended BiS Shoulder Inscription**: [![Zandalar Signet of Might](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_armorkit_08.gif) Zandalar Signet of Might](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20077/zandalar-signet-of-might)

### Back for Warrior Tank

All the epic cloaks are pretty much equal to a [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank so I recommend sticking to your [![Dragon's Blood Cape](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_08.gif) Dragon's Blood Cape](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17107/dragons-blood-cape) or [![Cloak of the Shrouded Mists](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_17.gif) Cloak of the Shrouded Mists](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17102/cloak-of-the-shrouded-mists) for as long as possible to avoid contesting DPS items that would only make a negligible difference to you.  
  
**Recommended BiS Cloak Enchant**: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Enchant Cloak - Lesser Agility](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=13882/enchant-cloak-lesser-agility) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Enchant Cloak - Fire Resistance](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=13657/enchant-cloak-fire-resistance)

### Bracers for Warrior Tank

The [Tier Bracers](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16959) are always a great pick up to boost your Effective Health and balance out an otherwise offensive gear set. Alternatively, the [![Zandalar Vindicator's Armguards](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_bracer_14.gif) Zandalar Vindicator's Armguards](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19824/zandalar-vindicators-armguards) are a great alternative to the [![Berserker Bracers](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_bracer_06.gif) Berserker Bracers](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19578/berserker-bracers) and much easier to obtain.  
The [![Wristguards of True Flight](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_bracer_02.gif) Wristguards of True Flight](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18812/wristguards-of-true-flight) remain a relevant hit swap for all of vanilla, should you need to adjust your hit at any point. However, I recommend first adjusting your hit via the [jewelry](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18404)Â [slots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=230839) to sacrifice the least amount of stats in the process.

### Hands for Warrior Tank

Thanks to their [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_meleedamage.gif) Sword Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20597/sword-specialization) racial, [![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human)s can wield swords and enjoy all the gloves upgrades in the game such as the [PvP R12 Glauntlets](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16484), [![Flameguard Gauntlets](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_26.gif) Flameguard Gauntlets](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19143/flameguard-gauntlets) or [![Gauntlets of Might](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_10.gif) Gauntlets of Might](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16863/gauntlets-of-might) for more hit.  
Other races however must choose between the expensive [![Edgemaster's Handguards](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_30.gif) Edgemaster's Handguards](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14551/edgemasters-handguards) to equip swords and take advantage of all the best tank weapons in the game, most notably [![Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_sword_39.gif) Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker), or [![Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_23.gif) Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18823/aged-core-leather-gloves) and instead use the less contested **Daggers**.

### Belt for Warrior Tank

The [![Mugger's Belt](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_02.gif) Mugger's Belt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18505/muggers-belt) is another way to obtain a weapon skill until you get your hands on [![Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_23.gif) Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18823/aged-core-leather-gloves) or [![Edgemaster's Handguards](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_30.gif) Edgemaster's Handguards](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14551/edgemasters-handguards) which will stay relevant for more phases.

### Legs for Warrior Tank

The [PvP Rank 12 Legs](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16543) are by far the best legs until [Ahn'Qiraj](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3428/ahnqiraj), especially paired with the just as excellent [PvP Rank 12 Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16545) for the [+20 Stamina set bonus](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=14467).  
  
The [![Legguards of the Fallen Crusader](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_plate_16.gif) Legguards of the Fallen Crusader](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19402/legguards-of-the-fallen-crusader) are the only new legs drop for [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) in [Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair). However, they only drop for **![](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/27798.png)Alliance raids** so it is especially important for ![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/icons/horde.png)Â HordeÂ [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior)s to rank up at least to PvP rank 8, and ideally 12 for the excellent [PvP legs](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16543).

### Boots for Warrior Tank

Although the [![Chromatic Boots](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_plate_04.gif) Chromatic Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19387/chromatic-boots) are technically the best boots as a standalone item, the [PvP Rank 12 Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16545) are almost identical and take over when factoring the [+20 Stamina set bonus](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=14467) you get by combining the boots with the [PvP Rank 12 Legs](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16543). These two items unlock at the same PvP rank and always go hand-in-hand as the BiS item in their respective slot until Phase 4.   
  
The [![Chromatic Boots](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_plate_04.gif) Chromatic Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19387/chromatic-boots) are BiS until TBC for FuryÂ [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior)s, while they are easily substituted by the [R12 Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16545) for tanks, and later by multiple drops from [Ahn'Qiraj](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3428/ahnqiraj) and [Naxxramas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3456/naxxramas) so it is best practice not to contest your fellow [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior)s for it.

### Rings for Warrior Tank

All epic rings perform roughly the same for a [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank. As a result, there isn't really a "best" ring, and they are more situational.  
If you need hit to reach the 6% cap, you will gravitate toward [![Master Dragonslayer's Ring](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_41.gif) Master Dragonslayer's Ring](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19384/master-dragonslayers-ring), [![Don Julio's Band](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_35.gif) Don Julio's Band](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19325/don-julios-band) and [![Band of Accuria](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_15.gif) Band of Accuria](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17063/band-of-accuria). On the other hand, you will prefer [![Circle of Applied Force](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_37.gif) Circle of Applied Force](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19432/circle-of-applied-force), [![Archimtiros' Ring of Reckoning](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_40.gif) Archimtiros' Ring of Reckoning](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19376/archimtiros-ring-of-reckoning) or [![Myrmidon's Signet](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_05.gif) Myrmidon's Signet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=2246/myrmidons-signet) if your armor pieces already provide enough hit.

### Trinkets for Warrior Tank

The iconic [![Diamond Flask](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_drink_01.gif) Diamond Flask](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20130/diamond-flask) obtained as a reward from the [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) quest [![Voodoo Feathers](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/quest-start.gif) Voodoo Feathers](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8425/voodoo-feathers) is one of the best trinkets in the game until TBC and a **must-have**, so don't pick the wrong reward when turning in the quest or you will brick your character. It increases your strength by +75 for a full minute and will be your best trinket by a landslide up to [Naxxramas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3456/naxxramas).  
  
The second best trinket is the highly coveted [![Drake Fang Talisman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bone_06.gif) Drake Fang Talisman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19406/drake-fang-talisman). It's a great passive trinket to equip and forget about for an entire raid, or to fall back to when your other, better trinkets are on cooldown in future phases. That being said, it's not as big of a deal as every class discord's propaganda will try to make you believe. For a [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank, this trinket is about equivalent to [![Hand of Justice](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_01.gif) Hand of Justice](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11815/hand-of-justice) when it comes to threat generation, with an additional ~1.5% incoming damage reduction from the dodge chance.  
Similarly to [![Band of Accuria](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_15.gif) Band of Accuria](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17063/band-of-accuria), the main benefit of [![Drake Fang Talisman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bone_06.gif) Drake Fang Talisman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19406/drake-fang-talisman) is the gear flexibility enabled by these 2% hit items, which in turn let you equip more balanced or more mitigation-oriented items such as [![Helm of Endless Rage](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_10.gif) Helm of Endless Rage](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19372/helm-of-endless-rage), [![Bracelets of Wrath](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_bracer_19.gif) Bracelets of Wrath](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16959/bracelets-of-wrath) or [![Archimtiros' Ring of Reckoning](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_40.gif) Archimtiros' Ring of Reckoning](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19376/archimtiros-ring-of-reckoning) in slots you would traditionally use for hit items.  
  
The [![Lifegiving Gem](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gem_pearl_05.gif) Lifegiving Gem](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19341/lifegiving-gem) is another good trinket to pick up in [Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair) for difficult encounters where you may want an additional defensive cooldown in the form of a mini-[![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_ashestoashes.gif) Last Stand](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=12975/last-stand), increasing your HP by 15% for 20 seconds. The additional HP buffer can be a lifesaver against bosses that can burst you down unexpectedly, such as [Broodlord Lashlayer](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12017/broodlord-lashlayer) or the three [Drakes](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=11983) with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_ghoulfrenzy.gif) Thrash](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=3391/thrash) attacks.   
  
The [![Nat Pagle's Broken Reel](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gizmo_09.gif) Nat Pagle's Broken Reel](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19947/nat-pagles-broken-reel) is another niche trinket worth picking up for future phases. In vanilla WoW, [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_reincarnation.gif) Taunt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=355/taunt) is considered a spell and thus won't benefit from your melee hit bonuses, which leads to high chances of resist against bosses. The [![Nat Pagle's Broken Reel](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gizmo_09.gif) Nat Pagle's Broken Reel](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19947/nat-pagles-broken-reel) can improve your odds of landing a [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_reincarnation.gif) Taunt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=355/taunt) in crucial situations, such as tank swaps against [The Four Horsemen](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/object=181366) later in [Naxxramas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3456/naxxramas).

### Main-Hand Weapons for Warrior Tank

* **What makes a good tank weapon?**  
  [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tanks will generate increased rage from incoming damage and want to use a fast weapon in their main-hand to unload their rage bar as fast as possible with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_rogue_ambush.gif) Heroic Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=25286/heroic-strike) for additional damage and threat. A faster weapon will also make your rage generation and threat generation steadier with faster attacks to help mitigate the dangerous variance from dodged or parried attacks on pull.

[![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human)s must wield **Swords** or **Maces** to benefit from their racial abilities [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_meleedamage.gif) Sword Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20597/sword-specialization) and [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_05.gif) Mace Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20864/mace-specialization), while [![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc)s must wield **Axes** to benefit from [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_02.gif) Axe Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20574/axe-specialization). Raising your weapon skill with said weapons to 305 instead of the baseline 300 reduces your chances to miss attacks against bosses by 3% and reduces the damage penalty from glancing blows (40% of melee swings against bosses, inevitable) by 20%, resulting in a **7-10% damage and threat increase** for using the proper weapon types.  
  
**All other races** without an innate racial ability to increase their weapon skills will have to use [![Edgemaster's Handguards](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_30.gif) Edgemaster's Handguards](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14551/edgemasters-handguards), [![Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_23.gif) Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18823/aged-core-leather-gloves) or [![Mugger's Belt](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_02.gif) Mugger's Belt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18505/muggers-belt) as an alternative to try and bridge the gap with [![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human)Â [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior)s.  
With [![Edgemaster's Handguards](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_30.gif) Edgemaster's Handguards](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14551/edgemasters-handguards) equipped, you'll want to aim for the same fast swords as [![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human)s or daggers. With [![Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_23.gif) Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18823/aged-core-leather-gloves) or [![Mugger's Belt](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_02.gif) Mugger's Belt](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18505/muggers-belt), you will use daggers for their high speed and relatively low competition.  
  
Despite their [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_02.gif) Axe Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20574/axe-specialization) racial, [![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc) tanks will also want to use **swords** paired with [![Edgemaster's Handguards](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_30.gif) Edgemaster's Handguards](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14551/edgemasters-handguards) or [![Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_23.gif) Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18823/aged-core-leather-gloves) and **daggers** just like other races due to the lack of fast axes available in raids. [![Bone Slicing Hatchet](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_11.gif) Bone Slicing Hatchet](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18737/bone-slicing-hatchet) and [![Serathil](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_08.gif) Serathil](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13015/serathil) are pretty much the last fast axes (<2.0 speed) in the game and subsequent axes from raids are too slow and will perform worse than daggers from the same tier. The [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_02.gif) Axe Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20574/axe-specialization) racial however is still useful for your off-hand weapons less reliant on speed.

* [Zul'Gurub](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=1977/zulgurub) introduces the powerful [The Twin Blades of Hakkari](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=461/the-twin-blades-of-hakkari) set, which grants the wielder [a bonus of +6 sword skill](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=15763) when wielding both the [Main Hand](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19865) and the [Off Hand](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19866) Hakkari blades. These two swords together can let any non-[![Human](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_human_male.gif) Human](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=1/human) tank [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) get over the 305 weapon skill threshold for reduced miss chances and glancing penalty, letting you drop [![Edgemaster's Handguards](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_30.gif) Edgemaster's Handguards](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=14551/edgemasters-handguards) or [![Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_23.gif) Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18823/aged-core-leather-gloves) until next phase.  
  While not as powerful as [![Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_sword_39.gif) Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker), [The Twin Blades of Hakkari](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=461/the-twin-blades-of-hakkari) set performs on par with the PvP Rank 14 [Quickblades](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23467) with the advantage of freeing your gloves slot to unlock the [6/6 +40 AP set bonus](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=383), so they are definitely worth grabbing for every tank.

* **[![Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_sword_39.gif) Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker)**  
  Starting from Phase 3, lucky [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tanks who were blessed with 2x [![Bindings of the Windseeker](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_ice_lament.gif) Bindings of the Windseeker](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18563/bindings-of-the-windseeker) in [Molten Core](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2717/molten-core) will be able to craft the legendary [![Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_sword_39.gif) Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker). Not only is it one of the best looking weapons ever created in WoW, it's also an incredible weapon for [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tanks that will **remain BiS until TBC**.   
  The [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_cyclone.gif) Thunderfury](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=21992/thunderfury) procs alone are responsible for a ~7% increase in damage and **~10% increase in threat generation** thanks to bonus threat values. Furthermore, the **passive 20% attack slow** it applies to enemies reduces incoming damage by a significant 15%. And as the cherry on top, said proc bounces to up to 5 targets, generating some AoE threat that is desperately lacking from the [![Warrior](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/class_warrior.gif) Warrior](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/class=1/warrior) tank toolkit in vanilla.

**Recommended BiS Weapon Enchants**: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Enchant Weapon - Crusader](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20034/enchant-weapon-crusader)

### Off-Hand Weapons for Warrior Tank

Although a fast off-hand will share the same advantages as a fast main-hand to make your rage and threat generation smoother with faster attacks, speed is not as much of a priority for the off-hand.   
While I recommend sticking to daggers to reduce the competition on weapons within your raid, technically speaking [![Orc](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/race_orc_male.gif) Orc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/race=2/orc)s can leverage their [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_axe_02.gif) Axe Specialization](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20574/axe-specialization) racial ability here and add axes to their pool of suitable off-hand weapons. Refer to the [Fury BiS list](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/wow-classic-fury-warrior-dps-blackwing-lair-best-in-slot-gear#off-hand-weapons) for a ranking of good axes to consider.
