### Body Armor for Feral Druid Tank

#### Head for Feral Druid Tank

The Rank 13 PvP helm is best in slot by a landslide, and will not be replaced for the entire game, as the 2-piece set bonus is optimal even after you have access to [Naxxramas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3456/naxxramas) gear! The next best option in Phase 5 for individual stat value is the pre-raid helm [![Mask of the Unforgiven](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bandana_01.gif) Mask of the Unforgiven](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13404/mask-of-the-unforgiven), but the Rank 10 helm comes out ahead once the 2-piece set bonus is factored in. Note that on any fight where you are not tanking 100% of the time, for example when tanking Flamewalker adds in the [Lucifron](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12118/lucifron) and [Gehennas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=12259/gehennas) encounters, then wearing [![Wolfshead Helm](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_04.gif) Wolfshead Helm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8345/wolfshead-helm) is mandatory so that you can powershift effectively in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_catform.gif) Cat Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=768/cat-form) when not actively tanking.  
  
**Recommended BiS Helm Enchant**: [![Arcanum of Rapidity](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gem_02.gif) Arcanum of Rapidity](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18329/arcanum-of-rapidity)  
The 1% Haste helm enchant is *twice* as good as the 8 Agility enchant for bear tanks, even when considering both the Threat and mitigation value of Agility together. Helms other than [![Wolfshead Helm](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_helmet_04.gif) Wolfshead Helm](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=8345/wolfshead-helm) will never be used while DPSing, so using the optimal tank TPS enchant on your PvP helm / [![Mask of the Unforgiven](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bandana_01.gif) Mask of the Unforgiven](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13404/mask-of-the-unforgiven) is a no-brainer.

#### Shoulders for Feral Druid Tank

[![Highlander's Leather Shoulders](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_24.gif) Highlander's Leather Shoulders](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20059/highlanders-leather-shoulders) / [![Defiler's Leather Shoulders](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_24.gif) Defiler's Leather Shoulders](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20194/defilers-leather-shoulders), from Exalted reputation with [The League of Arathor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/faction=509/the-league-of-arathor) / [The Defilers](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/faction=510/the-defilers), outclass all PvE alternatives until [![Mantle of Wicked Revenge](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_shoulder_30.gif) Mantle of Wicked Revenge](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=21665/mantle-of-wicked-revenge) in Phase 5, which is only a Threat sidegrade.

#### Back for Feral Druid Tank

[![Puissant Cape](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_06.gif) Puissant Cape](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18541/puissant-cape) remains the highest overall value tanking cloak for Feral Druids in Phase 5, and will last you all the way until [![Cloak of the Fallen God](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_10.gif) Cloak of the Fallen God](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=21710/cloak-of-the-fallen-god) from AQ40. However, [![Dragon's Blood Cape](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_cape_08.gif) Dragon's Blood Cape](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17107/dragons-blood-cape) is an excellent mitigation swap when gearing for more survivability, and is also the next best option overall if you do not have access to world boss loot.  
  
**Recommended BiS Cloak Enchant**: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Enchant Cloak - Lesser Agility](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=13882/enchant-cloak-lesser-agility) / [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Enchant Cloak - Superior Defense](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20015/enchant-cloak-superior-defense)  
Either cloak enchant can be used based on personal preference, but both are very low impact. Note that the bonus armor provided by [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Enchant Cloak - Superior Defense](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20015/enchant-cloak-superior-defense) does *not* scale with [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_bearform.gif) Dire Bear Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9634/dire-bear-form) or [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_pelt_bear_03.gif) Thick Hide](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=16930/thick-hide), unlike armor on gear pieces.

#### Chest for Feral Druid Tank

[Blackwing Lair](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=2677/blackwing-lair) introduces only a small handful of gear upgrades for Feral Druids, and only a select few of these are highly impactful relative to alternative options. The leather off-piece chest from [Ebonroc](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=14601/ebonroc), [![Malfurion's Blessed Bulwark](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_leather_08.gif) Malfurion's Blessed Bulwark](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19405/malfurions-blessed-bulwark), is one of these select few, providing an enormous Armor upgrade in [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_racial_bearform.gif) Dire Bear Form](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9634/dire-bear-form) relative to all alternatives, and it will not be replaced until you obtain [![Ghoul Skin Tunic](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_leather_02.gif) Ghoul Skin Tunic](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23226/ghoul-skin-tunic) in [Naxxramas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3456/naxxramas).

#### Wrist for Feral Druid Tank

[![Blackmist Armguards](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_bracer_07.gif) Blackmist Armguards](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=12966/blackmist-armguards) remain the highest value tanking bracers for Ferals throughout Phase 5, making them well worth the pre-raid grind. However, [![Forest Stalker's Bracers](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_bracer_12.gif) Forest Stalker's Bracers](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19587/forest-stalkers-bracers) are only very slightly worse for tank value but lack Hit, making them the superior choice when your gear set is already Hit capped.  
  
**Recommended BiS Bracer Enchant**: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Enchant Bracer - Superior Strength](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20010/enchant-bracer-superior-strength) / [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Enchant Bracer - Superior Stamina](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20011/enchant-bracer-superior-stamina)

#### Hands for Feral Druid Tank

The glove slot is another place where PvP gear reigns supreme, and the Rank 12 gloves will not be replaced until [![Gloves of the Hidden Temple](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_19.gif) Gloves of the Hidden Temple](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=21605/gloves-of-the-hidden-temple) in AQ40. The next best option is the [Devilsaur Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=143/devilsaur-armor) set, provided you have enough Hit budget available in your gear set to accommodate the set bonus. If your gear set is already Hit capped, then the best alternatives to the Rank 12 gloves are [![Doomhide Gauntlets](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_22.gif) Doomhide Gauntlets](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18544/doomhide-gauntlets) and [![Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_23.gif) Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18823/aged-core-leather-gloves). In either case, [![Slaghide Gauntlets](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_22.gif) Slaghide Gauntlets](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13258/slaghide-gauntlets) are an efficient mitigation swap that can be used situationally when needed.

#### Legs for Feral Druid Tank

The optimal choice of leg armor depends indirectly on the other itemization in your gear set. If you do not plan on PvPing at all, then you will continue to wear [![Devilsaur Leggings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_wolf.gif) Devilsaur Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=15062/devilsaur-leggings) alongside [![Devilsaur Gauntlets](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_26.gif) Devilsaur Gauntlets](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=15063/devilsaur-gauntlets) in most tanking situations throughout Phase 5 due to the strong set bonus. When gearing for more mitigation, it is worth breaking the Devilsaur set with [![Slaghide Gauntlets](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_22.gif) Slaghide Gauntlets](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13258/slaghide-gauntlets), in which case [![Abyssal Leather Leggings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_leather_05.gif) Abyssal Leather Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20665/abyssal-leather-leggings) of Striking are the optimal leg pairing to use instead. The other scenario in which a non-PvPer should wear [![Abyssal Leather Leggings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_leather_05.gif) Abyssal Leather Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20665/abyssal-leather-leggings) of Striking is after acquiring both [![Boots of the Shadow Flame](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_cloth_05.gif) Boots of the Shadow Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19381/boots-of-the-shadow-flame) and [![Drake Fang Talisman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bone_06.gif) Drake Fang Talisman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19406/drake-fang-talisman): in this scenario, there is simply not enough available Hit budget in the gear set to accommodate the [Devilsaur Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=143/devilsaur-armor) set bonus.  
  
If you achieve Rank 12 in PvP, then [![Marshal's Dragonhide Legguards](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_06.gif) Marshal's Dragonhide Legguards](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16450/marshals-dragonhide-legguards) / [![General's Dragonhide Leggings](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_06.gif) General's Dragonhide Leggings](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=16552/generals-dragonhide-leggings) will be your default leg choice for almost the entirety of Classic, replaced only in [Naxxramas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3456/naxxramas) by [![Leggings of Apocalypse](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_leather_09.gif) Leggings of Apocalypse](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23071/leggings-of-apocalypse). If you do not rank up to 12 but still PvP enough to achieve Exalted [Warsong Gulch](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3277/warsong-gulch) reputation, then you will have access to [![Sentinel's Leather Pants](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_leather_12.gif) Sentinel's Leather Pants](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22749/sentinels-leather-pants) / [![Outrider's Leather Pants](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_pants_leather_12.gif) Outrider's Leather Pants](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22740/outriders-leather-pants), which are the second best leg option in Phase 5 and pack the highest raw mitigation stats of any legs in the game. In this scenario, the WSG pants are still more than good enough to be worth breaking the Devilsaur bonus, in which case [![Doomhide Gauntlets](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_22.gif) Doomhide Gauntlets](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18544/doomhide-gauntlets) or [![Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_23.gif) Aged Core Leather Gloves](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18823/aged-core-leather-gloves) can be used over [![Devilsaur Gauntlets](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_gauntlets_26.gif) Devilsaur Gauntlets](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=15063/devilsaur-gauntlets) in the glove slot due to their superior stats. Finally, if you have access to the Rare PvP set but not the Epic one, then the Rank 8 pants will be your optimal choice when paired with the Rank 10 helm for the 2-piece bonus.

#### Feet for Feral Druid Tank

[![Boots of the Shadow Flame](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_cloth_05.gif) Boots of the Shadow Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19381/boots-of-the-shadow-flame) are by far the most impactful upgrade for Feral tanks in Phase 5: they are the highest EHP boots for bears in the entire game due to their heavily inflated Armor budget, and *also* pack impressive Threat stats. There are no remotely comparable boot options (in terms of overall Threat plus mitigation value) for the rest of the game, so there is a strong case for Feral tanks to receive elevated priority on this item.  
  
**Recommended BiS Feet Enchant**: [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_greaterheal.gif) Enchant Boots - Minor Speed](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=13890/enchant-boots-minor-speed)  
Some form of movement speed enhancement is mandatory for competitive raiding, as even a very slight improvement in active uptime on raid bosses or trash mobs vastly outweighs the contribution from a few additional stats. This is *especially* true for tanks, who are often responsible for initiating pulls and positioning mobs.

### Jewelry for Feral Druid Tank

#### Neck for Feral Druid Tank

Just as in original Classic, [![Onyxia Tooth Pendant](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_necklace_09.gif) Onyxia Tooth Pendant](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18404/onyxia-tooth-pendant) is the best Feral neck in Phase 5 by a substantial margin. Even in heavily mit skewed gear sets, the Onyxia neck is miles ahead of the raid alternatives [![Eskhandar's Collar](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_belt_12.gif) Eskhandar's Collar](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18205/eskhandars-collar) and [![Medallion of Steadfast Might](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_amulet_03.gif) Medallion of Steadfast Might](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17065/medallion-of-steadfast-might), which uninformed loot councils will often try and force onto Feral Druids.

#### Rings for Feral Druid Tank

[![Band of Accuria](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_15.gif) Band of Accuria](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17063/band-of-accuria) outclasses all other Phase 5 rings, and is BiS for Feral tanks for the *entire game*, provided that you have available "Hit budget" in your gear set to utilize its full Hit value. This ring is also insanely valuable for cat DPS, making it the most important raid drop to prioritize in Phase 1 and 2. BoA will be heavily contested by all physical DPS classes, but Ferals have a strong case for high priority on this item given its longevity and impact.  
  
For most tanking situations, the optimal choice in the second ring slot is [![Master Dragonslayer's Ring](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_41.gif) Master Dragonslayer's Ring](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19384/master-dragonslayers-ring), but obtaining this ring is not a high priority since it is only a minor upgrade over [![Don Julio's Band](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_35.gif) Don Julio's Band](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19325/don-julios-band) from Phase 1. Alternatively, [![Archimtiros' Ring of Reckoning](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_40.gif) Archimtiros' Ring of Reckoning](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19376/archimtiros-ring-of-reckoning) or [![Heavy Dark Iron Ring](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_14.gif) Heavy Dark Iron Ring](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18879/heavy-dark-iron-ring) can be used over [![Master Dragonslayer's Ring](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_41.gif) Master Dragonslayer's Ring](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19384/master-dragonslayers-ring) / [![Don Julio's Band](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_ring_35.gif) Don Julio's Band](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19325/don-julios-band) as efficient mitigation swaps when needed.

#### Trinkets for Feral Druid Tank

The highly coveted [![Drake Fang Talisman](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_bone_06.gif) Drake Fang Talisman](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19406/drake-fang-talisman) trinket (DFT) is the third most impactful upgrade for Druid tanks in Phase 5 (after [![Boots of the Shadow Flame](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_boots_cloth_05.gif) Boots of the Shadow Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19381/boots-of-the-shadow-flame) and [![Malfurion's Blessed Bulwark](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_chest_leather_08.gif) Malfurion's Blessed Bulwark](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19405/malfurions-blessed-bulwark)), providing a bear with 128 AP equivalent worth of TPS in a single item slot. Feral Druids who are fortunate enough to receive one of these rare trinkets will keep it permanently equipped until the very end of the game, as only [![Kiss of the Spider](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_trinket_naxxramas04.gif) Kiss of the Spider](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22954/kiss-of-the-spider) and [![Mark of the Champion](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_token_argentdawn2.gif) Mark of the Champion](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=23206/mark-of-the-champion) from [Naxxramas](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/zone=3456/naxxramas) have it beat in TPS output. One downside of this trinket, however, is that the majority of its TPS contribution comes from Hit, which means that gear sets utilizing DFT are often forced to give up other high value Hit items (such as the [Devilsaur Armor](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item-set=143/devilsaur-armor) set) in order to not exceed the 9% Hit cap.  
  
After DFT, [![Blackhand's Breadth](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_armorkit_09.gif) Blackhand's Breadth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13965/blackhands-breadth) and [![Mark of Tyranny](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_09.gif) Mark of Tyranny](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13966/mark-of-tyranny) are the best Threat and mitigation trinkets in Phase 5, respectively, but you will unfortunately have to choose between the two, as they are both rewards from the same pre-raid quest. Both of these trinkets provide very high value for their respective roles (TPS/DPS vs. mitigation), so there is no wrong choice here - either option can be correct depending on your raid environment and tanking role. If you will be DPSing often in your raid group or are tanking for very competitive DPS players, then [![Blackhand's Breadth](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_armorkit_09.gif) Blackhand's Breadth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13965/blackhands-breadth) is likely the better choice. Otherwise, for tanking specifically, [![Mark of Tyranny](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_09.gif) Mark of Tyranny](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13966/mark-of-tyranny) is the longer lasting of the two trinkets, as it remains situationally BiS for heavy mitigation scenarios throughout all of Classic, whereas [![Blackhand's Breadth](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_armorkit_09.gif) Blackhand's Breadth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13965/blackhands-breadth) is eventually replaced by superior DPS trinkets. If you opt for [![Blackhand's Breadth](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_armorkit_09.gif) Blackhand's Breadth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13965/blackhands-breadth), then [![Smoking Heart of the Mountain](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_gem_bloodstone_01.gif) Smoking Heart of the Mountain](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11811/smoking-heart-of-the-mountain) is the best alternative mitigation trinket to use in lieu of [![Mark of Tyranny](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_09.gif) Mark of Tyranny](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13966/mark-of-tyranny), but requires the Enchanting profession to craft. Conversely, if you opt for [![Mark of Tyranny](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_09.gif) Mark of Tyranny](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13966/mark-of-tyranny), then the best alternative Threat trinket in Phase 5 is [![Rune of the Guard Captain](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_rune_07.gif) Rune of the Guard Captain](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19120/rune-of-the-guard-captain), which provides almost identical TPS as [![Blackhand's Breadth](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_armorkit_09.gif) Blackhand's Breadth](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=13965/blackhands-breadth) but is unfortunately restricted to only Horde players.  
  
Unlike the first iteration of WoW Classic, [![Hand of Justice](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_01.gif) Hand of Justice](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11815/hand-of-justice) is *not* a competitive Threat trinket option for bears. This is because the 400 ms batch window in original Classic meant that the extra attacks from HoJ procs could be queued as Mauls rather than auto-attacks if the player was spamming their [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_maul.gif) Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9881/maul) bind when the proc occurred. Due to the removal of spell batching, this interaction is no longer possible, and HoJ procs exclusively generate white attacks that do not benefit from the inflated damage and Threat modifiers for [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_druid_maul.gif) Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=9881/maul).  
  
Finally, note that when tanking trash packs that are chain pulled, [![Mark of the Chosen](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_08.gif) Mark of the Chosen](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17774/mark-of-the-chosen) outperforms all of the above trinkets and should be permanently equipped. When you are either tanking multiple mobs simultaneously or progressing rapidly from one pack to the next, your average uptime for the [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_jewelry_talisman_08.gif) Mark of the Chosen Effect](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=21970/mark-of-the-chosen-effect) will be very high, and the resulting buff boosts both your TPS and survivability significantly. The trinket is especially powerful if you are able to get a proc on the final trash mob just before a boss pull, as the buff will then be active for a significant fraction of the subsequent boss fight.

### Weapons and Idols for Feral Druid Tank

#### Weapons for Feral Druid Tank

[![Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_14.gif) Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler) is the most important consumable for Feral Druids by a landslide, so expect to farm a ton of these over the course of Classic if you intend to raid competitively as a Feral. No other weapon comes remotely close in value, as MCP alone contributes  ***over 40%*** of your total TPS! **MCPs are so efficient in terms of TPS added per time spent farming that it is preferable to use literally no other consumables but come to raid with a full set of Pummelers, rather than stacking every other tanking consumable with a conventional weapon.** For Horde raids without [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_sealofsalvation.gif) Blessing of Salvation](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=1038/blessing-of-salvation), full MCP uptime should be considered a hard requirement for keeping aggro on raid bosses in even a somewhat competitive raid group. Alliance bears can technically get away without Pummelers, but should still always use at least one charge at the start of each boss pull in order to secure a solid early Threat lead and mitigate pull variance.  
  
For most players, MCPs will be used exclusively for boss fights, as it can be impractical to farm and carry sufficient quantities for trash usage as well. As a result, assuming you are not Rank 14, [![Draconic Maul](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_mace_05.gif) Draconic Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19358/draconic-maul) or [![Unyielding Maul](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_22.gif) Unyielding Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18531/unyielding-maul) should be used as the best alternative Threat and mitigation weapon choices for trash fights or 5-man dungeons. Contrary to popular belief, [![Unyielding Maul](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_22.gif) Unyielding Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18531/unyielding-maul) is *substantially* better than [![Warden Staff](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_staff_29.gif) Warden Staff](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=943/warden-staff) for bear tanks (and also much cheaper to obtain)! This is because the two weapons have near identical mitigation stats, but only [![Unyielding Maul](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_hammer_22.gif) Unyielding Maul](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=18531/unyielding-maul) is compatible with [![Iron Counterweight](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_orb_01.gif) Iron Counterweight](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6043/iron-counterweight), which is by far the highest value weapon enchant for bears even in mit skewed sets. For the same reason, Feral tanks will never consider 1-handed weapon options until the arrival of dedicated Feral Attack Power maces in Phase 5.  
  
**Recommended BiS Weapon Enchant**: [![Iron Counterweight](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_orb_01.gif) Iron Counterweight](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=6043/iron-counterweight)  
Counterweights are substantially better for bears than the alternative 25 Agility weapon enchant, whereas the opposite is true for cat DPS. Somewhat counterintuitively, the 3% Haste buff applies to your melee attacks while shapeshifted, and scales multiplicatively with both the 50% Haste from MCP as well as the three 1% Haste armor enchants. Counterweights are also quite cheap to craft, so it is actually practical to apply one to each of your Pummelers every week without breaking the bank. Because of this, taking the Blacksmithing profession can be a big quality of life boost for Feral Druids, allowing you to craft and apply your own Counterweights every week.
